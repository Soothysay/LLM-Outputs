","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest on [**2104-12-5**] at 08:30 AM and was successfully resuscitated. Shortly after, a pneumothorax was discovered on the right side, and a chest tube was placed. An arterial line was also inserted. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating in the 100s-200s range and has been self-regulated. Phosphate levels were repleted, and cooling measures were extended for a total of 24 hours post the second code. The patient has no known drug allergies. Infusions of Fentanyl, Amiodarone, Midazolam, and Cisatracurium are being administered. Hydralazine and Labetolol were given without effect. Heparin sodium is being used for prophylaxis. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced two cardiac arrests, indicating possible underlying heart issues or complications that could arise in the future.
2. Pneumothorax: The presence of a pneumothorax suggests a potential complication related to lung or pleural cavity problems, which may require further intervention or monitoring.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels indicate a potential electrolyte imbalance that needs to be managed to avoid cardiac arrhythm"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial picture given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. Currently retains pupilary reflexes but no corneals,
   gag, or dolls eyes; however is paralyzed and sedated at present for
   cooling protocol.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol 18-24 hours
   - Cisatricurium for NM blockade; also fentanyl and versed gtt, will
   wean once warm.
   - Amiodarone gtt
   - Head CT and detailed neuro exam once cooling completed
   - SW consult to attempt to find family (both numbers available in OMR
   called after event but both have been changed or disconnected)
   .
   # SOB: Multiple possible etiologies for initial presentation including
   COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider aspiration given EtOH) or
   other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given homeless).  ACS (ECG supports
   prior inferior MI and risk factors include male, smoker) or PE less
   likely given presentation. Most likely cause is COPD flare given long
   smoking history and wheezing on exam as no evidence for cavitation or
   infiltrate on CXR, no fever or leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP
   per EMS and no evidence of acute ECG changes including no RV strain.
   Patient refused ABG in the ED. Initial CXR without acute process but
   now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent aspiration from
   event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF.
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tube for pneumothorax
   - Repeat K+, consider treating if remains elevated resuscitation
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH but then
   decreased to mid-20s prior to leaving AMA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had seizure when
   leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptosm of sepsis and
   received levofloxacin in the ED. Lactate now elevated post-arrest,
   continue to trend.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks. Recheck labs and consider adding ASA 325mg. Hold beta blocker
   until cooling complete. Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, and EtOH abuse. He initially presented with shortness of breath and was likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced a cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing management and has several medical complications. These include:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient has chest tubes placed on both sides, with the left chest tube having an air leak. This indicates that there may still be air present in the pleural space, causing a pneumothorax.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are maintained at 100% with the use of supplemental oxygen.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.9 mEq/L. This can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and needs to be corrected.

4. Acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is low at 22 mEq/L, indicating metabolic acidosis. This could be due to respiratory distress, hypoperfusion, or other factors.

5. Seizure: The patient had a seizure during the initial event, which may have been related to hypoxia or an underlying seizure disorder.

6. Myocardial Infarction: The patient may have had a silent myocardial infarction, as evidenced by ECG"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial picture given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. Currently retains pupilary reflexes but no corneals,
   gag, or dolls eyes; however is paralyzed and sedated at present for
   cooling protocol.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol 18-24 hours
   - Cisatricurium for NM blockade; also fentanyl and versed gtt
   - Amiodarone gtt
   - Head CT and detailed neuro exam once cooling completed
   - SW consult to attempt to find family (both numbers available in OMR
   called after event but both have been changed or disconnected)
   .
   # SOB: Multiple possible etiologies for initial presentation including
   COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider aspiration given EtOH) or
   other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given homeless).  ACS (ECG supports
   prior inferior MI and risk factors include male, smoker) or PE less
   likely given presentation. Most likely cause is COPD flare given long
   smoking history and wheezing on exam as no evidence for cavitation or
   infiltrate on CXR, no fever or leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP
   per EMS and no evidence of acute ECG changes including no RV strain.
   Patient refused ABG in the ED. Initial CXR without acute process but
   now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent aspiration from
   event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF.
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Continue levofloxacin, consider changing to azithromycin for COPD
   flare should there be an absence of infiltrate
   - Consider adding flagyl
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tube for pneumothorax
   - Repeat K+, consider treating if remains elevated resuscitation
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH but then
   decreased to mid-20s prior to leaving AMA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had seizure when
   leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   - Thiamine, folic acid, MVI
   .
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptosm of sepsis and
   received levofloxacin in the ED. Lactate now elevated post-arrest,
   continue to trend.
   - f/u cultures
   - Broaden antibiotics if any evidence sepsis
   .
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks. Recheck labs and consider adding ASA 325mg. Hold beta blocker
   until cooling complete. Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced short periods of fluid-responsive hypotension, indicating a risk for further drops in blood pressure.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax, which is an accumulation of air in the pleural space and can cause respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, indicating a risk for future cardiac events.
5. Mixed acidosis: The patient has mixed acidosis, which may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and can be associated with poor outcomes if not promptly addressed.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, but there is a potential risk for hypoglycemia if insulin or other antidiabetic medications are used.
7. Infection: Although the patient's antibiotics were discontinued, there is still a possibility of infection due to the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial picture given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. Currently retains pupilary reflexes but no corneals,
   gag, or dolls eyes; however is paralyzed and sedated at present for
   cooling protocol.
   - Continue Arctic Sun protocol 18-24 hours
   - Cisatricurium for NM blockade; also fentanyl and versed gtt, will
   wean once warm.
   - Amiodarone gtt
   - Head CT and detailed neuro exam once cooling completed
   - SW consult to attempt to find family (both numbers available in OMR
   called after event but both have been changed or disconnected)
   .
   # SOB: Multiple possible etiologies for initial presentation including
   COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider aspiration given EtOH) or
   other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given homeless).  ACS (ECG supports
   prior inferior MI and risk factors include male, smoker) or PE less
   likely given presentation. Most likely cause is COPD flare given long
   smoking history and wheezing on exam as no evidence for cavitation or
   infiltrate on CXR, no fever or leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP
   per EMS and no evidence of acute ECG changes including no RV strain.
   Patient refused ABG in the ED. Initial CXR without acute process but
   now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent aspiration from
   event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF.
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tube for pneumothorax
   - Repeat K+, consider treating if remains elevated resuscitation
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH but then
   decreased to mid-20s prior to leaving AMA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had seizure when
   leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptosm of sepsis and
   received levofloxacin in the ED. Lactate now elevated post-arrest,
   continue to trend.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks. Recheck labs and consider adding ASA 325mg. Hold beta blocker
   until cooling complete. Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, and EtOH abuse. He initially presented with shortness of breath and was suspected to have a COPD exacerbation. However, he left against medical advice and later experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient received multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine in the emergency department, as well as three defibrillation shocks. He is currently intubated and sedated for a cooling protocol.

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including pneumonia (PNA), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, alcoholic hepatitis, and possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or bipolar disorder. The patient's family could not be reached for consent.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 75-172 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 112 and 192 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. His potassium levels have been consistently high, and his magnesium and phosphate levels are within normal range. The patient's kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and rewarmed, off paralytics
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Amiodarone gtt DCd since completed 24 hour load and ventricular
   arrhythmia occurred in setting of tension PTX, now resolved. Will not
   continue PO at this time unless further arrhythmias
   - Head CT prelim no pathology now cooling completed. F/U final read
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest. Will more fully assess neuron
   exam 72 hours post arrest to determine prognosis
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF. Unable to
   tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily SBT, no RSBI this am [**3-15**] bronchospasm, agitation . Maintain
   PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tol
   - Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm
   and agitation
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   - Chest tubes to suction until extubated
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH. [**Month (only) 51**] have had

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced two cardiac arrests with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. During the first arrest, he received multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine in the emergency department, as well as three defibrillation shocks. The second arrest occurred during the cooling protocol. The patient's neurologic examination showed minimal reaction with sedation but became tachypneic and agitated when sedation was weaned. A head CT showed no abnormalities, and the patient completed the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. Amiodarone was discontinued since completing the 24-hour load and ventricular arrhythmia occurred in the setting of tension pneumothorax, which has now resolved. The patient remains intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmia due to tension pneumothorax.
2. Respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation or aspiration pneumonia.
3. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with inferior myocardial infarction.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE) less likely given the presentation.
5. Hyperlactatemia with elevated lactate levels indicating possible hypoperfusion or increased work of breathing.
6. Possible sinus"

   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial picture given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. Currently retains pupilary reflexes but no corneals,
   gag, or dolls eyes; however is paralyzed and sedated at present for
   cooling protocol.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol  and rewarmed
   - Cisatricurium for NM blockade; also fentanyl and versed gtt, will
   wean.
   - Amiodarone gtt
   - Head CT prelim no pathology now cooling completed. F/U final read
   - SW consult to attempt to find family (both numbers available in OMR
   called after event but both have been changed or disconnected)
   .
   # SOB/resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF.
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs

   decreased to mid-20s prior to leaving AMA. [**Month (only) 51**] have had seizure when
   leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and likely COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest. The patient received multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine in the emergency department (ED), as well as three defibrillation shocks. He was intubated, sedated, and paralyzed for the cooling protocol. The head CT showed no pathology, and the patient has completed the Arctic Sun rewarming protocol.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone, cisatricurium for neuromuscular blockade, fentanyl, and versed. His vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 76 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 75 to 172 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 34.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 168K, sodium (Na) level of 143 mg/dL, potassium (K) level of 4"

   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and rewarmed, off paralytics
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Amiodarone gtt DCd since completed 24 hour load and ventricular
   arrhythmia occurred in setting of tension PTX, now resolved. Will not
   continue PO at this time unless further arrhythmias
   - Head CT prelim no pathology now cooling completed. F/U final read
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest. Will more fully assess neuron
   exam 72 hours post arrest to determine prognosis
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF. Unable to
   tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation

   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily SBT, no RSBI this am [**3-15**] bronchospasm, agitation . Maintain
   PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tol
   - Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm
   and agitation
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   - Chest tubes to suction until extubated
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH. [**Month (only) 51**] have had
   seizure when leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt for now
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   Lactate now trended down, 1.3.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who presented initially with shortness of breath likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice. During resuscitation, bilateral chest tubes were placed for pneumothorax. The patient underwent cooling and rewarming protocols after the second arrest. Currently, he is intubated and sedated on fentanyl and versed. He has purulent nasal drainage, which may indicate sinusitis. The patient's lactate levels are trending down, suggesting improvement in his condition. He is being monitored for potential complications such as hyperlactatemia, ETOH withdrawal, and respiratory failure. The patient's family has been updated, and efforts are being made to contact the closest family member who can serve as the healthcare proxy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient had bilateral chest tubes placed due to tension pneumothorax, which can cause respiratory distress and potentially lead to further complications.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced two cardiac arrests, which could be attributed to various factors including hypoxia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Further evaluation is required to determine the underlying cause.
3. Infection: The presence of purulent nasal drainage suggests a possible sinus infection. Additionally, the patient may be at risk for pneumonia due"

   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and rewarmed, off paralytics
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Head CT without intracranial pathology but has fluid in sinuses
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF. Unable to
   tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation
   - Increase Solumedrol to 125mg q8 hours for severe COPD
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, will discuss with thoracic
   surgery management of chest tubes and wall suction vs. water seal
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm
   and agitation
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   - sputum cultures and urine legionella
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH. [**Month (only) 51**] have had
   seizure when leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt for now
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   Lactate now trended down, 1.3.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath and was likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later had two cardiac arrests. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to bilateral pneumothoraces.

- The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia (Arctic Sun protocol) after the second cardiac arrest and has been rewarmed. He remains sedated since he becomes tachypneic and agitated when sedation is weaned.

- His current vital signs include a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 112/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His neurological examination shows minimal reaction, positive corneal reflexes, negative dolls' eyes, and no spontaneous movements of upper or lower extremities. He opens his eyes to noxious stimuli but does not follow commands.

- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

- The patient has purulent nasal drainage, which may indicate sinusitis. His chest X-ray reveals a possible right infiltrate, which could represent aspiration from the event or an evolving"

   # Agitation, hypertension, ETOH abuse: Likely due to alcohol
   withdrawal.  Will increase benzodiazepine doses and wean propofol.
   Mental status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently
   onboard.  Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing.
   - 10 mg valium Q 10 min until patient
s agitation resolves
   - prn valium for recurrent agitation
   - keep versed at 2-8 mg/hr
   - stop propofol
   - EEG to assess whether patient is seizing
   .
   #. Decreasing urine output: Patient appears euvolemic on exam.  Do not
   think that hypovolemia is due to hypoperfusion given elevated blood
   pressures.
   - bladder scan patient
   - confirm that foley is not obstructed
   - consider kidney ultrasound
   - urine lytes
   - consider 1L bolus if urine output does not improve and no evidence of
   obstruction.

He initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB), likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice (AMA). Subsequently, the patient experienced cardiac arrest twice and was resuscitated. He underwent bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax.

The patient's current condition includes agitation, hypertension, and signs of possible alcohol withdrawal. The mental status is difficult to assess due to the mix of drugs currently onboard. Eye twitching is observed, raising the possibility of seizures. The patient's urine output has been decreasing, and there is concern about potential obstruction or hypovolemia.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, likely caused by various factors including pneumothorax, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. The patient received multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine in the emergency department (ED), as well as defibrillation shocks. A cooling protocol was initiated, and the patient was successfully rewarmed. 

The patient's respiratory failure could be due to a COPD flare, pneumonia (especially considering the risk of aspiration given EtOH abuse), or other pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis (given the patient's homeless status). Acute chest syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE) are less likely. The initial chest X"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and rewarmed, off paralytics
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Head CT without intracranial pathology but has fluid in sinuses
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF. Unable to
   tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation
   - Increase Solumedrol to 125mg q8 hours for severe COPD
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, will discuss with thoracic
   surgery management of chest tubes and wall suction vs. water seal
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm
   and agitation
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   - sputum cultures and urine legionella
   .
   #ETOH abuse: No known h/o withdrawal, seizures, or DTs. Urine tox was
   negative in ED. Serum tox initially with elevate EtOH. [**Month (only) 51**] have had
   seizure when leaving AMA.
   - Continue versed gtt for now
   - Monitor for signs of withdrawal once sedation and paralytics off
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   Lactate now trended down, 1.3.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile
   -          F/U cx nasal drainage, viral swab
   -          Abx if spikes, hold for now
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker until BP controlled, consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**], slightly elevated on repeat but has had episodes
   hypotension, cardiac arrest.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB), likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x2 with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient has had multiple medical issues and complications, including possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, sinusitis, and a silent myocardial infarction (MI).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was likely due to a COPD exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory failure. The recent cardiac arrest and bilateral chest tubes suggest possible pneumothorax or ARDS, further increasing the risk of respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of possible infection, such as purulent drainage from the nostril, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and elevated lactate levels. These factors may indicate the development of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.

3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient experienced two cardiac arrests, one of which was associated with hypoxia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. There is also evidence of a silent MI, indicating underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). These cardiovascular complications pose significant risks to the patient"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal, oliguria/anuria, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiac arrest. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 139/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypotension, respiratory failure, COPD, acidosis, mixed, hypokalemia, pneumothorax, cardiac arrest, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and autonomic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and neurologic status is essential to prevent these complications.
2. Oliguria/anuria: The patient presents with oliguria/anuria, indicating inadequate urine output. This could be due to renal dysfunction, hypovolemia, or medication effects. Monitoring fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function is crucial to identify and manage this complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # Agitation, hypertension, ETOH abuse: Likely due to alcohol
   withdrawal.  Will increase benzodiazepine doses and wean propofol.
   Mental status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently
   onboard.  Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing.
   - 10 mg valium Q 10 min until patient
s agitation resolves
   - prn valium for recurrent agitation
   - keep versed at 2-8 mg/hr
   - stop propofol
   - EEG to assess whether patient is seizing
   .
   #. Decreasing urine output: Patient appears euvolemic on exam.  Do not
   think that hypovolemia is due to hypoperfusion given elevated blood
   pressures.
   - bladder scan patient
   - confirm that foley is not obstructed
   - consider kidney ultrasound
   - urine lytes
   - consider 1L bolus if urine output does not improve and no evidence of
   obstruction.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and rewarmed, off paralytics
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Head CT without intracranial pathology but has fluid in sinuses
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF. Unable to
   tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation
   - Cont. Solumedrol to 125mg q8 hours for severe COPD
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm
   and agitation
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   - resend urine legionella
   .
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   Lactate now trended down, 1.3.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile
   -          F/U cx nasal drainage, viral swab
   -          Abx if spikes, hold for now
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker until BP controlled, consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**], slightly elevated on repeat but has had episodes
   hypotension, cardiac arrest.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, and alcohol abuse. He initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice. He later returned after experiencing a cardiac arrest twice, with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation and Hypertension: The patient may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal, which can cause agitation and high blood pressure. Valium has been given for agitation, but the patient still requires 10 mg every 4 hours. EEG has been ordered to assess for possible seizures.
2. Decreased Urine Output: The patient had a decrease in urine output, which was resolved after replacing the clogged Foley catheter. Monitoring will continue to ensure adequate urine output.
3. Respiratory Failure: The initial presentation of shortness of breath could be due to a COPD flare-up, pneumonia (especially aspiration given the patient's history of alcohol abuse), or other pulmonary infections. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is less likely. The most probable cause is a COPD flare-up. Chest tubes have been placed for pneumothorax, which has sealed to vacuum.
4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has experienced two cardiac arrests, possibly due to factors such as pneumothorax, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, acidosis"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, opens eyes to noxious stimuli, and has eye twitching. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 139/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180.

The patient's physical examination reveals subcutaneous crepitus on chest examination, coarse ventilated breath sounds bilaterally, and no murmurs, gallops, or rubs on cardiac examination. He has a Foley catheter in place, which was recently replaced due to a clog. The patient's urine output"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with severe COPD and ETOH withdrawal admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has required valium for withdrawal and has had pneumothorax on both sides during codes, with bilateral chest tubes placed. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains unresponsive and on mechanical ventilation. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and normal liver function tests. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure due to severe COPD. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has had pneumothorax on both sides, which can recur if chest tubes are not properly managed or if there is a re-accumulation of air in the pleural space.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk of complications related to alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and autonomic instability. Close monitoring and appropriate medication management are crucial to prevent these complications.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. In the ICU setting, patients are at higher risk for developing healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Bleeding: The patient's slightly elevated potassium and prolonged PTT may indicate a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Ileus: The patient is not tolerating oral intake, which can lead to ileus. This can result in complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation if not addressed promptly.
7. DVT/PE: The patient is at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying risk factors. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be initiated to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # Agitation, hypertension, ETOH abuse: Likely due to alcohol
   withdrawal.  Propofol stopped yesterday.  Improved with addition of
   valium, though still requiring 10 mg IV Q4H.  Pt. not absorbing PO meds
   and thus not able to benefit from longer half-life of PO valium.
   Mental status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently
   onboard.  Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing
   though per report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed
   will suppress seizure activity.
   - Increase versed to 4-12 mg/hr
   - Cont. valium IV prn agitation
   - Consider repeat EEG when ETOH withdrawal & MS improves
   .
   #. Decreasing urine output: Resolved after replacement of clogged foley
   catheter.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation. Most likely
   cause is COPD flare given long smoking history and wheezing on exam as
   no evidence for cavitation or infiltrate on CXR, no fever or
   leukocytosis and no cough, and denied CP per EMS and no evidence of
   acute ECG changes including no RV strain. Initial CXR without acute
   process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could represent
   aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF. Unable to
   tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation.  As wheezing has improved
   dramatically will start to decrease steroids.
   - [**Month (only) **]. Solumedrol to 60 mg q8 hours
   - Continue Solumedrol, Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm
   and agitation
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   - resend urine legionella
   .
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Patient did not stool yesterday
   despite aggressive bowel regimen and is not tolerating tube feeds.
   High doses of opiates may be contributing.  Abdomen is currently soft.
   -          KUB to eval for obstruction.
   -          Bisacodyl suppository
   -          Change PO meds to IV banana bag + PR aspirin
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.
   - Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and rewarmed, off paralytics
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Head CT without intracranial pathology but has fluid in sinuses
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.# Hyperlactatemia: Elevated
   lactate on first admission with AG 13 and elevated bicarb. Bicarb
   likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory acidosis. Lactate may be
   elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of breathing with
   respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis. Lactate now
   trended down, 1.3.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile
   -          F/U cx nasal drainage, viral swab
   -          Abx if spikes, hold for now
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker until BP controlled, consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**], slightly elevated on repeat but has had episodes
   hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. not tolerating TFs.  Will need to hold if planned
   extubation; stop standing IVF and give 1L banana bag.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice and later experienced two cardiac arrests with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, showing signs of agitation, eye twitching, and hypertension, which are likely due to alcohol withdrawal. He has a mental status difficult to assess due to the mix of drugs onboard. There is a concern for seizure activity, but the EEG yesterday was negative for seizures. The patient's urine output was decreased, which resolved after replacing the clogged Foley catheter. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including possible pneumonia, aspiration, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or pulmonary embolism (PE), although PE seems less likely given the presentation. The most likely cause of his initial presentation is a COPD flare-up. The patient's respiratory status has improved dramatically, and the steroids are being decreased. He continues to receive chest tubes for pneumothorax, which is currently sealed to vacuum. The patient has poor intestinal absorption/motility, as he did not stool yesterday despite aggressive bowel regimen and is not tolerating tube feeds. High doses of opiates may be contributing to this issue. His abdomen is currently soft, and a KUB has been ordered to evaluate for obstruction. The patient's cardiac arrest eti"

   Assessment and Plan
 64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # Agitation, hypertension, ETOH abuse: Likely due to alcohol
   withdrawal.  Propofol stopped yesterday.  Improved with addition of
   valium, though still requiring 10 mg IV Q4H.  Pt. not absorbing PO meds
   and thus not able to benefit from longer half-life of PO valium.
   Mental status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently
   onboard.  Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing
   though per report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed
   will suppress seizure activity.
   - Weaning Versed
   - D/C valium now that he no longer has signs of withdrawal.
   - Consider repeat EEG if MS improves
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could
   represent aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF.
   Unable to tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation.  As wheezing has improved
   dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to extubation
   include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm and agitation.
   - Decrease Solumedrol to 60 mg q12 hours
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Patient did not stool yesterday
   despite aggressive bowel regimen and is not tolerating tube feeds.
   High doses of opiates may be contributing.  Abdomen is currently soft.
   -          KUB to eval for obstruction.
   -          Bisacodyl suppository + IV reglan
   -          IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile
   -          F/U cx nasal drainage, viral swab
   -          Abx if spikes, hold for now
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker until BP controlled, consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. not tolerating TFs.  stop standing IVF and give 1L banana
   bag/day.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient left against medical advice (AMA) but later returned after experiencing cardiac arrest twice with bilateral chest tube placements for pneumothorax.

The patient's current condition includes agitation, hypertension, and possible EtOH withdrawal. Mental status assessment is difficult due to the presence of multiple sedative medications. The patient also has respiratory failure with improved wheezing but still requires support. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia given the patient's EtOH abuse and the recent development of left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's abdomen is soft, and there may be poor intestinal absorption/motility as the patient did not stool yesterday despite aggressive bowel regimen.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which could be due to various etiologies such as pneumothorax, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. The patient received multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine in the emergency department, as well as three defibrillation shocks. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia protocol and has been sedated since then.

The patient also has elevated lactate levels, indicating possible hypoperfusion or increased work of breathing. There are no signs or symptoms of sepsis. The patient's"

   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm and
   agitation.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg q12 hours
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol weaned off.  Mental status difficult to
   assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but appears improved.
   Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing though per
   report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed will suppress
   seizure activity.
   - Continue fentanyl
   - Consider repeat EEG if MS improves
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   .
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Patient did pass some mucous
   yesterday, but no frank stools yet despite aggressive bowel regimen and
   is not tolerating tube feeds.  High doses of opiates may be
   contributing.  Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction
   on KUB.  Want to encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can
   be restarted and pt. does not suffer nutritionally.
   -          PO narcan to help wake up bowel
   -          Cont. bisacodyl suppository + IV reglan
   -          IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile

He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. 

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. SOB/Resp Failure: The initial presentation could be due to COPD/asthma flare, pneumonia (especially considering aspiration given EtOH abuse), or other pulmonary infections (e.g., TB given homelessness). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary embolism (PE) are less likely. As wheezing has improved, steroids are being decreased. Barriers to extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm, and agitation.

2. Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation has improved, but the patient continues to be hypertensive. EtOH withdrawal and the risk of delirium tremens (DTs) are likely over. The patient was treated with midazolam and valium previously for that. Now on fentanyl for sedation with propofol weaned off. Mental status assessment is challenging due to the mix of drugs currently onboard, but appears improved.

   Assessment and Plan
    64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # Agitation, hypertension, ETOH abuse: Likely due to alcohol
   withdrawal.  Propofol stopped yesterday.  Improved with addition of
   valium, though still requiring 10 mg IV Q4H.  Pt. not absorbing PO meds
   and thus not able to benefit from longer half-life of PO valium.
   Mental status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently
   onboard.  Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing
   though per report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed
   will suppress seizure activity.
   - Weaning Versed
   - D/C valium now that he no longer has signs of withdrawal.
   - Consider repeat EEG if MS improves
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest ?R infiltrate which could
   represent aspiration from event or evolving PNA present prior to IVF.
   Unable to tolerate RSBI in am [**3-15**] agitation.  As wheezing has improved
   dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to extubation
   include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm and agitation.
   - Decrease Solumedrol to 60 mg q12 hours
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Patient did not stool yesterday
   despite aggressive bowel regimen and is not tolerating tube feeds.
   High doses of opiates may be contributing.  Abdomen is currently soft.
   -          KUB to eval for obstruction.
   -          Bisacodyl suppository + IV reglan
   -          IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile
   -          F/U cx nasal drainage, viral swab
   -          Abx if spikes, hold for now
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker until BP controlled, consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. not tolerating TFs.  stop standing IVF and give 1L banana
   bag/day.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was initially suspected to have a COPD exacerbation. The patient left against medical advice (AMA) but later experienced cardiac arrest twice and required bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax.

The patient has several ongoing issues and potential medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Agitation and Hypertension: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, likely due to the cessation of propofol. He is currently on valium, but it may not be absorbed orally. The plan is to wean off versed and discontinue valium now that withdrawal symptoms have improved.

2. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to a combination of drugs currently onboard. There are concerns about possible seizures, but EEG results have been negative so far. It is recommended to repeat the EEG if mental status improves.

3. Respiratory Failure: The initial presentation could be due to various causes such as COPD/asthma flare, pneumonia (especially considering aspiration given EtOH abuse), or other pulmonary infections like tuberculosis (given the patient's homeless status). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is also a possibility. The patient's response to weaning off sedation and the improvement in wheezing suggest a decrease in steroid dosage. The patient is still experiencing"

   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol weaned off.  Mental status difficult to
   assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but appears improved.
   Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing though per
   report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed will suppress
   seizure activity.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out large
   amounts of fluid through OG tube.

   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not explicitly mentioned, but the note mentions several interventions and treatments being administered.

The patient has experienced a bowel movement with the help of medications such as naloxone, docusate, senna, and IV erythromycin. There is also a mention of failed percutaneous shunt (PS) placement, daily banana bag administration, continuation of steroids, and a significant amount of fluid intake and output.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was erythromycin on [**2104-12-13**] at 02:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving propofol and fentanyl infusions, along with other medications like hydralazine, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/88 to 153/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has increased from 79.4 kg at admission to 89 kg currently. The fluid balance shows an intake of 2,774 mL of total fluids, with 883 mL given through the oral route, and an output of 4,265 mL including 915 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 3,295 mL, and there is also NG tube output of 900 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 322, and ventilation rate (Ve) of 9.2 L/min.

Physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not done for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other parameters. Lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is diagnosed with ventricular premature beats (VPBs), constipation, alcohol withdrawal, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, respiratory failure, hypertension, benign pneumothorax, cardiac arrest, and possibly other conditions.

The patient is receiving various ICU care interventions including nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and peripheral intravenous catheterizations, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is not mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, oxygen toxicity, sedation-related complications, delirium, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and nosocomial infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include mental status, alertness, bronchospasm and
   agitation.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg q12 hours
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol weaned off.  Mental status difficult to
   assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but appears improved.
   Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing though per
   report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed will suppress
   seizure activity.
   - Continue fentanyl
   - Consider repeat EEG if MS improves
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   .
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Patient did pass some mucous
   yesterday, but no frank stools yet despite aggressive bowel regimen and
   is not tolerating tube feeds.  High doses of opiates may be
   contributing.  Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction
   on KUB.  Want to encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can
   be restarted and pt. does not suffer nutritionally.
   -          PO narcan to help wake up bowel
   -          Cont. bisacodyl suppository + IV reglan
   -          IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible siunisits. Currently afebrile
   -          F/U cx nasal drainage, viral swab
   -          Abx if spikes, hold for now
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. not tolerating TFs.  1L banana bag/day until TF can be
   started.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath and was later found to have bilateral pneumothorax. He experienced cardiac arrest twice and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently sedated and on a ventilator, with propofol and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 50-94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100-153 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.5°C. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine at 1.27 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. SOB/Resp Failure: The patient initially presented with shortness of breath likely due to a COPD exacerbation or pneumonia. The possibility of aspiration should also be considered given his history of EtOH abuse. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a potential complication in this case. 

2. ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status,
   alertness, and agitation.  Possible infiltrate on CXR, but may be due
   to positioning.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg q12 hours
   - Lasix today to -1 L
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   #Leukocytosis- [**Month (only) 51**] be steroid induced, but may be infectious.  Sources
   include lungs, C. diff, and potentially his sinuses.  No fevers.
   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   -Sputum cx
   -Blood cx x2
   -oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol weaned off.  Mental status difficult to
   assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but appears improved.
   Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing though per
   report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed will suppress
   seizure activity.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out large
   amounts of fluid through OG tube.
   -Clamp suction tubes in order to see
   -Cont. bisacodyl suppository + IV reglan
   -IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, cardiac arrest, and multiple medical conditions. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated on propofol and fentanyl. He has a tracheostomy tube in place, and chest tubes have been inserted for pneumothorax. 

The patient's recent events include bowel movement, improvement in wheezing, and improved mental status. He is still hypertensive and has ongoing fluid losses through the OG tube. His lab results show leukocytosis, hyperlactatemia, elevated potassium, and an abnormal liver function test. The patient has a history of hypertension, for which he was previously prescribed lisinopril and atenolol. 

The patient's current plan includes weaning off sedatives, attempting pressure support ventilation, switching to pressure support mode, decreasing steroids, and starting diuresis. The medical team is also considering restarting tube feeds, sending cultures, and initiating antibiotics if signs of infection arise. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which led to his admission to the ICU. There is a possibility of recurring respiratory failure due to underlying COPD exacerbation or other pulmonary infections.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has had two cardiac arrests and a history of myocardial infarction"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man with severe COPD, ETOH withdrawal, and a history of cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and previous respiratory failure indicate a high risk for further respiratory complications. Monitoring oxygenation, ventilation, and weaning from mechanical ventilation will be crucial.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of bilateral pneumothoraces requiring chest tubes. There is a risk of recurrent pneumothorax or development of tension pneumothorax, which can compromise respiratory function.

3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has experienced cardiac arrest twice, indicating potential cardiac issues. Continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and hemodynamic status is necessary to prevent future cardiac events.

4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is still agitated when waking, suggesting ongoing alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to complications such as delirium tremens, seizures, or worsening agitation. Managing withdrawal symptoms with appropriate medications is essential.

5. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and presence of leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, temperature, and laboratory parameters will help identify and manage any potential infections.

6. Hypervolemia: The patient has an increased fluid balance, indicating possible fluid overload. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status,
   alertness, and agitation.  Possible infiltrate on CXR, but may be due
   to positioning.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg q12 hours
   - Lasix today to -1 L
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   #Leukocytosis- [**Month (only) 51**] be steroid induced, but may be infectious.  Sources
   include lungs, C. diff, and potentially his sinuses.  No fevers.
   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   -Sputum cx
   -Blood cx x2
   -oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol weaned off.  Mental status difficult to
   assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but appears improved.
   Given eye twitching, the patient could possibly be seizing though per
   report EEG yesterday negative for seizures, though versed will suppress
   seizure activity.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out large
   amounts of fluid through OG tube.
   -Clamp suction tubes in order to see
   -Cont. bisacodyl suppository + IV reglan
   -IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. not tolerating TFs.  1L banana bag/day until TF can be

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and homelessness. He presented with shortness of breath and was initially diagnosed with a likely COPD exacerbation. However, he left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced two cardiac arrests. Bilateral chest tubes were placed due to suspected pneumothorax. The patient's current condition includes volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status changes, agitation, and possible sinusitis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, which could be due to a COPD exacerbation, pulmonary infection (such as pneumonia or tuberculosis given his homeless status), or aspiration pneumonia. The recent improvement in wheezing suggests a possible decrease in bronchospasm, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess for any further respiratory issues.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be steroid-induced or infectious. Sources of infection could include the lungs, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and potentially his sinuses. Steroids may be masking infection, so further evaluation is needed. Sputum and blood cultures have been ordered, and the patient is receiving empiric antibiotic therapy.

3. Agitation and EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's agitation improved after treatment with midazolam and valium for possible EtOH withdrawal"

   # Abnormal eye movements: Concerning for possible seizure activity,
   particularly given patient
s initial presentation prior to cardiac
   arrest (tonic-clonic muscle jerks with urinary incontinence).  EEG on
   [**12-9**] negative for seizure activity, however, patient was heavily
   sedated on medications that can suppress seizure activity.  As patient
   had to be reintubated following head CT last night, he was again
   heavily sedated making examination by neurology consultants difficult.
   Appreciate neurology following along.
   - EEG on [**12-15**]; will decrease sedation late this evening in anticipation
   of study tomorrow
   - F/u on neurology recs

   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out small
   amount of fluid through NG tube.
   -attempt tube feeding trial again
   -Cont. bisacodyl suppository + erythromycin
   -IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. previously not tolerating TFs.  Will try again today.  1L
   banana bag/day until TF can be started.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**]; A-line replaced [**12-13**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, and cardiac issues, who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have bilateral pneumothoraces. He underwent bilateral chest tube placement and was intubated. The patient experienced two cardiac arrests, one during the placement of chest tubes and another during a cooling protocol. He was successfully resuscitated both times. The patient's mental status has been altered due to heavy sedation for most of his ICU stay, making neurological examination challenging. An EEG was negative for seizure activity, but it is planned to repeat the EEG once sedation is decreased. The patient has shown improvement in his agitation, but still requires sedation. He has a history of hypertension and was previously on lisinopril and atenolol. His blood pressure remains elevated, and enalapril is being continued as he cannot tolerate oral medications. The patient had poor intestinal absorption/motility initially but has shown improvement, and efforts are being made to restart tube feeds. He also has a history of alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, propofol, enalapril, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, haloperidol, and lasix. He has had multiple cultures taken including blood, sputum, and stool. Further investigations such as an arterial blood gas (ABG), chest X-ray, and head CT have been done. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe COPD and ETOH withdrawal. He experienced respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient had an episode of ocular clonus to the left and self-extubated during a stat head CT. He was reintubated and has been heavily sedated since. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, benign pneumothorax, cardiac arrest, and ileus. He also has a history of respiratory failure, chronic hypertension, and other conditions not mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient had a seizure overnight, and it is unclear if anoxic brain injury from previous codes is playing a role.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: There is doubt that the patient's seizure was due to alcohol withdrawal.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient has severe COPD with acute exacerbation, which may require continued nebs on steroid taper.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of chronic hypertension, which should be monitored closely.
5. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of benign pneumothorax, which could potentially complicate his respiratory status.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, indicating a risk for future cardiac events.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # Abnormal eye movements: Concerning for possible seizure activity,
   particularly given patient
s initial presentation prior to cardiac
   arrest (tonic-clonic muscle jerks with urinary incontinence).  EEG on
   [**12-9**] negative for seizure activity, however, patient was heavily
   sedated on medications that can suppress seizure activity.  As patient
   had to be reintubated following head CT last night, he was again
   heavily sedated making examination by neurology consultants difficult.
   Appreciate neurology following along.
   - EEG on [**12-15**]; will decrease sedation late this evening in anticipation
   of study tomorrow
   - F/u on neurology recs
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status,
   alertness, and agitation.  Possible infiltrate on CXR, but may be due
   to positioning.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg daily
   - Lasix today to -1 L
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   #Leukocytosis- [**Month (only) 51**] be steroid induced, but may be infectious.  Sources
   include lungs, C. diff, and potentially his sinuses.  No fevers.
   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   -Sputum cx
   -Blood cx x2
   -oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol back on (previously weaned off).  Mental
   status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but
   appears improved.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out small
   amount of fluid through NG tube.
   -attempt tube feeding trial again
   -Cont. bisacodyl suppository + erythromycin
   -IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. He presented with shortness of breath and was initially treated for a likely COPD exacerbation. However, he left against medical advice and later experienced cardiac arrest twice. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Bilateral chest tubes were inserted for pneumothorax, which is now sealed to vacuum. The patient has been sedated heavily due to agitation and possible EtOH withdrawal, but his mental status has improved. He has a history of hypertension and was previously on lisinopril and atenolol. His blood pressure remains elevated. The patient also has poor intestinal absorption/motility, and efforts are being made to encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted. He has hyperlactatemia, possibly due to hypoperfusion or respiratory distress. His head CT shows fluid in the sinuses, indicating possible sinusitis. The patient had a silent myocardial infarction and requires further cardiac evaluation. He has a history of alcoholic hepatitis and PTSD/bipolar disorder. The patient's family members have been informed, and guardianship paperwork is in progress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be steroid-induced or due to an infection. Sources of infection include the lungs, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and potentially his"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # Abnormal eye movements: Concerning for possible seizure activity,
   particularly given patient
s initial presentation prior to cardiac
   arrest (tonic-clonic muscle jerks with urinary incontinence).  EEG on
   [**12-9**] negative for seizure activity, however, patient was heavily
   sedated on medications that can suppress seizure activity.  As patient
   had to be reintubated following head CT last night, he was again
   heavily sedated making examination by neurology consultants difficult.
   Appreciate neurology following along.
   - EEG on [**12-15**]; will decrease sedation late this evening in anticipation
   of study tomorrow
   - F/u on neurology recs
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status,
   alertness, and agitation.  Possible infiltrate on CXR, but may be due
   to positioning.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg daily
   - Lasix today to -1 L
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   #Leukocytosis- [**Month (only) 51**] be steroid induced, but may be infectious.  Sources
   include lungs, C. diff, and potentially his sinuses.  No fevers.
   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   -Sputum cx
   -Blood cx x2
   -oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol back on (previously weaned off).  Mental
   status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but
   appears improved.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out small
   amount of fluid through NG tube.
   -attempt tube feeding trial again
   -Cont. bisacodyl suppository + erythromycin
   -IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider antibiotics if pt demonstrates s/s of infection.
   # ?Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. previously not tolerating TFs.  Now restarting tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, and EtOH abuse. He initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, and left against medical advice. Subsequently, he experienced cardiac arrest twice and required bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and sedated. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including agitation, hypertension, poor intestinal absorption/motility, hyperlactatemia, possible sinusitis, CAD with silent myocardial infarction, PTSD/bipolar disorder, and a history of alcoholic hepatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient's initial presentation included tonic-clonic muscle jerks with urinary incontinence, which could suggest seizure activity. However, a subsequent EEG was negative for seizure activity, possibly due to heavy sedation. Another EEG is planned once sedation is decreased.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Barriers to extubation include volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status changes, and agitation.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be steroid-induced but could also be infectious. Sources of infection include the lungs, Clostridium difficile, and potentially sinuses."

","Summary:
The patient, a 6-16 year old with unknown last name, is currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pneumothorax, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, seizure, ventricular premature beats (VPB), constipation, alcohol withdrawal, and hypertension. The patient is on various medications including captopril, furosemide, pantoprazole, haloperidol, and heparin sodium. They are also receiving IV fluids and have an arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to a history of respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient's lung function deteriorates further.
2. Ventricular Premature Beats (VPB): The presence of VPB indicates abnormal heart rhythm, which may lead to arrhythmias or other cardiac complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Pt currently extubated and respiratory status
   appears stable for now.  Has forced expiration with prolonged
   expiratory phase.  Chest tubes to suction.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg daily
   - Lasix today to -500 to -1 L
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs q2hours
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, will discuss with thoracic
   surgery regarding further management
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX
   .
   #Positive Blood cultures: Will await sensitivies but start Vancomycin
   imperically given ICU setting and lines.
   - check peripheral and PICC line cultures
   - pull A-line today
   - start Vancomycin until sensitivities return
   - echo today to assess valves
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: occasionally hypertensive and agitated. Likely
   had anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac arrest.
   - Haldol for agitation
   - check ECG for prolonged QTC
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Captopril 6.25 TID, Haldol for agitation
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility:  Having intermittent bowel
   movements.  Changed bowel regimen to PRN oral.
   -attempt tube feeding trial again
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   - F/U neuro recs
   .
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - add ASA
   - hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. previously not tolerating TFs.  Now restarting tube feeds.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**]; A-line replaced [**12-13**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC tid, VAP bundle, bowel regimen, H2 blocker
   # Code:  FULL presumed
   # Dispo:  MICU

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath and likely had a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and was later found to have experienced two cardiac arrests with bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient is currently extubated and in the ICU. His vital signs show hypertension and agitation, for which he received IV Haldol. He has been started on PO medications and is being weaned off sedation. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which he was previously discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. He also has a history of EtOH abuse and alcoholic hepatitis. There is a mention of PTSD and bipolar disorder, but it seems he is not currently on any medications for these conditions. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hyperkalemia and acidosis. His cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are within normal limits. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient has had multiple interventions including chest tube placement, cardiac arrest management, and medication changes. He is currently on several medications including Lasix, Protonix, Haldol, and captopril.

   sedated on medications that can suppress seizure activity.  As patient
   had to be reintubated following head CT last night, he was again
   heavily sedated making examination by neurology consultants difficult.
   Appreciate neurology following along.
   - EEG on [**12-15**]; will decrease sedation late this evening in anticipation
   of study tomorrow
   - F/u on neurology recs
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Multiple possible etiologies for initial
   presentation including COPD/asthma flare, PNA (especially consider
   aspiration given EtOH) or other pulmonary infections (e.g. TB given
   homeless).  ACS (ECG supports prior inferior MI and risk factors
   include male, smoker) or PE less likely given presentation.  Initial
   CXR without acute process but now s/p arrest.   As wheezing has
   improved dramatically will start to decrease steroids.  Barriers to
   extubation include volume overload, bronchospasm, mental status,
   alertness, and agitation.  Possible infiltrate on CXR, but may be due
   to positioning.
   - Will try to switch to pressure support today.
   - Cont.  Solumedrol to 60 mg daily
   - Lasix today to -1 L
   - Continue Atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue chest tubes for pneumothorax, currently sealed to vacuum.
   - Follow ABGs and lactate
   - Daily CXRs to assess CTs, PTX

   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   -Sputum cx
   -Blood cx x2
   -oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol back on (previously weaned off).  Mental
   status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but
   appears improved.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   #. Poor intestinal absorption/motility: Pt had first small bowel
   movement yesterday.  High doses of opiates may be contributing.
   Abdomen is currently soft.  No evidence of obstruction on KUB.  Want to
   encourage intestinal motility so that tube feeds can be restarted and
   pt. does not suffer nutritionally.  Pt currently putting out small
   amount of fluid through NG tube.
   -attempt tube feeding trial again
   -Cont. bisacodyl suppository + erythromycin
   -IV banana bag + PR aspirin / day
   -Abdominal exams for distention/rigidity.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Hyperlactatemia: Elevated lactate on first admission with AG 13 and
   elevated bicarb. Bicarb likely elevated [**3-15**] acute/chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Lactate may be elevated [**3-15**] hypoperfusion, increased work of
   breathing with respiratory distress. No signs or symptoms of sepsis.
   - f/u cultures

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and homelessness. He initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB), likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice (AMA). The patient later experienced two cardiac arrests, with bilateral chest tube placements for pneumothorax. He is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 161/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals subcutaneous crepitus throughout the upper chest, decreasing coarse vented breath sounds bilaterally, and pitting edema in the hands and lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's blood cultures have been drawn, and he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin). He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium.

The patient's assessment and plan include several concerns:

1. Abnormal eye movements: There is a concern for possible seizure activity, especially considering the patient's initial presentation with tonic-cl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and previous cardiac arrest. He presented initially with shortness of breath and was found to have bilateral pneumothoraces. He was intubated and received multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine during resuscitation. He experienced a second cardiac arrest during the cooling protocol. The patient has been sedated since then and has shown minimal reaction. His neurologic examination is within normal limits, but he is still sedated. He has fluid in his sinuses on head CT and purulent drainage from the left nostril, indicating possible sinusitis. The patient also has leukocytosis, which may be steroid-induced or infectious. He has a history of alcoholic hepatitis, PTSD/bipolar disorder, and CAD with a silent myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and purulent nasal drainage, suggesting a possible infection. Regular monitoring of vital signs, WBC count, and sputum culture is important to detect and treat any infection promptly.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating fluid overload. Monitoring intake and output, along with daily weights, can help manage fluid status and prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently hypertensive. It is important to monitor blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CT placement for PTX.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Cont. 40mg PO prednisone.
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Lasix today to -1 L again today.
   - Consider the use of heliox if upper airway sounds and respiratory
   difficulties persist.
   - Contact [**Name (NI) **] team re: remaining chest tube that can likely be
   pulled.
   .
   #Leukocytosis - [**Month (only) 51**] be steroid induced, but may be infectious.  Sources
   include lungs, C. diff, and potentially his sinuses.  No fevers.
   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   - F/u sputum cx, blood cx x2
   - Discontinued the Vanc, as positive blood cultures were likely
   contaminant from A-line, and no other surveillance cultures have been
   positive since then.
   - Oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Mental
   status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to investigate
   AMS further.
   - MRI of neck and brain.
   - Zyprexa now changed to 50mg TID.
   - Trial Ativan for agitation, may be of use when transporting and
   during MRI of neck and brain.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   - STOP continuous nebulizers.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 will complete paperwork today.
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia,
   - Consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Attempt to diurese
   another 0.5 to 1L. Replete electrolytes PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC tid, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice, resulting in bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax.

Currently, the patient is extubated and protecting his own airway, although he has relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. The patient's neurological examination indicates sedation, negative doll's eyes, spontaneous movements of the lower extremities, and opening his eyes to noxious stimuli.

Laboratory results reveal leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies show listhesis at C5-C6, a chipped-off spur of calcified posterior ligament at C2, and some hypodensity in the lower pons area.

The patient's medical conditions include SOB/Respiratory Failure, Leukocytosis, Agitation/Mental Status Changes, Hypertension, and S/P Cardiac Arrest. He also has a history of COPD, EtOH abuse, and sinusitis.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory distress due to airway obstruction, infection (such as pneumonia or sinusitis), further cardiac issues, and complications related to"

   24 Hour Events:
   CT of Head and Spine:
   CT C spine shows few mm of listhesis C5, C6. At C2, bridging ""spur"" of
   calcified posterior ligament has been chipped off and may be
   compressing  the cord anteriorly.   CT head shows no watershed
   infarcts, but at level of lower pons there is some R lateral
   hypodensity - this may be from beam hardening but alternatively could
   be relevant, i.e. stroke.
   Neuro recommends hard collar, MRI of spine and head, however pt unable
   to lie flat for MRI
   [** 3297**]: First CT pulled this morning with CXR ordered.  If no
   pneumothoras from the removal of the first chest tube, the second will
   be removed.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with shortness of breath and likely COPD exacerbation. He had bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. Although he is now successfully extubated and protecting his own airway, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and potential complications such as pneumonia or further pneumothorax.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be steroid-induced or infectious. Possible sources of infection include the lungs, C. diff, and potentially his sinuses. The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, especially considering his prolonged ICU stay.

3. Agitation and ETOH abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and displayed agitation. While his agitation has improved, there is still a risk of EtOH withdrawal and risk of delirium tremens (DTs). Close monitoring and appropriate treatment with benzodiazepines may be required.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and requires medication for this condition. His current hypertension needs to be managed appropriately to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.

5. S/P cardiac arrest: The patient has had two cardiac arrests, with multiple etiologies including pneumothorax, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and possible seizure. He received multiple rounds"

   CT of Head and Spine:
   CT C spine shows few mm of listhesis C5C6. At C2, bridging ""spur"" of
   calcified posterior ligament has been chipped off and may displace the
   cord anteriorly.
   CT head shows no watershed infarcts, but at level of lower pons there
   is some R lateral hypodensity - this may be from beam hardening but
   alternatively could be relevant, i.e. stroke.

   However, steroids may be masking infection.
   - F/u sputum cx, blood cx x2
   - Oxymetazoline per nares and saline washes for sinusitis
   # Agitation, ETOH abuse: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Was
   treated with midazolam and valium previously for that.  Now on fentanyl
   for sedation with propofol back on (previously weaned off).  Mental
   status difficult to assess given mix of drugs currently onboard, but
   appears improved.
   - Begin attempting to wean sedation in order to move towards PSV.
   - Haldol for agitation
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Cont. enalapril IV as pt. cannot yet tolerate PO meds
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Wean fentanyl and versed gtt as tolerated
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. He presented initially with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice (AMA). He subsequently experienced cardiac arrest twice and underwent bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient is currently extubated and able to protect his own airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and asthma, which puts him at risk for respiratory failure. His current condition shows improvement, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be due to infection or steroid-induced. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and requires medication for this condition. His current blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive therapy should be continued.

4. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and his agitation may be related to EtOH withdrawal. Close monitoring and sedation management are necessary to prevent complications such as delirium tremens.

5. S/P Cardiac Arrest: The patient has experienced two cardiac arrests, possibly due to various etiologies including pneumothorax, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and seizures. The patient is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and homelessness. He initially presented with shortness of breath and was left AMA. He subsequently experienced cardiac arrest twice and required bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient has been intubated and sedated, but is now successfully extubated and protecting his airway. He has uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds. His vital signs are stable, and he is receiving various medications for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory difficulties may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed. This is indicated by his uncoordinated respiratory movements and obstructive sounds in the upper airway.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be steroid-induced or infectious. Sources of infection include the lungs, C. diff, and potentially the sinuses. It is important to follow up with sputum and blood cultures to identify any potential infections.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and requires medication to manage his blood pressure. Enalapril IV is being continued, and the use of beta-blockers may be considered once the patient can tolerate oral medications.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and confusion. EtOH withdrawal and the risk of delir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, and other medical conditions. He presented initially with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, and left against medical advice. He subsequently experienced two cardiac arrests and required chest tube insertion for pneumothorax. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but is now successfully extubated and able to protect his airway. However, he has uncoordinated respiratory movements and obstructive sounds in the upper airway. His mental status is improving, but he remains hypertensive and agitated. The patient has leukocytosis, possibly steroid-induced, and a positive blood culture that is likely contamination. His hypertension is managed with enalapril IV and consideration of switching to oral medications. The patient's medical decision-making is being pursued with the family, and guardianship paperwork is in progress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cord injury: There is uncertainty regarding whether the patient has cervical cord compression based on imaging. The patient cannot lie flat for an MRI scanner and is currently wearing a cervical collar. Consulting a spine specialist and neurologist would be important to determine the extent of potential cord injury.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with shortness of breath and had a likely COPD exacerbation. Although he has been successfully extubated, he still experiences uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   #  ?Cord injury: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on imaging.  Patient cannot lie flat for MRI
   scanner.  Is currently wearing a c-collar.
   - neuro following
   - per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar, MRI when able
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.  Nebs somewhat helpful.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Will increase Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - hold on diuresis today with goal to keep even
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**3-15**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.
   - start Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and
   PICC.  Will consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Mental
   status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to investigate
   AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt currently
   becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.  This is likely from
   underlying anoxic brain injury.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Attempt to diurese
   another 0.5 to 1L, but will only give lasix once today due to increase
   in creatinine overnight. Replete electrolytes PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC tid, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status. On PPI

   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 64M COPD flare, arrest x2 due to tension PTX
   s/p bilateral CT placement. Now extubated. Mental status remains
   variable but generally drowsy, following some commands but speaking in
   single words and tracking to voice. Awaiting MRI, orthospine following
   for concern of cervical cord lesion.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.8  99.3 BP 80/39-182/104 RR 17  with sat 98
   on 35% FM   WD M, following simple commands. Poor air mvoement with
   long expiratory phase and UA wheeze on expiration. Distant HS.
   Distended abd, + BS, NT. trace dep edema with 2+ distal pulses. Labs
   notable for WBC 9.6 K, K+ 3.5, Cr 1.0. BCx [**12-15**] + CNS blood x1, [**12-16**]
   ngtd, [**12-17**] CNS; no new imaging
   Agree with plan to continue PO steroids
increase pred dose to 60 and
   continue nebs PRN for COPD flare as he remains with exp wheeze. Hold on
   diuresis, given cr bump (now back to baseline) with stable urine
   output.  Given concern for cervical cord lesion, ortho spine consulted,
   and awaiting further imaging with MRI.  This will be high risk given
   his lung disease and mental status at this time. Continue hard collar
   for now. For GPC in blood, now recurrent, will repeat surveillance cxs
   off peripiheral site.  Restart empiric vanco though may be
   contaminent.  Continue picc for now as remains AF with no
   leukocytosis.  If repeat cx return pos will d/c picc. Encephalopathy is
   multifactorial, will follow serial exams and limit psychotropic meds
   except seroquel and low dose ativan PRN. BP remains suboptimally
   controlled--titrate ace-i and treat agitation. Guardianship paperwork
   underway. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   #  ?Cord injury: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on imaging.  Patient cannot lie flat for MRI
   scanner.  Is currently wearing a c-collar.
   - neuro following
   - per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar, MRI when able
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.  Nebs somewhat helpful.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Will increase Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - hold on diuresis today with goal to keep even
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**3-15**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.
   - start Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and
   PICC.  Will consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Mental
   status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to investigate
   AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt currently
   becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.  This is likely from
   underlying anoxic brain injury.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Attempt to diurese
   another 0.5 to 1L, but will only give lasix once today due to increase
   in creatinine overnight. Replete electrolytes PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC tid, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status. On PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath and likely had a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice, with bilateral chest tubes removed for pneumothorax. He was successfully extubated but suffered from neurologic impairment with suspected spinal cord compression.

- The patient has positive blood cultures with coag-negative Staph from the PICC line, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. He has been started on vancomycin, and repeat cultures have been taken.

- The patient is hypertensive and tachycardic at times, showing signs of agitation and mental status changes. This may be due to underlying anoxic brain injury or EtOH withdrawal.

- The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still has uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds. Nebulizers have been somewhat helpful.

- His WBC count is trending down, indicating improvement in the infection.

- The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine levels. Lasix has been held due to this.

- The patient's electrolytes are relatively normal, but magnesium levels are low.

- The patient's history of hypertension and previous discharge on lisinopril and atenolol indicates that he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. He initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice. He later experienced cardiac arrest twice and was successfully resuscitated both times. Bilateral chest tubes were inserted for pneumothorax, and the patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia following the second cardiac arrest. He remains sedated but shows signs of improved mental status. The patient has been extubated and is protecting his own airway, although he has uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds. He is hypertensive and at risk for ethanol withdrawal and delirium tremens. His blood cultures show contamination, and his leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to steroid use. The patient also has a history of hypertension and was previously discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. He requires ongoing medical management for various conditions, including COPD exacerbation, potential cord injury, respiratory failure, agitation, mental status changes, hypertension, leukocytosis, sinusitis, post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and possible PTSD/bipolar disorder. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is tolerating tube feeds."

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   #  ?Cord injury: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on imaging.  Patient cannot lie flat for MRI
   scanner.  Is currently wearing a soft c-collar.
   - neuro following
   - per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar, MRI when able.
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.  Nebs somewhat helpful.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Will increase Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - hold on diuresis today with goal to keep even
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**3-15**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.
   - start Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and
   PICC.  Will consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Mental
   status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to investigate
   AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt currently
   becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.  This is likely from
   underlying anoxic brain injury.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Attempt to diurese
   another 0.5 to 1L, but will only give lasix once today due to increase
   in creatinine overnight. Replete electrolytes PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC tid, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status. On PPI
   # Code:  FULL presumed
   # Dispo:  MICU
   # Communication:  Spoke with brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2269**] (Cell [**0-0-**])
   and updated. Closest family member is oldest son [**Name (NI) 3062**].  [**Name2 (NI) 3062**] and
   [**Doctor Last Name **] both in [**Location (un) 3063**].  Social work spoke with [**Doctor Last Name 3062**] who would like to
   make medical decisions and pursue guardianship if necessary.  (see SW
   note).  Guardianship paperwork in progress.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # Cord injury?: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on imaging.  Patient cannot lie flat for MRI
   scanner.  Is currently wearing a soft c-collar.
   - Neuro following
   - Per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar
   - MRI when able.
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.  Nebs somewhat helpful.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Will increase Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Hold on diuresis today with goal to keep even, and perhaps small
   amounts of IVF.
   - Heliox trial in an attempt to reduce upper airway resistance.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**3-15**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.
   - start Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and
   PICC.  Will consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
   - Will follow pending cultures; if negative, will stop and strip
   Vancomycin.
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   intermittently hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely
   over.  Mental status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to
   investigate AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt
   currently becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   - PRN Morphine.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile.
   - See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Will consider small
   amounts of diamox to correct metabolic alkolosis.  Replete electrolytes
   PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status; On PPI

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and previous cardiac arrest. He presented with shortness of breath and was initially suspected to have a COPD exacerbation. However, the patient left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced another cardiac arrest with bilateral chest tubes removed for pneumothorax (PTX). He was successfully extubated but suffered from neurologic impairment, potentially due to spinal cord compression.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are as follows:

1. Spinal cord compression: The patient may experience worsening neurological symptoms such as paralysis or loss of sensation in the lower extremities if decompression surgery is not performed promptly.

2. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory distress, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.

3. Infection: The presence of positive blood cultures with coag-negative staphylococcus indicates a potential bloodstream infection. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with multiple antihypertensive medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.

5. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's history of EtOH abuse, there is a risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   #  ?Cord injury: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on imaging.  Patient cannot lie flat for MRI
   scanner.  Is currently wearing a soft c-collar.
   - neuro following
   - per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar, MRI when able.
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.  Nebs somewhat helpful.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Will increase Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - hold on diuresis today with goal to keep even
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**3-15**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.
   - start Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and
   PICC.  Will consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely over.  Mental
   status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to investigate
   AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt currently
   becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.  This is likely from
   underlying anoxic brain injury.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile
   -          See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN: Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Attempt to diurese
   another 0.5 to 1L, but will only give lasix once today due to increase
   in creatinine overnight. Replete electrolytes PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC tid, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status. On PPI
   # Code:  FULL presumed
   # Dispo:  MICU
   # Communication:  Spoke with brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2269**] (Cell [**0-0-**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient left against medical advice (AMA) but later returned after experiencing cardiac arrest twice. Bilateral chest tubes were inserted due to pneumothorax. The patient was intubated and suffered from neurologic impairment with suspected spinal cord compression.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note are as follows:

1. Cord injury: The patient may have a cervical cord compression based on imaging. The patient cannot lie flat for an MRI scanner, and a soft collar has been placed. Neurological follow-up is recommended.

2. SOB/Resp Failure: The patient successfully extubated but still exhibits uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds. Nebulizers have been somewhat helpful. Trend WBC count, fever curve, and increasing Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment are being considered. Atrovent and albuterol nebs will continue, and diuresis will be held for now.

3. Positive Blood Cultures with Coag-negative Staph: The patient has positive blood cultures with coag-negative staph from the PICC line. Vancomycin has been started, and repeat cultures from peripheral and PICC lines will be done. Consider"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # Cord injury?: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on imaging.  Patient cannot lie flat for MRI
   scanner.  Is currently wearing a soft c-collar.
   - Neuro following
   - Per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar
   - MRI when able.
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Now successfully extubated and protecting his own
   airway, though does have relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements
   and upper airway obstructive sounds.  Nebs somewhat helpful.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Will increase Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Hold on diuresis today with goal to keep even, and perhaps small
   amounts of IVF.
   - Heliox trial in an attempt to reduce upper airway resistance.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**3-15**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.
   - start Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and
   PICC.  Will consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
   - Will follow pending cultures; if negative, will stop and strip
   Vancomycin.
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   intermittently hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely
   over.  Mental status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to
   investigate AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt
   currently becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   - PRN Morphine.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile.
   - See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Will consider small
   amounts of diamox to correct metabolic alkolosis.  Replete electrolytes
   PRN.
   # Access:  PICC line placed [**12-8**].
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status; On PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old homeless male with a history of COPD, asthma, and EtOH abuse. He presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice. He later experienced cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothorax. The patient is currently extubated but suffering from neurologic impairment, possibly due to spinal cord compression. 

The patient has positive blood cultures growing coag-negative Staphylococcus, which may be related to a PICC line infection. He is receiving vancomycin for this infection. The patient also has agitation and mental status changes, which may be attributed to EtOH withdrawal and delirium tremens. 

The patient has hypertension, which was previously managed with lisinopril and atenolol. He is currently hypertensive and tachycardic. 

The patient has a history of alcoholic hepatitis, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and coronary artery disease with a recent silent myocardial infarction. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing respiratory distress. His blood work shows leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient is tolerating tube feeds well and is replete with electrolytes. He has a PICC line in place. 

Medical decisions are being made in consultation with the family, and guardianship paperwork is in progress."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and homelessness. He initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, and left against medical advice. The patient subsequently experienced two cardiac arrests with bilateral chest tubes removed for pneumothorax. He was successfully extubated and is currently suffering from neurologic impairment with possible spinal cord compression. 

The patient has positive blood cultures growing coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is sensitive to vancomycin. He is receiving vancomycin and other ICU medications. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he has been intermittently hypertensive and tachycardic. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which he was previously discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. He also has a history of alcoholic hepatitis, PTSD/bipolar disorder, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's current medications include captopril for hypertension, seroquel for agitation, ativan for agitation, and continuing abxs for suspected infection. He is also receiving supportive care post-cardiac arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurologic impairment: The patient's neurologic impairment may worsen due to possible spinal cord compression.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures growing coag-negative Staphylococcus, which requires continued treatment with vancomycin and monitoring for"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with history of COPD now s/p arrest with bilateral
   pneumothorax and now with evidence of persistent bacteremia and altered
   mental status slow to improve.
   -COPD with Acute Exacerbation-
   Treatment is to be with
   -Prednisone to continue
   -Atrovent nebs to continue standing and PRN
   -CXR this morning with ABG to conitinue
   -Add Zopinex
   -Needs [**Hospital1 **]-Level support to allow facilitation of ventilation and
   enhance expiratory time to allow minimization of dynamic
   hyperinflation.
   -BIPAP in 2 hour trials to continue
   Bacteremia-Persisent positive blood cultures
   -Vanco
   -Possible sources are central cardiac source of possible embolic
   phenomenon
   -ECHO today
   -Consider more CNS imaging
   -Line change required and would favor peripheral IV
s and will place
   central line if needed
   -Epidural Abscess is raised as a possibility given findings on CT scan
   and concerning positive cultures and would favor MRI scan should
   alternative sources not be clearly seen and with persistent abnormal
   exam will have to consider MRI today but would require intubation.
   Cord Compression-
   -See above for concern for Epidural Abscess but has not been raised as
   issue to date but must be considered in the setting of persistent
   bacteremia

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD who experienced a cardiac arrest and bilateral pneumothorax. He currently has persistent bacteremia, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient also has several other medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, hypertension, altered nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, seizure, ventricular premature beats, constipation, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple central lines in place, which increases the risk of developing a bloodstream infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots, leading to DVT and potentially life-threatening PE.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) or wound infections.

5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium, especially considering the presence of multiple comorbidities and medications.

6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # Cord injury?: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on CT imaging.  Patient could not lie flat for
   MRI scanner without sedation and was placed in a soft c-collar per
   ortho spine recs.  Due to concern for possible epidural abscess in the
   setting of fevers, abnormal neurologic exam, and possible cord lesion
   patient was reintubated on [**12-22**] to have definitive imaging.
   Preliminarily no evidence of epidural abscess or cord compression on
   MRI.
   - F/u final neck & brain MRI reads
   - Neuro following
   - Per ortho spine, no indication for spinal decompression surgery, can
   change to soft collar
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He did have
   relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements this morning as he has
   in the past.  Continuing nebs & seroquel.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Cont. Prednisone to 60mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs and xopenex nebs to avoid tachycardia and
   increased agitation
   - Diuresis today with 20 IV Lasix.
   - SBT this morning with goal to extubated this afternoon if pt.
   tolerating attempt to wean from vent.
   - BiPAP or Heliox trial in an attempt to reduce upper airway
   resistance.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: from PICC line on
   [**2104-12-17**], Coag negative staph in [**4-14**] bottles.  Had Coag neg staph from
   cultures [**2104-12-15**].  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.  No
   vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for now and repeat cultures from peripheral and PICC
   on [**12-22**].
   - Requested repeat sensitivities on blood culture from [**2104-12-20**]
   - PIV placed yesterday; will remove PICC today
   .
   # PEG placement: Will discuss with general surgery today.  Consent to
   be obtained from patient
s son who is pursuing guardianship.
   .
   # Acute HCT drop: [**Month (only) 51**] be related to receiving IVF last night to support
   BP after sedation for intubation.  Will recheck stat hct and further
   pursue if truly low (stool guaiacs, hemolysis labs).
   .
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   intermittently hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely
   over.  Mental status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to
   investigate AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt
   currently becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   - PRN Morphine.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) but later returned after experiencing cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothorax. He was extubated but suffered from neurologic impairment with possible spinal cord compression. He was reintubated to have an MRI, which showed no evidence of epidural abscess or cord compression. 

The patient is currently suffering from agitation, mental status changes, hypertension, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. He has positive blood cultures with coag-negative staph from the PICC line. He has a history of hypertension and was previously discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. 

The patient's medical decision-making includes pursuing conversations with the family, pursuing guardianship paperwork, and discussing PEG placement with general surgery. 

The patient's current medications include propofol, lorazepam, heparin sodium, glargine, humalog, atrovent nebs, xopenex nebs, seroquel, captopril, and ASA. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated potassium levels. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 78"

1. SOB/Resp Failure: He is now successfully extubated and protecting his own airway, although he has relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements and upper airway obstructive sounds. Nebulizers and seroquel have been somewhat helpful.
2. Positive Blood Cultures with Coag-negative staph: He had coag-negative staph from PICC line cultures on [**2104-12-17**], and coag-negative staph in [**4-14**] bottles. He also had coag-negative staph from cultures on [**2104-12-15**]. He is currently afebrile, and WBCs are trending down. He will continue to receive vancomycin, and repeat cultures from peripheral and PICC will be done. Consider stopping abxs if follow-up cxs come back negative.
3. Agitation, mental status: His agitation has improved, but he continues to be intermittently hypertensive. EtOH withdrawal and the risk of DTs are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure, complicated by cardiac arrest and bilateral pneumothorax. He also has concerning findings of persistent positive cultures and spine level lesions. The patient has undergone an MRI to evaluate for the nature of possible CNS insult or para-spinal collection. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown good tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning to 5/5. He responds well to verbal prompts and is able to respond to commands with limited compliance but regular response. The plan includes performing a spontaneous breathing test (SBT), moving to extubation, using intermittent bipap as needed, and administering Atrovent, Prednisone, and a bronchodilator.
2) Spinal Ligament Lesion: The MRI did not show evidence of epidural abscess or CNS lesion, which is reassuring. The plan includes continuing with a soft collar, following up with final imaging, and seeking neurologic follow-up in light of MRI findings.
3) Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is being monitored, and he remains on antibiotics. No new cultures have been positive to date.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function should continue to be closely monitored, and any signs of deterioration should be addressed promptly.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male admit initially with exacerbation of COPD now with hospital
   course complicated by recurrent respiratory failure and bactermia.  He
   has MRI performed to evaluate for possible para-spinal collection and
   prelim that is not seen but final read is pending.  Catheter related
   blood stream infection has been raised as a concern for persistent
   fever and bacteremia.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient has clear persistent increased resistance attributable to his
   underlying chronic obstructive lung disease.  With quiet respiration
   patient has some increased resistance but is able to maintain a
   reasonable minute ventilation with only minimal dynamic
   hyperinflation.  It would appear that in the setting of tachypnea
   patient has dynamic hyperinflation and subsequent hypercarbic
   respiratory compromise.
   -Both airflows obstruction and agitation do have to be managed.
   -Will move to PSV wean today
   -Would need to have sedation in place to the point of stable
   respiration but responsiveness prior to extubation
   -Wean prednisone to 40mg today
   -Continue bronchodilators
   2)Bactermia-
   -Follow up with MRI final [**Location (un) **]

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. The patient has been in the ICU and has a history of COPD exacerbation, recurrent respiratory failure, and bacteremia. The patient's current vital signs show tachypnea, normal blood pressure, sinus rhythm, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes and diminished breath sounds. The lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The assessment and plan include management of respiratory failure, bacteremia, anemia, and other medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential infections related to the PICC line.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening respiratory failure, bacteremia, or development of new complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He also has a history of hypertension, anxiety, and altered mental status. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood cultures from the catheter tip showed growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus, leading to the decision to withhold surgery for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's vitals have been stable, with a heart rate between 79-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 70-137 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's neurological status has improved, with the ability to open eyes to noxious stimuli and answer some questions. The patient's respiratory support has been weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10 cmH2O, and the endotracheal tube has been changed. The patient's sedation was increased with zyprexa and seroquel due to agitation and diaphoresis. The patient's fluid balance has been within goal, with a total fluid intake of 1720 mL and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and hypertension. The patient's sputum culture showed coag-negative staph, which led to the discontinuation of PEG due to positive BCx and catheter tip culture. The patient received Zyprexa for agitation and was placed on increased standing dose. Vent weaning was attempted but resulted in diaphoresis and tachypnea, so the patient was changed back to AC and VS improved. The patient is currently on PSV 10/5 mode. Labile BPs were observed with agitation, and the patient was given seroquel and ativan. Diuresis of -900cc was achieved, meeting the goal. Neuro recs include EEG, B12, EMG, and consideration of LP at some point. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/51 to 215/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 70 kg, and height is 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,720 mL and output of 2,580 mL. Respir"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  Was not able to
   be extubated yesterday due to respiratory distress during SBTs.
   Continues to look poorly from a respiratory standpoint despite
   appearing adequately sedated with seroquel.   It is likely his
   underlying lung disease that is keeping him from being extubated at
   this point.  Previously his COPD has been steroid responsive.  Patient
   is 11+ 3 days total of intubation currently.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Increase prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Chest CT to further evaluate lungs and r/o other processes (e.g,
   mycetoma given high dose steroid treatment)
   - Reassess respiratory status this evening to consider SBT again
   tomorrow.
   - Consider BiPAP or Heliox trial once extubated.
   .
   # Cord injury?: MRI scan shows no evidence of epidural abscess or cord
   compression.  There is some cervical spine stenosis at C2-C3 and
   C3-C4.
   - Will discuss MRI results w/ ortho spine to check if okay to clear
   from soft collar
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Reason for altered mental status and
   unresponsiveness remains unclear.  MRI of brain without evidence of
   significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical illness and multiple
   medications that he has received.  Neurology is following.  B12 level
   normal.
   - EMG & repeat EEG studies ordered and pending
   - continue seroquel 25 mg PO TID and 25 mg prn agitation.
   - continue ativan and propofol.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], and [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles).    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**],
   no growth yet on [**2-13**] from [**12-20**] or from [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] blood cultures.
   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed
   [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.  Unclear if one or more of these
   represent contamination.  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending
   down.  No vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for 14 day course (start [**12-22**] to end [**1-5**]) and
   continue to check surveillance cultures.
   .
   # PEG placement: Discussed with general surgery.  They are willing to
   place after patient has multiple negative blood cultures while on
   antibiotic therapy.  Consent to be obtained from patient
s son who is
   pursuing guardianship.
   .
   # Acute HCT drop: Stable currently, but stool guaiac +.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile.
   - See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Will place on low level standing glargine and change
   humalog to regular insulin for sliding scale to provide better glycemic
   control.
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Metabolic alkolosis
   improved after diamox.  Replete electrolytes PRN.
   .
   # Access:  PIV x 2
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to
   filter out any influence on his mental status, without improvement; On

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX. He is suffering from neurologic impairment with?spinal cord compression. The patient has been intubated for 11+ days and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the MICU. He is being treated for several medical conditions, including pneumonia, potential sepsis, altered mental status, and hypertensive urgency/hypertension.

The patient's recent events include a positive blood culture for coag-negative staph, which has led to the removal of his PICC line tip. There is also a discussion about the possibility of placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube after obtaining multiple negative blood cultures while on antibiotic therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # Cord injury?: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on CT imaging.  Patient could not lie flat for
   MRI scanner without sedation and was placed in a soft c-collar per
   ortho spine recs.  Due to concern for possible epidural abscess in the
   setting of fevers, abnormal neurologic exam, and possible cord lesion
   patient was reintubated on [**12-22**] to have definitive MRI imaging.  No
   evidence of epidural abscess or cord compression on MRI but does have
   some cervical spine stenosis.
   - Neuro following, recommends EMG for ? critical illness
   neuropathy/myopathy & repeat EEG
   - Will discuss MRI results w/ ortho spine; till then soft collar
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He did have
   relatively uncoordinated respiratory movements this morning as he has
   in the past.  Continuing nebs & seroquel.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Decrease prednisone to 40mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs and xopenex nebs to avoid tachycardia and
   increased agitation
   - SBT this morning with goal to extubated this afternoon if pt.
   tolerating attempt to wean from vent and pending PEG tube placement.
   - BiPAP or Heliox trial in an attempt to reduce upper airway
   resistance.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], and [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles).    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**],
   no growth yet on [**3-16**] from [**12-20**] or from [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] blood cultures.
   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  Unclear if one or
   more of these represent contamination.  PICC line removed on [**12-23**].
   Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.  No vegetations seen on
   [**12-22**] ECHO.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for now and check surveillance cultures.
   .
   # PEG placement: Will discuss with general surgery today.  Consent to
   be obtained from patient
s son who is pursuing guardianship.
   .
   # Acute HCT drop: Stable currently, but stool guaiac +.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   .
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   intermittently hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely
   over.  Mental status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to
   investigate AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt
   currently becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   - PRN Morphine.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile.
   - See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Will place on low level standing glargine and change
   humalog to regular insulin for sliding scale to provide better glycemic
   control.
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Metabolic alkolosis
   improved after diamox.  Replete electrolytes PRN.
   .
   # Access:  PIV x 1
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, discontinued the H2 blocker to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. He presented initially with shortness of breath and was later found to have bilateral pneumothoraces. He experienced cardiac arrest twice and underwent therapeutic hypothermia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with coag-negative Staphylococcus infection, as evidenced by positive blood cultures. He has also shown signs of agitation, mental status changes, and hypertension, which may be attributed to alcohol withdrawal or other causes. His blood pressure has been labile, with readings in the 180s/120s during episodes of agitation.

The patient's neurologic exam shows some abnormalities, including minimal asymmetric pupils, negative doll's eyes, spontaneous movements, and opening eyes to noxious stimuli. There is a concern for possible spinal cord compression, but this has not been definitively confirmed by MRI.

The patient's respiratory status has been monitored closely, with the use of nebulizers, bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and Heliox trials to reduce upper airway resistance. He is currently on mechanical ventilation (MV) with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slight"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # Cord injury?: Uncertain whether patient has some degree of cervical
   cord compression based on CT imaging.  Patient could not lie flat for
   MRI scanner without sedation and was placed in a soft c-collar per
   ortho spine recs.  Due to concern for possible epidural abscess in the
   setting of fevers, abnormal neurologic exam, and possible cord lesion
   patient was reintubated on [**12-22**] to have definitive MRI imaging.  No
   evidence of epidural abscess or cord compression on MRI but does have
   some cervical spine stenosis.
   - Neuro following, recommends EMG for ? critical illness
   neuropathy/myopathy & repeat EEG
   - Will discuss MRI results w/ ortho spine; till then soft collar
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  Was not able to
   be extubated yesterday due to respiratory distress during SBTs.
   Continuing nebs & seroquel.   Unclear why patient was given albuterol
   overnight when he was ordered for xopenex instead.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Day 1 of prednisone at 40mg PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs and xopenex nebs to avoid tachycardia and
   increased agitation
   - SBT this morning with goal to extubated this afternoon if pt.
   tolerating attempt to wean from vent and pending PEG tube placement.
   - BiPAP or Heliox trial in an attempt to reduce upper airway
   resistance.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], and [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles).    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**],
   no growth yet on [**3-16**] from [**12-20**] or from [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] blood cultures.
   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  Unclear if one or
   more of these represent contamination.  PICC line removed on [**12-23**].
   Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending down.  No vegetations seen on
   [**12-22**] ECHO.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for now and check surveillance cultures.
   .
   # PEG placement: Will discuss with general surgery today.  Consent to
   be obtained from patient
s son who is pursuing guardianship.
   .
   # Acute HCT drop: Stable currently, but stool guaiac +.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   .
   # Agitation, mental status: Agitation improved, continues to be
   intermittently hypertensive.  EtOH withdrawal and risk of DTs likely
   over.  Mental status appears to be improving.  Following neuro recs to
   investigate AMS further.  Pt. cannot tolerate lying flat for MRI.  Pt
   currently becomes agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - Captopril for hypertension
   - Seroquel 50mg PO TID
   - Cont. Ativan for agitation.
   - PRN Morphine.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and previous cardiac arrest. He presented initially with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, and left against medical advice. The patient suffered from neurologic impairment with suspected spinal cord compression. He underwent an MRI, which did not show evidence of epidural abscess or cord compression but revealed some cervical spine stenosis. The patient was reintubated for MRI studies and was not extubated due to respiratory distress during spontaneous breathing trials. He has positive blood cultures for coag-negative staph, and his WBC count is trending down. The patient also has hypertension, agitation, mental status changes, and potential ethanol withdrawal. He is currently being treated with various medications, including Vancomycin for the positive blood cultures, and is awaiting PEG tube placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Intensive care unit (ICU) stay and the use of sedatives and pain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): With the positive blood cultures and the presence of a"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with history of COPD and complicated by ongoing respiratory
   failure which has been driven in large part by his background lung
   disease which is represented by chronic fixed obstruction and in the
   setting of tachypnea he moves quite rapidly to dynamic hyperinflation
   and worsening respiratory distress.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with re-intubation for MRI study.
   Patient now with persistent tachycardia, tachypnea and persistent
   hypercarbic failure.  This is despite patient with maximal treatment
   for agitation and with this mornings events patient with ABG
   7.36/66/131
   -Patient with RSBI of 71 and SBT started this morning
   -He will have extubation with need for intermittent BIPAP following
   extubation given extent of compromise should he meet qualification for
   extubation and he has quite a limited capacity to tolerate non-invasive
   ventilation given his issues of agitation and this concern is a  real
   barrier to safe support of extubation.
   -Steroids have failed to provide a durable response with wean and will
   continue with IV 80mg q 8 hours
   -Atrovent q 6 hours standing
   -B-agonist q 4 hours
   -PRR b-agonist
   -Repeat CT Scan of chest with concern for incapacity to clear
   ventilatory capacities
   -NIF to check today for possible NM weakness that has been
   under-represented to date
   2)Cervical Cord Lesion-
   -MRI reassuring and patient exam stable
   -C-Collar to be D/C
d if able based upon consultant from Neurology
   input.
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -MRI showed no evidence of parenchymal injury--only chronic small
   vessel ischemia and no diffusion abnormalities to explain persistent
   altered mental status.  Source is not entirely clear
will pursue
   minimization of offending medications.  EEG to evaluate for seizure
   activity
   -Seroquel TID
   -MOve to full exam with extubation when possible
   -MRI reassuring
   -EEG and EMG to evaluate
   -LP to be discussed with neurology to possible alternative causes, MRI
   has been reassuring
   4)Fever--Likely catheter related blood stream in infection but with
   sinusitis suggested overall.
   -Vanco to continue

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD who has been experiencing ongoing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to persistent tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypercarbic failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's background lung disease, represented by chronic fixed obstruction, combined with tachypnea can lead to dynamic hyperinflation and worsening respiratory distress. The patient's current respiratory failure is persistent despite maximal treatment for agitation and ABG showing 7.36/66/131.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to various causes such as medication-related side effects, infection, or other underlying conditions. An MRI has been done to evaluate for any parenchymal injury, but it showed only chronic small vessel ischemia. EEG and EMG evaluations are planned to further assess the situation.

3. Fever: The patient is likely experiencing a fever, which could be due to a catheter-related bloodstream infection or sinusitis. Antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin is ongoing.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This could be due to hemorrhage or bleeding during medical procedures.

5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's medical history includes cardiac arrest, which may have contributed to the current respiratory failure and altered mental"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented with
   SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x 2
   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  Was not able to
   be extubated yesterday due to respiratory distress during SBTs.
   Continues to look poorly from a respiratory standpoint despite
   appearing adequately sedated with seroquel.  Although it seemed likely
   that underlying lung disease was keeping him from being extubated,
   however the CT did not support this. It may be that he is now becoming
   deconditioned and this is contributing to his respiratory failure.  It
   is also possible that his COPD was steroid dependent and we tapered his
   steroids too quickly.  With increasing his steroids over the last 24
   hours, his air-movement has improved.  Agitation is also likely a
   contributing factorPatient is 11+ 4 days total of intubation currently.
   - Increase prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - SBT today w/ABG before attempting extubation.
   - Consider BiPAP or Heliox immediately following extubation.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   # Cord injury?: MRI scan shows no evidence of epidural abscess or cord
   compression.  There is some cervical spine stenosis at C2-C3 and
   C3-C4.  MRI neg for cord injury.
   - soft collar d/c
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Reason for altered mental status and
   unresponsiveness remains unclear.  MRI of brain without evidence of
   significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical illness and multiple
   medications that he has received.  Neurology is following.  B12 level
   normal.
   - EMG & repeat EEG studies today
   - continue to follow neurology recommendations.
   - increase seroquel to 50 mg PO BID and 25 mg prn agitation.
   - d/c ativan
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], and [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles
 2^nd showed no
   growth).    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**], [**12-25**],
   [**12-26**] blood cultures.  Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from
   [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.
   Unclear if one or more of these represent contamination, although
   culture of IV tip and BCx had matching results.  Otherwise afebrile and
   WBCs are trending down.  No vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for 14 day course (start [**12-22**] to end [**1-5**]) and
   continue to check surveillance cultures.
   # Acute HCT drop: Stable currently, but stool guaiac +.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.
   - Increase Captopril to 37.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family to come to see patient and check in with team this weekend.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   .
   # PEG placement: Discussed with general surgery.  They are willing to
   place after patient has multiple negative blood cultures while on
   antibiotic therapy.  Consent to be obtained from patient
s son who is
   pursuing guardianship.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath and was likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation. He had a cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes removed for pneumothorax. The patient suffered from neurologic impairment with suspected spinal cord compression.

The patient was reintubated due to respiratory distress during spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). He continues to appear poorly from a respiratory standpoint despite appearing adequately sedated with seroquel. The increase in steroids has improved his air movement. Agitation is also likely contributing to his respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for 11+ days.

The patient's chest CT showed moderate emphysema and a 4x2mm right mid-lobe nodule. The MRI scan showed no evidence of epidural abscess or cord compression, only cervical spine stenosis at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels. There were positive blood cultures with coag-negative Staphylococcus in bottles from 12-15, 12-17, and 12-20, but the patient has been afebrile and WBCs are trending down. No vegetations were seen on 12-22 ECHO.

The patient has several medical issues including altered mental status, possible cord injury, hypertension, acute HCT drop, and a history of CAD with a silent"

   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering neurologic
   impairment with ?spinal cord compression.
   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  Was not able to
   be extubated yesterday due to respiratory distress during SBTs.
   Continues to look poorly from a respiratory standpoint despite
   appearing adequately sedated with seroquel.   It is likely his
   underlying lung disease that is keeping him from being extubated at
   this point.  Previously his COPD has been steroid responsive.  Patient
   is 11+ 3 days total of intubation currently.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Increase prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Chest CT to further evaluate lungs and r/o other processes (e.g,
   mycetoma given high dose steroid treatment)
   - Reassess respiratory status this evening to consider SBT again
   tomorrow.
   - Consider BiPAP or Heliox trial once extubated.
   .
   # Cord injury?: MRI scan shows no evidence of epidural abscess or cord
   compression.  There is some cervical spine stenosis at C2-C3 and
   C3-C4.
   - Will discuss MRI results w/ ortho spine to check if okay to clear
   from soft collar
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Reason for altered mental status and
   unresponsiveness remains unclear.  MRI of brain without evidence of
   significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical illness and multiple
   medications that he has received.  Neurology is following.  B12 level
   normal.
   - EMG & repeat EEG studies ordered and pending
   - continue seroquel 25 mg PO TID and 25 mg prn agitation.
   - continue ativan and propofol.
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], and [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles).    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**],
   no growth yet on [**2-13**] from [**12-20**] or from [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] blood cultures.
   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed
   [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.  Unclear if one or more of these
   represent contamination.  Otherwise afebrile and WBCs are trending
   down.  No vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   - Cont. Vancomycin for 14 day course (start [**12-22**] to end [**1-5**]) and
   continue to check surveillance cultures.
   .
   # PEG placement: Discussed with general surgery.  They are willing to
   place after patient has multiple negative blood cultures while on
   antibiotic therapy.  Consent to be obtained from patient
s son who is
   pursuing guardianship.
   .
   # Acute HCT drop: Stable currently, but stool guaiac +.  Will continue
   to monitor.
   .
   #. Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.
   - Increase Captopril to 12.5 PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - Nebulizers only prn.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Pursuing conversations with the family
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   # S/P cardiac arrest: Etiologies include pneumothorax, hypoxia,
   hyperkalemia, acidosis, among others. Seizure may have been a component
   of initial arrest given unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and
   incontinence. Received multiple rounds epi and atropine in the ED, as
   well as 3x shocks. 2^nd arrest am [**12-5**] during cooling protocol.
   Current neoro exam 48 hours from arrest s/p cooling and rewarming with
   minimal reaction however still sedated since becomes tachypneic
   agitated when sedation weaned.  Completed Arctic Sun protocol [**12-6**] and
   rewarmed, off paralytics; Had a head CT without intracranial pathology
   but has fluid in sinuses.
   - Continue supportive care s/p arrest.
   # Sinusitis: Pt
s head CT has fluid in sinuses and has purulent
   drainage L nostril c/w possible sinusitis. Currently afebrile.
   - See treatment above
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: normal on check [**2104-12-4**], slightly
   elevated on repeat but has had episodes hypotension, cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Will place on low level standing glargine and change
   humalog to regular insulin for sliding scale to provide better glycemic
   control.
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Metabolic alkolosis
   improved after diamox.  Replete electrolytes PRN.

   would not want prolonged and chronic care within a facility.  We
   described the current clinical pathway of recurrent decline and failure
   as being one where we will have to consider tracheostomy and PEG tube

   limiting capacity to tolerate extubation.  This is in the setting of
   renewed maximal efforts at creating control of his airflow obstruction
   and minimize chances of failure of extubation.  He has had reassuring
   findings on MRI scanning noted but will undergo further evaluation with
   neurology and EEG to look to evaluate altered mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU with prolonged courses of altered mental status, bacteremia, and intermittent respiratory failure. The patient has dynamic hyperinflation limiting his ability to tolerate extubation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/104 mmHg to 92/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, sodium level of 119 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 86 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is thin, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. His cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. The respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, and diminished breath sounds. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with soft and non-tender abdomen and present bowel sounds. Extremities are absent on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's son expressed concern about the patient's wishes for end-of-life care, specifically regarding tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The healthcare team will continue to provide full treatment and allow the family to consider the goals of care over the next two days before rediscussing based on the patient's progress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicate respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Anemia, Acute Secondary to Blood Loss: The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level, indicating acute anemia. This may be due to blood loss during his cardiac arrest or other sources of bleeding.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which can be a result of various factors including sedation, encephalopathy, or underlying brain injury.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD increases his risk for exacerbations, which can worsen his respiratory status and potentially lead to respiratory failure.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance indicate potential imbalances that may need correction to maintain"

   24 Hour Events:
   Extensive discussions with patient's son held by myself and the social
   worker involved ([**Doctor Last Name 212**]).  He would describe his father as someone who
   would not want prolonged and chronic care within a facility.  We
   described the current clinical pathway of recurrent decline and failure
   as being one where we will have to consider tracheostomy and PEG tube
   placment for chronic care.  In light of this Mr. [**Known lastname 3596**] son voiced
   concern that this would not be consistent with his father's wishes.
   We will continue to treat fully and allow Mr. [**Known lastname 3596**] family to
   consider goals of care over the next two days and rediscuss based on
   his progress in the interim.

   64 yo male with admission with respiratory failure and now with
   prolonged course of both altered mental status, bacteremia and
   intermittent respiratory failure.  He has had dynamic hyperinflation
   limiting capacity to tolerate extubation.  This is in the setting of
   renewed maximal efforts at creating control of his airflow obstruction
   and minimize chances of failure of extubation.  He has had reassuring
   findings on MRI scanning noted but will undergo further evaluation with
   neurology and EEG to look to evaluate altered mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with respiratory failure, altered mental status, bacteremia, and intermittent respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by dynamic hyperinflation limiting capacity to tolerate extubation. He has a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other comorbidities such as anxiety, hypertension, and chronic respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, which is likely due to impaired strength and underlying lung disease. There is a need to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation (PSV mode) as tolerated and continue with steroid treatment and bronchodilators. A trial of extubation may be considered when the patient can tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

2. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient may be at risk of developing anemia due to blood loss during the course of treatment. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and timely transfusion if necessary may be required.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium. Further evaluation through EEG and other neurologic assessments may be needed. Medication adjustment, such as reducing the dose of Seroquel, may also be considered.

4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest increases the risk of recurrent events. Continuous"

   depressed mental status
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles
 2^nd showed no growth),
   and [**12-26**].    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**],
   [**12-25**] blood cultures.  Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from
   [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.
   Unclear if one or more of these represent contamination, although
   culture of IV tip and BCx had matching results, so unlikely that result
   is contaminate.  Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations
   seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   -          Cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-26**] BCx
   -          Continue to check surveillance cultures.
   -          Consider re-echo and u/s UE if BCx continue to be
   intermittently positive
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated yesterday afternoon. With a good follow-up ABG.
   - Continue prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   - ABG if tachypnic
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Reason for altered mental status and
   unresponsiveness remains unclear.  MRI of brain without evidence of
   significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical illness and multiple
   medications that he has received.  Neurology is following.  B12 level
   normal.
   - f/u EEG, EMG
   - continue to follow neurology recommendations.
   - increase seroquel to 75 mg PO BID and 25 mg prn agitation.
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
   -trend Hct
   -re-check stool FOB if Hct acutely drops
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family to come to see patient and check in with team this weekend.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW

   # PEG placement: Discussed with general surgery.  They are willing to
   place after patient has multiple negative blood cultures while on
   antibiotic therapy.  Consent to be obtained from patient
s son who is
   pursuing guardianship.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who presented with shortness of breath and was initially treated for a likely COPD exacerbation. However, the patient left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice with bilateral chest tubes removed due to pneumothorax. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday afternoon with a good follow-up arterial blood gas (ABG).

The patient's current medical conditions include:

   .
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  Was not able to
   be extubated yesterday due to respiratory distress during SBTs.
   Continues to look poorly from a respiratory standpoint despite
   appearing adequately sedated with seroquel.  Although it seemed likely
   that underlying lung disease was keeping him from being extubated,
   however the CT did not support this. It may be that he is now becoming
   deconditioned and this is contributing to his respiratory failure.  It
   is also possible that his COPD was steroid dependent and we tapered his
   steroids too quickly.  With increasing his steroids over the last 24
   hours, his air-movement has improved.  Agitation is also likely a
   contributing factorPatient is 11+ 4 days total of intubation currently.

The plan is to increase prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment, continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn Q2H (without albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation), perform SBT today with ABG before attempting extubation, consider BiPAP or Heliox immediately following extubation, and trend WBC count and fever curve.

Regarding the patient's altered mental status and unresponsiveness, the MRI of the brain showed no evidence of significant an"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient was extubated last night and is doing well overnight. However, they lost IV access overnight and have a single positive blood culture this morning. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 36.4 C (97.6 F)
- Heart rate: 85 bpm
- Blood pressure: 109/67 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's weight has decreased from 79.4 kg at admission to 68.6 kg currently. The total fluid intake is 1,671 mL, with 412 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 1,139 mL through intravenous fluids, and a total output of 958 mL including urine output of 265 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with a face tent and standby ventilator mode. The tidal volume (Vt) is 960 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 0 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure and now presents with a prolonged course of altered mental status, bacteremia, and intermittent respiratory failure. He has had dynamic hyperinflation limiting his ability to tolerate extubation. The patient underwent an MRI scan with reassuring findings, but further evaluation with neurology and EEG is planned to assess the altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has impaired strength and a background lung disease contributing to his respiratory failure. He was recently extubated and is currently holding his own with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. He will continue receiving Solumedrol 80mg q 8 hours and bronchodilators as needed.
2. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's altered mental status requires further evaluation with an EEG and consultation with neurology. Seroquel has been prescribed, and the patient's MRI findings are reassuring.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture, indicating bacteremia. Sensitivity testing is pending, but it is likely to be coag-negative Staphylococcus. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the culture results.
4. Loss of IV access: The patient lost IV access overnight. Efforts should be made to establish peripheral intravenous (PIV) access, and if unsuccessful, a central venous line (CVL), preferably in the femoral site, may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He was admitted with respiratory failure and now presents with altered mental status, bacteremia, intermittent respiratory failure, and dynamic hyperinflation. The patient underwent an MRI scan with reassuring findings, but further evaluation with neurology and EEG is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of background lung disease and impaired strength, which may contribute to respiratory failure. He was recently extubated but is still on supplemental oxygen. The plan is to continue with Solumedrol and bronchodilators.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and it is not considered delirium. He requires further evaluation with EEG and consultation from neurology. Seroquel has been prescribed, and an MRI showed reassuring findings.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a single positive blood culture, indicating bacteremia. The sensitivity results are pending, but it is likely coag-negative Staphylococcus. Antibiotics should be started as soon as possible.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance and fluid disorder, which requires careful monitoring and management.
5. Potential Infection: The positive blood culture suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and adjust the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure. He has a prolonged course of altered mental status, bacteremia, and intermittent respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated but still requires respiratory support. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and anxiety. The patient also has hypertension, benign. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's background lung disease and impaired strength may contribute to respiratory failure. He was recently extubated but continues to require oxygenation and ventilation support.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium. He is currently on Seroquel and will undergo further evaluation with neurology and EEG to assess his mental status.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a single positive blood culture, indicating bacteremia. The specific type of bacteria is not yet identified but is likely coag-negative Staphylococcus. Sensitivity testing is pending.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which need to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and extent of blood loss.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest. It is important to monitor his cardiovascular status closely"

   with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Extubated and suffering continued
   depressed mental status
   .
   # Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Coag neg Staph in
   bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles
 2^nd showed no growth),
   and [**12-26**].    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**],
   [**12-25**] blood cultures.  Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from
   [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.
   Unclear if one or more of these represent contamination, although
   culture of IV tip and BCx had matching results, so unlikely that result
   is contaminate.  Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations
   seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   -          Cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-26**] BCx
   -          Continue to check surveillance cultures.
   -          Consider re-echo and u/s UE if BCx continue to be
   intermittently positive
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated yesterday afternoon. With a good follow-up ABG.
   - Continue prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   - ABG if tachypnic
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Reason for altered mental status and
   unresponsiveness remains unclear.  MRI of brain without evidence of
   significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical illness and multiple
   medications that he has received.  Neurology is following.  B12 level
   normal.
   - f/u EEG, EMG
   - continue to follow neurology recommendations.
   - increase seroquel to 75 mg PO BID and 25 mg prn agitation.
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
   -trend Hct
   -re-check stool FOB if Hct acutely drops
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family to come to see patient and check in with team this weekend.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW
   .
   # PEG placement: Discussed with general surgery.  They are willing to
   place after patient has multiple negative blood cultures while on
   antibiotic therapy.  Consent to be obtained from patient
s son who is
   pursuing guardianship.
   ..
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   - psych to see once patient extubated, able to better communicate.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient with BG 133-170 currently.
   -on low level standing glargine and regular insulin with sliding scale
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs. Metabolic alkolosis
   improved after diamox.  Replete electrolytes PRN.
   .
   # Access:  No access currently and patient in need of Vancomycin,
   Steroids. Want to avoid central venous line b/c of positive blood
   cultures.
   - nurses will try for peripheral IV placement today -> if unable will
   call anesthesia -> if unable will try u/s guided -> if unable will
   place femoral line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation. The patient left against medical advice (AMA) but later suffered from cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes inserted for pneumothorax (PTX). The patient was extubated but continued to have a depressed mental status.

Positive blood cultures have been obtained multiple times, including coag-negative Staphylococcus, which has shown resistance to vancomycin. The patient's blood cultures have been intermittently positive, and there is uncertainty regarding contamination or multiple infections. The patient has been afebrile, and no vegetations were seen on an echocardiogram performed on 12/22.

The patient's altered mental status and unresponsiveness remain unclear, and an MRI of the brain did not show significant anoxic brain injury or other causes for encephalopathy. The neurology team is following up, and further EEG and EMG studies are planned.

The patient also has anemia, with a positive stool guaiac test. Trends in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit levels will be monitored, and if the patient becomes symptomatic or the hematocrit level drops, a transfusion may be necessary. The patient's hypertension is being managed with captopril, and beta-blockers are being withheld due to br"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and bipolar disorder. He presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice. He later experienced cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothorax. He was extubated but remained in a depressed mental status. The patient's blood cultures have shown positive for coag-negative staphylococci on multiple occasions, but the source of the infection is unclear. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and is afebrile. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now on BiPAP. His mental status remains altered, and an EEG and EMG have been ordered. The patient also has anemia with a positive stool guaiac, hypertension, and a history of CAD with a silent myocardial infarction. He is on multiple medications including ASA, captopril, steroids, and insulin for hyperglycemia. The patient's medical decision-making is being handled by his brother and son, and guardianship paperwork is in progress. PEG placement has been discussed, and the patient's PTSD/bipolar disorder needs further evaluation by psychiatry. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures have been positive for coag-negative staphylococci, indicating a potential ongoing infection. This could lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, now presenting with respiratory distress. He has been admitted with altered mental status, bacteremia, and intermittent respiratory failure. The patient has shown dynamic hyperinflation, limiting his ability to tolerate extubation. An MRI scan was performed, revealing reassuring findings, but further evaluation with neurology and EEG is planned to assess the altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of impaired strength and background lung disease. Continuous monitoring and management with bronchodilators and steroids will be necessary.
2. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's altered mental status requires ongoing evaluation with neurology and EEG. Medications such as Seroquel may be used to manage agitation.
3. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Sensitivity testing for blood cultures is pending.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance should be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing COPD may worsen due to the acute exacerbation. Management should include bronchodilators and steroids.
6. Nutritional Status: The patient requires proper nutrition support, as indicated by the initiation of Fibersource HN ("

 Extubated x 48 hrs and he is holding his own
   with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Does have period agitation
   with tahcynea breath stcaking and distress but resolves either on its
   own or with anti psychotics.
   Continue with Solumedrol 80mg q 8 hrs but would favor convert to po by
   AM.  -Bronchodilators standing. Cpould need NIPPV again if does not
   respond.
   2) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)- DDX underlying psych disorder,
   ICU delirium and possible anoxia.
   -Seroquel for agitation. Avoid other sedating meds.
   -EEG complete

   3) Bacteremia: Repeat + Blood Cx: recurrent GPC in blood. TTE negative
   but may need TEE and spine MRI to rule out epidural abscess. Must
   weightlikely   need for reintubation to get these invasive procedures
   versus repeat TEE and empiric ABX
 will continue ABX for now but if

He was admitted with respiratory failure and has had a prolonged course of altered mental status, bacteremia, and intermittent respiratory failure. The patient underwent an MRI scan which showed reassuring findings, and further evaluation with neurology and EEG is planned to assess the altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been extubated for 48 hours and is holding his own with adequate oxygenation and ventilation. He experiences periodic agitation, tachypnea, breath stacking, and distress but these symptoms resolve on their own or with the use of antipsychotics. The plan is to continue with Solumedrol 80mg q8h and convert to oral medication by AM. Bronchodilators will be given as needed, and NIPPV may be required if the patient does not respond.

2. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's altered mental status may be due to underlying psychiatric disorder, ICU delirium, or possible anoxia. Seroquel will be given for agitation, and other sedating medications will be avoided. An EEG has been ordered, and consultation with neurology is planned.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has recurrent GPC in his blood. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a face tent with supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, although it is currently set to standby mode. They have been experiencing agitation, which has been responsive to sedation. The patient's blood cultures were taken on 12/27/2104 at 09:45 PM, and they have been receiving antibiotics since 12/28/2104 at 08:10 AM. The patient's allergies are unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition indicates acute respiratory failure. The need for mechanical ventilation suggests a severe impairment in gas exchange or airway protection.
2. Infection: The blood cultures taken on 12/27/2104 suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis or septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Delirium or Altered Mental Status: The patient"

   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed
   [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been
   afebrile. No vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   -          Cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   -          Continue to check surveillance cultures.
   -          TTE today
   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clearer today.  Oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula.
   Respiratory distress related more to agitation.
   - Slow steroid taper with Prednisone 60mg PO qday for several days (1
   week), then taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 75mg PO BID and PRN.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - psych consult on [**12-29**]
   - increase Seroquel to 100mg PO BID, change PRN to q8 hours
   - f/u psych recs for further management
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
   -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Start Amlodipine 5mg PO qday today; continue Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW; waiting for son to
   return paperwork to SW
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) and later experienced cardiac arrest twice, resulting in bilateral chest tube placement for pneumothorax. The patient's mental status is depressed but seems to be improving. He has positive blood cultures growing coag-negative staphylococci and a PICC line tip also growing coag-negative staph. The patient is currently afebrile with no vegetations seen on an echocardiogram. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- SOB/Resp Failure: The patient had been protecting his own airway and was reintubated to have MRI studies. He was successfully extubated on [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up ABG. Lungs are clearer today, and he is oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula. Respiratory distress is related more to agitation.
- Altered Mental Status: Improving today with supportive care. An MRI of the brain showed no evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain encephalopathy. The patient's critical illness and multiple medications may be contributing to his mental status changes. Neurology is following up, and an EEG and EMG were unrevealing. Seroquel 75mg PO BID and PRN is being prescribed.
- Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
- Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and atenolol. He likely has hypertension at baseline and requires some medication for this. HTN also corresponds to agitation. Captopril at 37.5 PO TID is being continued, and Amlodipine 5mg PO qday is being started.
- CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: The patient had a silent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and multiple shocks. ASA is being added, and beta-blockers are being held due to intermittent bradycardia and bronchospasm. A statin is also being considered.
- Medical decision making: Family members visited the patient and were encouraged by his progress. They will try to have family visiting to help orient the patient and provide a familiar face. Pursuing guardianship paperwork was given to social work, waiting for the son to return paperwork to social work. The patient is okay with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement if deemed medically necessary.
- PTSD/bipolar disorder: The patient appears not to be on medications as an outpatient. Per family, he has been seen in the VA system. A psych consult is pending once the patient is extubated and able to better communicate.
- Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are currently ranging from 133-170. He is on low-level standing glarg"

   [**12-25**] blood cultures.  Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from
   [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.
   Unclear if one or more of these represent contamination, although
   culture of IV tip and BCx had matching results, so unlikely that result
   is contaminate.  Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations
   seen on [**12-22**] ECHO.
   -          Cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-26**] BCx
   -          Continue to check surveillance cultures.

   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.
   - Continue prednisone to 80 mg IV Q8H PO qday for COPD treatment
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   - ABG if tachypnic

 Reason for altered mental status and
   unresponsiveness remains unclear.  MRI of brain without evidence of
   significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical illness and multiple
   medications that he has received.  Neurology is following.  B12 level
   normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder and has not taken
   medications that he was previously prescribed.
   - f/u EEG, EMG
   - continue to follow neurology recommendations.
   - increased seroquel to 75 mg PO BID and 25 mg prn agitation.
   - psych consult on [**12-29**]
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
   -trend Hct
   -re-check stool FOB if Hct acutely drops
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) but later experienced cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothorax. The patient was extubated but continued to have a depressed mental status.

Positive blood cultures were obtained on [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (one of two bottles showed no growth), and [**12-26**].

The patient's blood cultures from the PICC line tip also grew coag-negative Staphylococcus. It is unclear if these represent contamination or an actual infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/97 mmHg to 209/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with history of COPD now with persistent respiratory failure
   as issue with continued need for close support of weaning.  This has
   been excellent progress in terms of his respiratory failure in the
   setting of significant lung disease.  Patient actually having meaninful
   resposne to quesitons in regards to place and time.
   Respiratory Failure-Patient extubated over weekend and maintaining
   stable status post extubation largely attributable to improved
   bronchospasm, improved volume status, decreased agitation and
   persistent bronchodilator therapy.
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -Continue with bronchodilators
   -Solumedrol to wean via
Predisone taper
   Sepsis-Bacteremia persists with unclear source-
   -[**Name (NI) 3667**]
   -Keep peripheral IV if possible
   -Continue with Vancomycin
   -C-spine imaged, exam reassuring to date with patient extubated
   -Follow neuro exam
   -Will need TEE follow up and final read
   Altered Mental Status-
   -Seroquel used to good effect with standing dosing increased
   -Will need continued PT to improve patient status
   -Will confer with neurology about dosing of medications
   -Will need emergency guardianship as his care goes forward

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. He was recently extubated and is maintaining stable status post-extubation. The patient's progress notes indicate that he is making meaningful responses to questions regarding place and time, suggesting improved mental status.

The patient has a persistent bacteremia with an unclear source, and sepsis remains a concern. He continues to receive vancomycin as part of his antibiotic treatment. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to improved bronchospasm, improved volume status, decreased agitation, and persistent bronchodilator therapy. The plan is to wean off oxygen as tolerated and continue with bronchodilators.

The patient also has anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, altered mental status, cardiac arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and anxiety. His hypertension is noted as benign.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving fiber source nutrition and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. He has an 18-gauge line in place and is receiving prophylactic SQ UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis and PPI for stress ulcer prevention. The patient's VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) status is negative. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently being kept in the ICU."

   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.

   [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**], [**12-25**] blood cultures.
   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed
   [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been
   afebrile. No vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo. Staph from
   [**12-26**] sensitive to Vancomycin.  Still no clear source for positive
   blood cultures.  Possible that multiple tubes are contaminated w/skin
   flora?  Possibility for mycotic aneurysm (R femoral pulse more
   prominent than left, bruit heard)
          -       Ultrasound for aneurysm in R femoral area
   -          Cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   -          Continue to check surveillance cultures.
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clearer today.  Oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula.
   Respiratory distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn
   doses and with nebulizer treatments.
   - Slow steroid taper with Prednisone 60mg PO qday for several days (1
   week), then taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 100mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.   IV thiamine re-started.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - psych consult on [**12-29**]
   - increase Seroquel to 150mg PO BID today,  PRN is 25-50mg q8 hours
   - f/u psych recs for further management
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Start Amlodipine 5mg PO qday today; continue Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - increase free H2O flushes to 300cc Q3 hours
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW; waiting for son to
   return paperwork to SW
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who presented with shortness of breath and was initially thought to have a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) but later experienced cardiac arrest twice, and bilateral chest tubes were placed for pneumothorax. The patient was intubated, extubated, and currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Positive Blood Cultures: The patient has been growing coag-negative staphylococci in blood cultures since 12/15, with sensitivities different from 12/20. No clear source of infection has been identified, and the possibility of contamination or a mycotic aneurysm is being considered. Vancomycin has been continued based on the 12/27 BCx.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory distress and was reintubated for MRI studies on 12/22. He was successfully extubated on 12/26 but required nebulizer treatments for agitation. His lungs are clearer today, and he is oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula. BiPAP has been considered if re-intubation is needed.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been depressed but seems to be improving. An MRI of the brain showed no evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other causes for encephalopathy."

   # SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clearer today.  Oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula.
   Respiratory distress related more to agitation.
   - Slow steroid taper with Prednisone 60mg PO qday for several days (1
   week), then taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   # Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 75mg PO BID and PRN.

   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Start Amlodipine 5mg PO qday today; continue Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW; waiting for son to
   return paperwork to SW

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath and was likely experiencing a COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) but later returned after experiencing cardiac arrest twice. Bilateral chest tubes were placed for pneumothorax (PTX) and subsequently removed. The patient was extubated successfully, and his mental status is improving with supportive care.

Positive blood cultures have grown coag-negative staphylococci, and he has been afebrile. No vegetations were seen on the echocardiogram. Vancomycin was restarted based on recent blood culture results.

The patient had respiratory failure requiring reintubation, but he is now oxygenating well on a nasal canula. A steroid taper with prednisone is planned, along with nebs (atrovent and xopenex) every 6 hours, and BiPAP if needed for re-intubation.

His altered mental status is improving, and an MRI of the brain did not show significant anoxic brain injury or other causes for encephalopathy. B12 levels are normal, and he has a history of bipolar disorder. An EEG and EMG were unrevealing, and Seroquel was increased to 100mg PO BID.

The patient has stable an"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has successfully been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen and bronchodilators with steroids. He is also receiving Heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate between 82-146 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/67-191/111 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, distant heart sounds, diminished breath sounds with mild wheezes, and a prominent right femoral pulse without bruit. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and moves upper and lower extremities freely.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 344 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 292 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 107-142 mg/dL. Imaging shows no evidence of deep vein thrombosis"

   64M homeless man w h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented
   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.
   .
   #1 Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph: Now cultures
   growing GPCs [**2104-12-27**].  Coag neg Staph in bottles from [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**]
   (1 of 2 bottles
 2^nd showed no growth), and [**12-26**].    Neg x 2 on
   [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**], [**12-25**] blood cultures.
   Sensitivities from [**12-20**] are different from [**12-15**].  PICC line tip removed
   [**12-23**] also growing Coag neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been
   afebrile. No vegetations seen on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo. Staph from
   [**12-26**] sensitive to Vancomycin.  Still no clear source for positive
   blood cultures.  Possible that multiple tubes are contaminated w/skin
   flora?  Possibility for mycotic aneurysm (R femoral pulse more
   prominent than left, bruit heard)
          -       Ultrasound for aneurysm in R femoral area
   -          Cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   -          Continue to check surveillance cultures.
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clearer today.  Oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula.
   Respiratory distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn
   doses and with nebulizer treatments.
   - Slow steroid taper with Prednisone 60mg PO qday for several days (1
   week), then taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   - Consider BiPAP if it appears patient may need re-intubation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 100mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.   IV thiamine re-started.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - psych consult on [**12-29**]
   - increase Seroquel to 150mg PO BID today,  PRN is 25-50mg q8 hours
   - f/u psych recs for further management
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - Start Amlodipine 5mg PO qday today; continue Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - increase free H2O flushes to 300cc Q3 hours
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork was given to SW; waiting for son to
   return paperwork to SW
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.
   ([**Location (un) 2991**], NY ~10 months ago & [**Location (un) 3637**], GA ~ 3 yrs ago).
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   - psych to see once patient extubated, able to better communicate.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient with BG 133-170 currently.
   -on low level standing glargine and regular insulin with sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who presented with shortness of breath and was initially treated for a likely COPD exacerbation. He left against medical advice (AMA) but later experienced cardiac arrest twice and required bilateral chest tube insertions for pneumothorax. The chest tubes were subsequently removed, and the patient was extubated. He has been improving but continues to have altered mental status, which is thought to be due to his critical illness and multiple medications. The patient has positive blood cultures growing coag-negative staphylococci, with sensitivities different from previous isolates. There is no clear source of infection, and an ultrasound is planned to check for a mycotic aneurysm in the right femoral area due to a prominent pulse and bruit heard. The patient's hypertension requires medication, and he is currently on captopril. Other issues include anemia, hypernatremia, CAD with a silent myocardial infarction, hyperglycemia, PTSD/bipolar disorder, and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's family is involved in his care, and guardianship paperwork is being pursued. The patient's code status is full code.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless man w h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented
   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.
   Persistent bacteremia with coag negative staph.
   .
   #1 Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph:  Coag neg Staph
   [**12-27**], [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles
 2^nd showed no growth), and
   [**12-15**].    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**], [**12-25**]
   blood cultures.  Sensitivities show 2 different morphologies, sensitive
   to vanc but MIC = 2.  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] is likely source of
   Coag neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations
   seen on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo. Staph from [**12-26**] sensitive to
   Vancomycin.  Still no clear source for positive blood cultures, however
   were likely from PICC line, now removed.
   - f/u final read of ultrasound for aneurysm in R femoral area
   - cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   - continue to check surveillance cultures.
   - ID consult for continued management, changing abxs or increased vanc
   dosing
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clearer today.  Oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula.
   Respiratory distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn
   doses and with nebulizer treatments. Not requiring many PRN nebs
   - taper Prednisone with 40mg today
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 150mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - psych consult on [**12-29**]
   - continue current Seroquel dose at 150mg PO BID today,  PRN is 25-50mg
   q8 hours
   - f/u psych recs for further management
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - regimen is Amlodipine 5mg PO qday, Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - increase free H2O flushes
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork done by medical team, SW working
   with family
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   - psych f/u
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient with BG 133-170 currently.
   -on low level standing glargine and regular insulin with sliding scale
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs.  Replete electrolytes
   PRN.

   # Access:  PIV
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, On PPI
   # Code:  FULL code, confirmed with brother & son, will revisit if

   Social work spoke with [**Doctor Last Name 3062**] who would like to make medical decisions
   and pursue guardianship if necessary.  (see SW note).  Guardianship
   paperwork in progress. Guaridian needs to be legal guardian, not family
   because the guardian needs to be in-state.  Family will come in each
   weekend to visit.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and homelessness. He presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation, and left against medical advice. The patient subsequently experienced cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothorax. The chest tubes were removed, and the patient was extubated, showing improvement in mental status. He has persistent bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus and no clear source identified. The patient has undergone multiple interventions and consultations for various conditions, including SOB/respiratory failure, altered mental status, anemia, hypertension, hypernatremia, CAD post-silent myocardial infarction, PTSD/bipolar disorder, hyperglycemia, and access issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Positive Blood Cultures with Coag-negative Staph: The patient has persistent bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus. This may lead to further complications if the source of infection is not identified and treated appropriately.
2. SOB/Resp Failure: The patient initially presented with shortness of breath, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has shown improvement in mental status but still has altered mental status. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration if not managed properly"

1. Mycotic aneurysm in the right femoral area: The presence of a prominent pulse and bruit suggests the possibility of a mycotic aneurysm. Further investigation and appropriate management are necessary to prevent rupture or other complications.

2. Infection: The positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection. The patient is already receiving vancomycin, but it is crucial to identify the source of the infection to provide targeted treatment and prevent the spread of infection.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure. He was previously intubated and is now showing improved respiratory status following extubation. However, he has slow to improve mental status and absence of positive cultures following most recent cultures. This may represent improving sepsis, respiratory failure, and delirium all proceeding in parallel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has been identified with coag negative staph species, but negative cultures over the past three days. He is still on Vancomycin and may require a change to addition of Gentamicin, which will be discussed with the ID team. Alternative sources are not clearly identified.
2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient's Hct levels have decreased, indicating a potential ongoing blood loss.
3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is slow to improve, indicating possible ongoing neurological issues.
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 11]): Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk of acute respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrest: There is no mention of cardiac arrest in the current situation.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD is present, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless man w h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented
   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.
   Persistent bacteremia with coag negative staph.
   .
   #1 Coag Negative Staph Bacteremia:  Most recent positive cultures from
   [**12-27**]. .  Sensitivities show 2 different morphologies, sensitive to
   vanc but MIC = 2.  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] is likely source of Coag
   neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations seen
   on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo.  Still no clear source for positive blood
   cultures, however were likely from PICC line, now removed.  Per
   radiology, no thrombus in veins, no arterial pseudoanerysms.
   - cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   - continue to check surveillance cultures.
   - appreciate ID recs
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clear, CXR clear.  Oxygenating well on nc.  Respiratory
   distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn doses and
   with nebulizer treatments. Not requiring many PRN nebs
   - Prednisone with 40mg today with long taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 150mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - f/u psych recs
   - increase Seroquel to 150mg PO TID today due to multiple PRN doses
   received last night
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - regimen is Amlodipine 5mg PO qday, Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork done by medical team, SW working
   with family

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, and homelessness. He presented with shortness of breath, likely a COPD exacerbation, but left against medical advice (AMA). The patient experienced cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed due to a pneumothorax (PTX). The chest tubes were subsequently removed, and the patient was extubated. 

The patient has been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia, with positive cultures from 12-27. He was initially sensitive to vancomycin, but with a MIC of 2, it is considered resistant. The source of the infection was likely the PICC line, which has been removed. The patient remains afebrile, and no vegetations were seen on echocardiograms. 

The patient also has issues with respiratory failure, altered mental status, anemia, hypertension, hypernatremia, CAD with a silent myocardial infarction, PTSD/bipolar disorder, hyperglycemia, and failed speech and swallow evaluation. 

The patient's family is involved in his care, and guardianship paperwork is being pursued. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress or further episodes of hypoxia due to underlying COPD and potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless man w h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented
   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.
   Persistent bacteremia with coag negative staph.
   .
   #1 Positive Blood Cultures with Coag negative staph:  Coag neg Staph
   [**12-27**], [**12-15**], [**12-17**], [**12-20**] (1 of 2 bottles
 2^nd showed no growth), and
   [**12-15**].    Neg x 2 on [**12-16**], no growth yet on from [**12-22**], [**12-23**], [**12-25**]
   blood cultures.  Sensitivities show 2 different morphologies, sensitive
   to vanc but MIC = 2.  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] is likely source of
   Coag neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations
   seen on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo. Staph from [**12-26**] sensitive to
   Vancomycin.  Still no clear source for positive blood cultures, however
   were likely from PICC line, now removed.
   - f/u final read of ultrasound for aneurysm in R femoral area
   - cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   - continue to check surveillance cultures.
   - ID consult for continued management, changing abxs or increased vanc
   dosing
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clearer today.  Oxygenating well on 4L nasal canula.
   Respiratory distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn
   doses and with nebulizer treatments. Not requiring many PRN nebs
   - taper Prednisone with 40mg today
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 150mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - psych consult on [**12-29**]
   - continue current Seroquel dose at 150mg PO BID today,  PRN is 25-50mg
   q8 hours
   - f/u psych recs for further management
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - regimen is Amlodipine 5mg PO qday, Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - increase free H2O flushes
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork done by medical team, SW working
   with family
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   - psych f/u

   # Hyperglycemia: Patient with BG 133-170 currently.

The patient subsequently experienced cardiac arrest twice and had bilateral chest tubes placed for pneumothorax (PTX). The chest tubes were eventually removed, and the patient was extubated.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:

1. Positive blood cultures with coag-negative staphylococci: The patient has persistent bacteremia with coag-negative staphylococci, despite being treated with vancomycin. Sensitivity testing shows that the organism is sensitive to vancomycin but with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2. The source of infection appears to be the previously removed PICC line. Further management is required, including continuing vancomycin and considering changing antibiotics or increasing the dosage.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with history of COPD now admitted initially with
   exacerbation of his underlying obstructive lung disease with hosptial
   course complicated by cardiac arrest, continued bacteremia, persistent
   ventilatory failure and altered mental status.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Chronic obstructive lung disease with acute
   exacerbation-
   -Reasonable improvement in ventilation outside of acute paroxysms of
   dyspnea, tachypnea and agiation which may or may not be primary
   respiratory trigger
   -Wean prednisone further 40mg/d
30mg/d if stable today
   2)Agitation/Altered Mental Status-Patient with reassuring
   -Seroquel dosing to continue
   -Thiamine
   -Patient moving all extremities with good strength
   -Likely background untreated psychiatric illness in addition to
   resolving ICU delirium
   3)Sepsis--No followed by persistent bacteremia.  We have discussed with
   ID team and will continue to Rx and search for possible persistent
   sources.
   -Blood cultures form 11/17/11/8 and [**12-31**] have been negative to date
   -Vanco to continue x 14 day course
   -Likely catheter tip source from past.
   -Will move to TEE for persistent positive cultures vs. empiric
   extension of antibiotic dosing duration
   -With encouraging neuro exam showing continued improvement in strength
   will pursue MRI only for change in neuro exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD who was initially admitted for an exacerbation of his underlying obstructive lung disease. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by cardiac arrest, continued bacteremia, persistent ventilatory failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 204/139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his weight has decreased from 79.4 kg at admission to 68.6 kg currently.

The patient has received various treatments and medications, including Vancomycin for bacteremia, Heparin sodium for prophylaxis, Lansoprazole (Prevacid), and Seroquel for agitation and altered mental status.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, there are elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and troponin-T. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Imaging shows improvement in pulmonary opacities on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive lung disease with acute exacerbation is causing respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless man w h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented
   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.
   Persistent bacteremia with coag negative staph.
   .
   #1 Coag Negative Staph Bacteremia:  Most recent positive cultures from
   [**12-27**]. .  Sensitivities show 2 different morphologies, sensitive to
   vanc but MIC = 2.  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] is likely source of Coag
   neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations seen
   on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo.  Still no clear source for positive blood
   cultures, however were likely from PICC line, now removed.  Per
   radiology, no thrombus in veins, no arterial pseudoanerysms.
   - cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   - continue to check surveillance cultures.
   - appreciate ID recs
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clear, CXR clear.  Oxygenating well on nc.  Respiratory
   distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn doses and
   with nebulizer treatments. Not requiring many PRN nebs
   - Prednisone with 40mg today with long taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 150mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - f/u psych recs
   - increase Seroquel to 150mg PO TID today due to multiple PRN doses
   received last night
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - regimen is Amlodipine 5mg PO qday, Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork done by medical team, SW working
   with family
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   - psych f/u
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient with BG 133-170 currently.
   -on low level standing glargine and regular insulin with sliding scale
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs.  Replete electrolytes
   PRN.  Failed speech and swallow eval but hope MS will improve over
   time.
   .
   # Access:  PIV, requesting PICC line
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, On PPI
   # Code:  FULL code, confirmed with brother & son, will revisit if
   status deteriorates.
   # Dispo:  call out to floor
   # Communication:  Brother = [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2269**] (Cell [**0-0-**]). Closest

   Social work spoke with [**Doctor Last Name 3062**] who would like to make medical decisions
   and pursue guardianship if necessary.  (see SW note).  Guardianship
   paperwork in progress. Guaridian needs to be legal guardian, not family
   because the guardian needs to be in-state.  Family will come in each
   weekend to visit.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to a COPD exacerbation. He was found to have bilateral pleural effusions (PTX) and underwent chest tube placement. The patient experienced cardiac arrest twice and had both chest tubes removed. He was extubated and his mental status improved over time. The patient has persistent bacteremia with coag-negative staphylococci, which is sensitive to vancomycin but with a MIC of 2. The source of infection was likely the PICC line, which has been removed. The patient has been afebrile, and no vegetations were seen on echocardiograms. The patient's respiratory distress is more related to agitation, which improves with Seroquel and nebulizer treatments. His altered mental status is improving with supportive care, and an MRI of the brain showed no significant anoxic brain injury or other causes for encephalopathy. The patient's anemia is stable, but he has a history of hypertension and was previously discharged on lisinopril and atenolol. His hypernatremia is being managed with free water boluses, and his hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M homeless man w h/o COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse who intially presented
   with SOB, likely COPD exacerbation, left AMA, now s/p cardiac arrest x
   2 with bilateral CTs removed for PTX.  Chest tube removed, pt
   extubated, mental status is depressed but seems to be improving.
   Persistent bacteremia with coag negative staph.
   .
   #1 Coag Negative Staph Bacteremia:  Most recent positive cultures from
   [**12-27**]. .  Sensitivities show 2 different morphologies, sensitive to
   vanc but MIC = 2.  PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] is likely source of Coag
   neg Staph.   Throughout, patient has been afebrile. No vegetations seen
   on [**12-22**] ECHO, [**12-29**] echo.  Still no clear source for positive blood
   cultures, however were likely from PICC line, now removed.  Per
   radiology, no thrombus in veins, no arterial pseudoanerysms.
   - cont. Vancomycin, restart 14 day course based on [**12-27**] BCx
   - continue to check surveillance cultures.
   - appreciate ID recs
   #2 SOB/Resp Failure: Patient had been protecting his own airway and was
   reintubated to have MRI studies on evening of [**12-22**].  He was
   successfully extubated [**12-26**] in the afternoon, with a good follow-up
   ABG.  Lungs are clear, CXR clear.  Oxygenating well on nc.  Respiratory
   distress related more to agitation, improves w/seroquel prn doses and
   with nebulizer treatments. Not requiring many PRN nebs
   - Prednisone with 40mg today with long taper
   - Continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with prn
   Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation
   #3 Altered Mental Status:
 Improving today with supportive care.  MRI
   of brain without evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other
   causes to explain encephalopathy.  [**Month (only) 51**] be a result of his critical
   illness and multiple medications that he has received.  Neurology is
   following.  B12 level normal.   Per family, pt. has bipolar disorder
   and has not taken medications that he was previously prescribed.  EEG
   and EMG unrevealing.  Seroquel 150mg PO BID and PRN.  Neurology
   recommended repeat MRI but patient unable to remain still w/out being
   sedated and in light of difficulty weaning patient from vent
   previously, is best to avoid re-intubation.
   - appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - f/u psych recs
   - increase Seroquel to 150mg PO TID today due to multiple PRN doses
   received last night
   # Anemia: Stable currently, but Hx stool guaiac +.
    -trend Hct
   - patient on PPI
   -transfuse if Hct <21 or patient symptomatic.
   #Hypertension: On reviewing old records, pt. has a history of HTN and
   was previously discharged from this institution on lisinopril and
   atenolol.  Thus, he likely has HTN at baseline and requires some
   medication for this.  HTN also corresponds to agitation.   Continue
   Captopril at 37.5 PO TID as his HTN is improved today.
   - regimen is Amlodipine 5mg PO qday, Captopril 37.5mg PO TID
   - Holding beta blocker as pt. is bradycardic at times, bronchospastic
   - No albuterol
   - Control agitation with seroquel
   #Hypernatremia:
   - continue free water boluses
   - follow Na w/am labs and adjust water flushes as appropriate.
   # CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction: s/p cardiac arrest and multiple
   shocks.
   - Add ASA
   - Hold B-blocker given intermittent bradycardia, bronchospasm
   - Consider statin.
   # Medical decision making:
   - Family (brother & son) visited patient this weekend and were
   encouraged by his progress.  They will try to have family visiting to
   help orient patient and provide a familiar face.
   - Pursing guardianship
 paperwork done by medical team, SW working
   with family
   - okay with PEG placement if deemed medically necessary.
   .
   # PTSD/bipolar disorder: Appears that he is not on medications as
   outpatient. Per family, has been seen in VA system.
   - psych f/u
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient with BG 133-170 currently.
   -on low level standing glargine and regular insulin with sliding scale
   .
   # FEN:  Pt. tolerating TFs per nutrition recs.  Replete electrolytes
   PRN.  Failed speech and swallow eval but hope MS will improve over
   time.
   .
   # Access:  PIV, requesting PICC line
   # PPx:  Heparin SC TID, bowel regimen, On PPI
   # Code:  FULL code, confirmed with brother & son, will revisit if
   status deteriorates.
   # Dispo:  call out to floor
   # Communication:  Brother = [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2269**] (Cell [**0-0-**]). Closest
   family member is oldest son [**Name (NI) 3062**].  [**Name2 (NI) 3062**] and [**Doctor Last Name **] both in [**Location (un) 3063**].
   Social work spoke with [**Doctor Last Name 3062**] who would like to make medical decisions
   and pursue guardianship if necessary.  (see SW note).  Guardianship
   paperwork in progress. Guaridian needs to be legal guardian, not family
   because the guardian needs to be in-state.  Family will come in each
   weekend to visit.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, asthma, EtOH abuse, who initially presented with shortness of breath (likely COPD exacerbation) and left against medical advice. He later experienced cardiac arrest twice with bilateral chest tubes removed for pneumothorax. The chest tube was eventually removed, and the patient was extubated.
- The patient has persistent bacteremia with coag-negative staph, most recent positive cultures from 12/27. Sensitivities show two different morphologies sensitive to vancomycin but MIC = 2. The PICC line tip removed on 12/23 is likely the source of coag-negative staph. The patient has been afebrile, and no vegetations were seen on echocardiograms.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, possibly due to agitation, but improves with Seroquel and nebulizer treatments. He is oxygenating well on NC. The plan is to continue atrovent nebs Q6H and xopenex nebs scheduled Q4H with PRN Q2H; no albuterol to avoid tachycardia and increased agitation.
- The patient's mental status has been depressed but seems to be improving. An MRI of the brain showed no evidence of significant anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain encephalopathy. The patient has bipolar disorder and has not taken medications prescribed in the past"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / COPD exacerbation:  He has been improving since IV steroid
   course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone taper.  He
   was transferred back to the ICU today for episode of agitation and
   concern for respiratory distress with ABG of 7.3/56/57/38.  He was
   given usual tx of nebulizers and seroquel which improved his status
   however the floor team was uncomfortable with managing on the floor
   -continue seroquel 150 TID  for agitation, consider uptitrating
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis Bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder as
   well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.
   -          continue seroquel
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  Likely [**3-15**] PICC line infection as
   PICC line tip removed [**12-23**] growing Coag neg Staph.  Last positive
   cultures were [**12-27**], all surveillance cultures neg since. He has had
   two TTE's on [**12-22**] and [**12-29**], which were negative for vegetations.
   Have not done TEE [**3-15**] severe COPD.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 14 day course after his last
   positive blood culture.
   -follow surveillance blood cultures
   -Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.
   - continue captopril, can switch to lisinopril
   - continue amlodipine
   - use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress
   - also, holding statin due to concern for myopathy
   - continue telemetry
    .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for over one week.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   ..
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN He failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**], continue with
   tube feeds via NGT for now, may require PEG.
   - repeat S&S in the next few days if mental status continues to
   improve
   - continue TF's
   .
   #Medical decision making: Given the patient's inability to communicate
   his own wishes, his son is currently pursuing guardianship. call

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complicated medical history including COPD, EtOH abuse, and previous hospitalizations.
- He was admitted with shortness of breath, left AMA, and experienced a seizure in the lobby followed by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The hospital course has been complicated by pneumothorax (PTX) requiring chest tubes, acute mental status changes (AMS), agitation, respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia.
- The patient's current medications include seroquel for agitation, xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers for COPD exacerbation, prednisone taper, vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia, lisinopril for hypertension, amlodipine, and aspirin.
- The patient's neurologic examination has shown abnormal reflexes, but imaging and EEG have not shown any explanation for persistent encephalopathy.
- The patient's mental status has improved with treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation.
- The patient has a history of alcoholic hepatitis, ETOH abuse, and is currently unable to communicate his own wishes, with his son pursuing guardianship.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of COPD exacerbation and the need for respiratory support indicate a potential for ongoing respiratory distress.

   .
   # Dyspnea / COPD exacerbation:  He has been improving since IV steroid
   course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone taper.  He
   was transferred back to the ICU today for episode of agitation and
   concern for respiratory distress with ABG of 7.3/56/57/38.  He was
   given usual tx of nebulizers and seroquel which improved his status
   however the floor team was uncomfortable with managing on the floor
   -continue seroquel 150 TID  for agitation, consider uptitrating
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday starting
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis Bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder as
   well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.
   -          continue seroquel
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive with
   unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   - would favor treating through [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access
   - appreciate ID input
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.
   - on Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday
   - use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.

   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complex medical history including COPD, EtOH abuse, and prior cardiac arrests. He was admitted with shortness of breath, left AMA, and experienced a seizure in the lobby. He had a hospital course complicated by pneumothorax (PTX) after chest tubes, acute mental status changes (AMS)/agitation, respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia.

Current assessment and plan:
1. Dyspnea/COPD exacerbation: The patient has been improving since receiving IV steroid treatment and is now stable on prednisone taper. He was transferred back to the ICU for an episode of agitation and concern for respiratory distress with an ABG of 7.3/56/57/38. He was given usual tx of nebulizers and seroquel which improved his status. He should continue seroquel 150 TID for agitation, consider uptitrating, continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers, and continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday starting tomorrow morning.
2. Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: The patient's altered mental status may be due to an underlying psychiatric diagnosis (Bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder) as well as superimposed delirium caused by long ICU stay, bacteremia, intubation, and IV steroids. He had an MRI brain without evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain encephalopathy. He should continue seroquel and appreciate psych input.
3. Coag-negative staph Bacteremia: New cultures from [**1-2**] positive with unclear source. He has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2 (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess. The patient would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without re-intubation. He should continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive blood culture, and appreciate ID input.
4. Hypertension: Prior to this admission, the patient was on lisinopril and atenolol, and his blood pressure improved on the current regimen although he does become very hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel. He should be on Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday, and use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
5. Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note, he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was normal. He should appreciate neuro recs and monitor mental status and neuro exam.
6. s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was unremarkable. He should continue aspirin, beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress, continue telemetry, and monitor for any further cardiac events.
7. ETOH abuse: Unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels on day of event. He should continue folate, thiamine, MVI, and monitor for any signs of withdrawal symptoms.
8. History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on check [**2104-12-4**]. Monitor liver function tests and assess for any signs of alcoholic hepatitis.
9. FEN: He failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**], continue with tube feeds via NGT for now, may require PEG. Appears that he is likely at a new baseline and concern for little improvement from here. Will continue to assess and address with family.

- Glycemic control: Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin infusion as needed.
- Lines: PICC Line - [**2105-1-2**] 01:25 PM

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / COPD exacerbation:  He has been improving since IV steroid
   course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone taper.  He
   was transferred back to the ICU today for episode of agitation and
   concern for respiratory distress with ABG of 7.3/56/57/38.  He was
   given usual tx of nebulizers and seroquel which improved his status
   however the floor team was uncomfortable with managing on the floor
   -decrease seroquel to 100 TID  for agitation b/c of episode of
   somnolence last night.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday starting
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis Bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder as
   well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.
   -          continue seroquel
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive with
   unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   - would favor treating through [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access
   - appreciate ID input
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.
   - on Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday: follow BP, if too
   low w/10 of lisinopril, consider decreasing dose (not 1:1dosing with
   captopril).
   - use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam

   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress
   - continue telemetry
    .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / COPD exacerbation:  He has been improving since IV steroid
   course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone taper.  He
   was transferred back to the ICU today for episode of agitation and
   concern for respiratory distress with ABG of 7.3/56/57/38.  He was
   given usual tx of nebulizers and seroquel which improved his status
   however the floor team was uncomfortable with managing on the floor
   -continue seroquel 150 TID  for agitation, consider uptitrating
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday starting
   tomorrow morning
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis Bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder as
   well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy.
   -          continue seroquel
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive with
   unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   - would favor treating through [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access
   - appreciate ID input
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.
   - on Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday
   - use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress
   - continue telemetry
    .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for over one week.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   ..
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN He failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**], continue with
   tube feeds via NGT for now, may require PEG.  Appears that he is likely
   at a new baseline and concern for little improvement from here.  Will
   continue to assess and address with family.
   .
   #Medical decision making: Given the patient's inability to communicate
   his own wishes, his son is currently pursuing guardianship. call

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of prolonged hospital stay for respiratory failure, PEA arrest, and bilateral pneumothoraces. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a coag-negative staph bacteremia being treated through the infection due to poor response. He has no known drug allergies and is currently on several medications including heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and xopenex. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 140/89 mmHg to 161/108 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,518 mL and output of 1,805 mL. His weight has decreased from 79.4 kg to 68.6 kg during his hospital stay. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilary region with diminished breath sounds. He has absent pulses in both lower extremities and is unable to stand. Neurological assessment is not performed. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.5 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.05 mg/dL, low hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and elevated lactate level of 28.2%. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection due to coag-negative staph bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and decreased peripheral pulses.
4. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and decreased skin perfusion.
5. Malnutrition and poor glycemic control due to inadequate nutritional support and stress from illness.

Please note that these are potential complications and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a prolonged hospital stay for respiratory failure, PEA arrest, and bilateral pneumothoraces. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient has a history of COPD and is currently being treated with steroids, albuterol, and inhaled corticosteroids. He also has a coag-negative staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin through the PICC line.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/89 mmHg to 161/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His temperature is within normal range.

Physical examination findings include crackles in the bibasilary region of the chest, diminished breath sounds, and absent pulses in both lower extremities. Neurological examination was not performed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory distress and previous respiratory failure indicates a risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The presence of coag-negative staph bacteremia could lead to sepsis, especially considering the patient's compromised immune system due to prolonged"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / COPD exacerbation:  He has been improving since IV steroid
   course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone taper,
   though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea, wheezing,
   belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually occur at
   night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and resolve
   with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU from the
   floor for similar episodes.  This morning he was moving more air in his
   lungs than usual and stated that he was comfortable.  Previous episodes
   have demonstratred normal ABGs.
   -cont. lower dose of seroquel 100 mg TID  b/c of episode of somnolence
   on [**1-4**].
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday then 20 mg
   qday starting [**1-8**]
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          continue seroquel
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive with
   unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    Vanco dose has been increased, will recheck level.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   - would favor treating through [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access
   - appreciate ID input
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.
   - on Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday: follow BP, if too
   low w/10 of lisinopril, consider decreasing dose (not 1:1dosing with
   captopril).
   - use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress
   - continue telemetry
    .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for a few weeks.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   ..
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN:  failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**]; Dubhoff placed
   [**1-5**]; Passed swallow eval on [**1-6**]: start with ground solids (due to
   lack of teeth) and thin liquids, 1:1 with foods to watch for aspiration
   and CXR on [**1-8**].  Cont. TF for now until patient can take adequate POs
   and it is clear that the patient is not aspirating.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including COPD, EtOH abuse, and a recent hospital course complicated by pneumonia, AMS (altered mental status), respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia. He has been transferred back to the MICU due to recurrent episodes of dyspnea/COPD exacerbation, altered mental status/bipolar disorder, coag-negative staph bacteremia, hypertension, abnormal neuro exam, s/p cardiac arrest, ETOH abuse, history of alcoholic hepatitis, and failure of speech and swallow evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/COPD exacerbation: The patient continues to experience daily episodes of tachypnea, wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis, which can lead to increased respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: The patient's underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar disorder, along with superimposed delirium due to ICU stay, bacteremia, intubation, and IV steroids, may contribute to continued altered mental status. Close monitoring and appropriate psychotropic medications are necessary to manage these symptoms.
3. Coag-negative staph Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing bacteremia with unclear source. Increasing the dose of vancomycin and completing a 6-week course after the last positive blood culture is recommended. It is important to identify the source of infection and"

   low w/10 of lisinopril, consider decreasing dose (not 1:1dosing with
   captopril).
   - use seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress
   - continue telemetry
    .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for over one week.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI

   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on

   # FEN He failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**], continue with
   tube feeds via NGT for now, may require PEG.  Appears that he is likely
   at a new baseline and concern for little improvement from here.  Will
   continue to assess and address with family. Needs repeat S&S now that
   mental status has improved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a complex medical history including COPD, EtOH abuse, and previous hospitalizations. He was admitted with shortness of breath and had a seizure in the lobby, leading to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia with pleural effusion requiring chest tubes, acute mental status changes, respiratory distress, and coag-negative staphylococcal bacteremia.

The patient's current medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other medications. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 98/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea and agitation. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential complications:

1. Dyspnea/COPD exacerbation: The patient has been improving since receiving an IV steroid course, but now requires close monitoring due to an episode of agitation and concern for respiratory distress. He will continue using nebulizers and seroquel, and his prednisone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of respiratory failure, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and a complicated hospital course. He presented with respiratory distress, which was resolved with Seroquel. He has no known drug allergies and has been receiving various medications including Lansoprazole, Heparin Sodium, glargine/SSI, zonpenex, norvasc, thiamine, prevacid, asa, atrovent, lisinopril, prednisone, and seroquel. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 92 to 144 mmHg, heart rate between 87 and 122 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 to 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination revealed wheezes on respiratory auscultation and absent peripheral pulses. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient also has deranged electrolytes and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COPD and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is still confused, and the cause of his delirium is unclear. The patient's guardianship paperwork is pending,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of respiratory failure, PEA arrest, and a complicated hospital course. He presented with respiratory distress, which resolved with the use of Seroquel. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently on various medications including glargine/SSI, zonpenex, norvasc, thiamine, prevacid, ASA, atrovent, lisinopril, prednisone, and seroquel.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/56 mmHg to 201/125 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient has lost weight since admission.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

Medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to COPD and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), delirium potentially caused by anoxic brain injury, and possible infection indicated by the presence of coag-negative staph in the microbiology report."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Last night he had one such
   episode that resolved with 2 PRN doses of 50mg of Seoquel and 1 dose of
   1mg of Ativan.  This morning he was not moving air well but that is
   likely due to the fact that he was due to have a nebulizer treatment.
   Previous episodes have demonstratred normal ABGs.
   -Considering Seroquel dose was lowered two days ago and prns were
   needed, will increase am and qhs seroquel doses t o150mg and f/u
   w/psych recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday then 20 mg
   qday starting [**1-8**]
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac

   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.  On
   Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday

   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was

   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.

   distress. To consider re-starting today or tomorrow if patient is
   tachycardic/if bp allows.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / COPD exacerbation:  He has been improving since IV steroid
   course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone taper,
   though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea, wheezing,
   belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually occur at
   night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and resolve
   with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU from the
   floor for similar episodes.  This morning he was moving more air in his
   lungs than usual and stated that he was comfortable.  Previous episodes
   have demonstratred normal ABGs.
   -cont. lower dose of seroquel 100 mg TID  b/c of episode of somnolence
   on [**1-4**].
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday then 20 mg
   qday starting [**1-8**]

   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old man with severe COPD who was admitted with an exacerbation and complicated by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has required multiple interventions and medications.

The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress last night and required multiple doses of Seroquel to reduce agitation. He is currently sedated and responsive only to pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 86/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished pulses in both lower extremities and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient has muscle wasting and is unable to stand. Neurological examination is limited due to sedation.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, hypertension, and ethanol abuse. He is currently on lisinopril for hypertension, but it is being held due to low blood pressure. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to exacerbation"

   CXR: NAD, picc catheter now migrated out of SVC and up into neck veins
   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Last night he had one such
   episode that resolved with 2 PRN doses of 50mg of Seoquel and 1 dose of
   1mg of Ativan.  This morning and last he was not moving air well but
   that is likely due to the fact that he was due to have a nebulizer
   treatment.  Previous episodes have demonstratred normal ABGs.
   -Considering Seroquel dose was lowered three days ago and although
   increased yesterday prns were needed, will increase doses to
   200/150/200 w/25mg PRNs (with total of 800mg daily MAX) and f/u w/psych
   recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday then 20 mg
   qday starting [**1-8**]
   .
   #2 Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          continue seroquel  at increased doses.
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #3 Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive
   with unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    Vanco dose has been increased, will recheck level.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   -appreciate ID input
   -will replace picc with one in other arm tomorrow (in IR) if BCx from
   [**1-4**] still pending or turns positive
   -if additional BCx come back positive after PICC replaced, team would
   favor treating through [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.  On
   Amlodipine 5mg PO qday.  BP was relatively low w/10mg of Lisinopril,
   decreased to 5mg Lisinopril PO and BPs have been stable.
   - use Seroquel PRN for hypertension associated with episodes of
   agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress. To consider re-starting today or tomorrow if patient is
   tachycardic/if bp allows.
   .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for a few weeks.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN:  failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**]; Dubhoff placed
   [**1-5**]; Passed swallow eval on [**1-6**]: start with ground solids (due to
   lack of teeth) and thin liquids, 1:1 with foods to watch for aspiration
   and CXR on [**1-8**].  Cont. TF for now until patient can take adequate POs
   and it is clear that the patient is not aspirating.  CXR today was
   normal
   -f/u CXR tomorrow.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including COPD, EtOH abuse, who was admitted with shortness of breath and later experienced a seizure, cardiac arrest, and subsequent hospital course complicated by pneumonia, acute mental status changes, respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia.

The patient's current medical issues include dyspnea/respiratory distress, altered mental status/bipolar disorder, coag-negative staph bacteremia, hypertension, abnormal neuro exam, s/p cardiac arrest, ETOH abuse, history of alcoholic hepatitis, and failed speech and swallow evaluation.

Treatment and management plans include increasing the doses of seroquel for agitation, continuing xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers, slow prednisone taper, vancomycin for coag-negative staph bacteremia, monitoring mental status and neuro exam, considering restarting beta-blocker, continuing folate, thiamine, and MVI, starting with ground solids and thin liquids due to failed speech and swallow evaluation, and pursuing guardianship for medical decision-making.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, persistent encephalopathy, recurrent bacteremia, uncontrolled hypertension, further neurologic deterioration, and potential aspiration due to failed speech and swallow evaluation.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   # Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Last night he had one such
   episode that resolved with 2 PRN doses of 50mg of Seoquel and 1 dose of
   1mg of Ativan.  This morning he was not moving air well but that is
   likely due to the fact that he was due to have a nebulizer treatment.
   Previous episodes have demonstratred normal ABGs.
   -Considering Seroquel dose was lowered two days ago and prns were
   needed, will increase am and qhs seroquel doses t o150mg and f/u
   w/psych recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday then 20 mg
   qday starting [**1-8**]
   .
   # Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          continue seroquel  at increased am and qhs doses.
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive with
   unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    Vanco dose has been increased, will recheck level.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   -appreciate ID input
   -will replace picc with one in other arm
   -if additional BCx come back positive, would favor treating through
   [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access\
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.  On
   Lisinopril 10mg PO qday, Amlodipine 5mg PO qday
   - BP has been relatively low w/10mg of Lisinopril, can decrease to 5mg
   Lisinopril PO.
   - use Seroquel for hypertension associated with episodes of agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress. To consider re-starting today or tomorrow if patient is
   tachycardic/if bp allows.
   .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for a few weeks.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   ..
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN:  failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**]; Dubhoff placed
   [**1-5**]; Passed swallow eval on [**1-6**]: start with ground solids (due to
   lack of teeth) and thin liquids, 1:1 with foods to watch for aspiration
   and CXR on [**1-8**].  Cont. TF for now until patient can take adequate POs
   and it is clear that the patient is not aspirating.  CXR today was
   normal
   -f/u CXR tomorrow.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complicated medical history including COPD, EtOH abuse, admitted with shortness of breath, left AMA, and had a seizure in the lobby, followed by PEA arrest. He was transferred back to the MICU due to respiratory distress and coag-negative staph bacteremia.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been improving on an IV steroid course, but continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea, wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis at night. These episodes resolve with nebs and seroquel.
- His mental status has improved with treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation.
- He has positive cultures for coag-negative staph bacteremia, with unclear source. Extensive workup has been done, including TTE, LENIs, and MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess. The patient would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE without re-intubation.
- His blood pressure improved on the current regimen, but he becomes hypertensive during episodes of agitation, which resolves with seroquel. His current medications include Lisinopril 10mg PO qday and Amlodipine 5mg PO qday.
- His neuro exam has improved with treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation.
- He had a cardiac arrest with unknown cause, possibly related to a seizure. He underwent cooling protocol and his head CT after"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Last night he had one such
   episode that resolved with 2 PRN doses of 50mg of Seoquel and 1 dose of
   1mg of Ativan.  This morning and last he was not moving air well but
   that is likely due to the fact that he was due to have a nebulizer
   treatment.  Previous episodes have demonstratred normal ABGs.
   -Considering Seroquel dose was lowered three days ago and although
   increased yesterday prns were needed, will increase doses to
   200/150/200 w/25mg PRNs (with total of 800mg daily MAX) and f/u w/psych
   recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 30mg PO qday then 20 mg
   qday starting [**1-8**]
   .
   #2 Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          continue seroquel  at increased doses.
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #3 Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive
   with unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    Vanco dose has been increased, will recheck level.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 6-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   -appreciate ID input
   -will replace picc with one in other arm tomorrow (in IR) if BCx from
   [**1-4**] still pending or turns positive
   -if additional BCx come back positive after PICC replaced, team would
   favor treating through [**Last Name **] problem of poor venous access
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.  On
   Amlodipine 5mg PO qday.  BP was relatively low w/10mg of Lisinopril,
   decreased to 5mg Lisinopril PO and BPs have been stable.
   - use Seroquel PRN for hypertension associated with episodes of
   agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress. To consider re-starting today or tomorrow if patient is
   tachycardic/if bp allows.
   .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for a few weeks.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN:  failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**]; Dubhoff placed
   [**1-5**]; Passed swallow eval on [**1-6**]: start with ground solids (due to
   lack of teeth) and thin liquids, 1:1 with foods to watch for aspiration
   and CXR on [**1-8**].  Cont. TF for now until patient can take adequate POs
   and it is clear that the patient is not aspirating.  CXR today was
   normal
   -f/u CXR tomorrow.
   .
   #Medical decision making: Given the patient's inability to communicate
   his own wishes, his son is currently pursuing guardianship. call

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complicated medical history including COPD, EtOH abuse, who was admitted with shortness of breath and later experienced a seizure, PEA arrest, and subsequent hospital course complicated by pneumothorax, acute mental status changes, respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia.
- The patient has been experiencing episodes of respiratory distress, characterized by tachypnea, wheezing, and diaphoresis, which usually occur at night and resolve with nebs and seroquel.
- His mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and confusion, likely due to underlying psychiatric conditions and superimposed delirium.
- The patient had a positive blood culture for coag-negative staph bacteremia, but the source of infection is unclear. He has undergone extensive workup including TTE, LENIs, and MRI of the head and C-spine, which did not reveal any abscesses.
- His blood pressure has been relatively stable on the current regimen, although he becomes hypertensive during episodes of agitation.
- The patient's neuro exam has shown abnormalities, but imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for persistent encephalopathy. However, with treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation, his mental status has begun to improve.
- The patient is scheduled for a swallow evaluation and has been placed on a Dubhoff tube due to failed speech and swallow evaluation."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Previous episodes have
   demonstratred normal ABGs.  Decreased respiratory distress overnight on
   new, increased standing dose of seroquel
   -Cont. trial of Seroquel 200/150/200 w/25mg PRNs (with total of 800mg
   daily MAX) and f/u w/psych recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 20 mg qday (then 10 mg
   qd x 3 days, then 5 mg
   .
   #2 Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          continue seroquel  at increased doses.
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #3 Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive
   with unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    No further cultures have come back positive, so [**1-2**] be a contaminate.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 2-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   -will keep PICC line in for now as patient has poor access.
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.  On
   Amlodipine 5mg PO qday.  BP was relatively low w/10mg of Lisinopril,
   decreased to 5mg Lisinopril PO and BPs have been stable.
   - use Seroquel PRN for hypertension associated with episodes of
   agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress. To consider re-starting today or tomorrow if patient is
   tachycardic/if bp allows.
   .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for a few weeks.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
   # FEN:  failed a speech and swallow evaluation on [**12-31**]; Dubhoff placed
   [**1-5**]; Passed swallow eval on [**1-6**]: start with ground solids (due to
   lack of teeth) and thin liquids, 1:1 with foods to watch for aspiration
   and CXR on [**1-8**].  Cont. TF for now until patient can take adequate
   POs.  Patient is unable to eat by himself as he lacks the motor
   coordination to do so.
   Would like to avoid PEG tube placement as patient would likely not have
   wanted that and given his respiratory status may require intubation for
   PEG placement.
   .
   #Medical decision making: Given the patient's inability to communicate
   his own wishes, his son is currently pursuing guardianship. call

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic. He has a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anxiety, and anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient's recent events include increased standing seroquel to match prns in an effort to decrease the number of respiratory distress episodes. Seroquel is now dosed at 200/150/200 with 25-50mg Q6h, with a max 24h total seroquel dose of 800mg. The patient's PICC line was pulled back. He has been very active in the evening, trying to get out of bed. It is necessary to call psych today if continued problems with agitation and somnolence with seroquel are observed.

- Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications such as pneumonia or further exacerbation of COPD.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immobility and invasive lines, he is at an increased risk for developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers, especially in vulnerable areas like the sacrum and heels.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be a complication in critically ill patients.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a risk of hypotension due to fluid shifts or medication effects.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if there is ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with severe COPD, PEA arrest, and prolonged hospitalization. He has been experiencing periodic agitation but improved after increasing the dose of seroquel. The patient is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, lantis, prednisone, vancomycin, atrovent, zopenex, thiamine, norvasc, prevacid, asa, colace, lisinopril, and seroquel. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/70 mmHg to 151/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is as follows: alert and oriented x 1, very sleepy currently but earlier did PT for 1 hour, not attentive, not follows simple commands, responds to not assessed, movement not assessed, tone not assessed. The patient's blood lab results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, blood glucose, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. However, the patient has elevated levels of AST, ALT, lactate acid, LDH, and slightly decreased albumin level. The patient's coagulation profile shows an INR of 1.2 and P"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Previous episodes have
   demonstratred normal ABGs.  Decreased respiratory distress overnight on
   new, increased standing dose of seroquel
   -Cont. trial of Seroquel 200/150/200 w/25mg PRNs (with total of 800mg
   daily MAX) and f/u w/psych recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -continue xopenex and ipratropium nebulizers
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 20 mg qday (then 10 mg
   qd x 3 days, then 5 mg
   .
   #2 Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder:  Reason Most likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          continue seroquel  at increased doses.
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #3 Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  New cultures from [**1-2**] positive
   with unclear source.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2
   (most recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess
   for aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    No further cultures have come back positive, so [**1-2**] be a contaminate.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 2-week course after last positive
   blood culture
   -will keep PICC line in for now as patient has poor access.
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive w/agitated episodes, which resolves w/seroquel.  On
   Amlodipine 5mg PO qday.  BP was relatively low w/10mg of Lisinopril,
   decreased to 5mg Lisinopril PO and BPs have been stable.
   - use Seroquel PRN for hypertension associated with episodes of
   agitation.
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress. To consider re-starting today or tomorrow if patient is
   tachycardic/if bp allows.
   .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a complicated medical history including COPD, EtOH abuse, and previous hospitalizations. He was admitted with shortness of breath, left AMA, and experienced a seizure in the lobby followed by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has had a hospital course complicated by pneumothorax (PTX) after chest tubes, altered mental status (AMS), respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia. The patient's current condition is stable with controlled respiratory status on prednisone taper, but he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea, wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: The patient's episodes of respiratory distress may recur, particularly at night when he is awakened for nursing interventions or lab draws. Monitoring his response to nebs and seroquel will be important.

2. Altered Mental Status/Bipolar Disorder: The patient's AMS may persist due to underlying psychiatric diagnosis or superimposed delirium. Continued use of increased doses of seroquel and psych input are recommended.

3. Coag-negative Staph Bacteremia: The source of the bacteremia is unclear, and the patient has had extensive workup without evidence of abscess. Completion of a 2-week course of vancomycin is planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with chronic obstructive lung disease now with prolonged ICU
   course complicated by recurrent bacteremia, respiratory failure and
   altered mental status.  He now has had continued good stability post
   extubation and with slow to improve mental status.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -O2 to wean as tolerated
   -Continue with inhaled bronchodilators (Atrovent/Xopenex)
   -Prednisone completed today
   -OOB and ambulate as tolerated
   2)Altered Mental Status--Very tenuous balance.  Patient at baseline has
   been reported to be agitated and combative.  Have worked to try to
   establish baseline level of medication to allow patient activity and
   minimization of excess sedation while continuing to allow him active
   participation in care.
   -Seroquel--increase evening dosing--200mg q pm
   -PRN use during the day
   -Thiamine po
   -Psychiatry input essential
Underlying bipolar disorder
   3)Sepsis-->Bactermia
   -Vanco to continue with goal of two week course for bacteremia
   following negative cultures which have been reassuring

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has had a prolonged ICU course complicated by recurrent bacteremia, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient has shown stability post-extubation but continues to have a slow improvement in mental status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated, continuing with inhaled bronchodilators, and ambulating as tolerated.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is being managed with Seroquel at an increased evening dosage of 200mg qpm and PRN use during the day. Thiamine is also being administered, and psychiatry input is essential due to underlying bipolar disorder.
3. Sepsis/Bacteremia: Vancomycin is being continued for a two-week course for bacteremia following negative cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
2. Altered mental status (not delirium)
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/Doctor's Last Name)
4. Cardiac arrest
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation
6. Alteration in nutrition
7. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other
8. Anxiety
9. Hypertension, benign

ICU Care:
The patient's nutrition is being provided through Fibersource HN (Full) at 80 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained using regular insulin sliding scale. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin and stress ulcer prevention with PPI. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo M transferred back to the MICU with complicated PMH including
   COPD, EtOH abuse admitted with SOB, left AMA and had a seizure in
   lobby, with PEA arrest with subsequent hospital course complicated by
   PTX s/p chest tubes, AMS/agitation, respiratory distress and coag
   negative staph bacteremia.  Now extubated, periodically having anxiety
   leading to tachypnea and fininishing course of Abx for bacteremia,
   screening for rehab.
   .
   #1 Dyspnea / Respiratory Distress:  He had been improving throughout IV
   steroid course and now with stable respiratory status on prednisone
   taper, though he continues to have daily episodes of tachypnea,
   wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis.  These episodes usually
   occur at night when he is awakened by nursing for bed turns or labs and
   resolve with nebs and seroquel.  He was transferred back to the ICU
   from the floor for similar episodes.  Previous episodes have
   demonstratred normal ABGs.  Decreased respiratory distress overnight on
   new, increased standing dose of seroquel
   -Cont. Seroquel w/25mg PRNs (with total of 800mg daily MAX) and f/u
   w/psych recommendations RE treating agitation.
   -switch to albuterol and ipratropium MDIs
   -continue slow prednisone taper with Prednisone 20 mg qday (then 10 mg
   qd x 3 days, then 5 mg
   .
   #2 Altered Mental Status/Bipolar disorder: Acutely this a.m. most
   likely [**3-15**] large doses of seroquel o/n for agitation o/n which was at
   one point him trying to crawl out of bed.  Chronic likely due to
   underlying psychiatric diagnosis, bipolar vs schizoaffective disorder,
   as well as superimposed delirium [**3-15**] long ICU
   stay/bacteremia/intubation/IV steroids.  He had MRI brain without
   evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes to explain
   encephalopathy that was performed a couple of weeks after his cardiac
   arrest.  Due to this interval time period, the team does not feel that
   a second MRI would be beneficial or suggest alternative causes for
   continued AMS.  Additionally, patient would need to be re-intubated for
   MRI.
   -          Decrease PRN doses of seroquel
   -          Clarify  that PRN seroquel is to be used for anxiety and
   tachypnea not
agitation
 (agitation has many meanings)
   -          appreciate psych input
   .
   #3 Coag negative staph Bacteremia:  Last + culture was on [**1-2**] and
   had same resistance panel, likely same infection rather than
   contaminant.  Has had extensive workup in the past with TTE X 2 (most
   recent [**12-29**]), LENIs with imaging of femoral arteries to assess for
   aneurysm, MRI of head and C-spine without evidence of abscess.  Pt
   would not tolerate repeat MRI or TEE at this point without
   re-intubation.    No further cultures have come back positive, so [**1-2**]
   represents last positive surveillance culture for now and would treat
   for 14 days past this.
   -continue vancomycin to complete a 2-week course after [**1-2**] ([**1-15**])
   -Attempted PICC change but PICC nurse unable to place on opposite side,
   would withdrawl PICC and resite vs. tx w/ linezolid PO if unable to
   resite.
   .
   # Hypertension: prior to this admission was on lisinopril and atenolol,
   blood pressure improved on current regimen although he does become very
   hypertensive/tachycardic w/ anxious/tachypnic episodes, which resolves
   w/seroquel.  On Amlodipine 5mg PO qday.  BP was relatively low w/10mg
   of Lisinopril, decreased to 5mg Lisinopril PO and BPs have been stable.
   - use Seroquel PRN for hypertension associated with episodes of
   anxiety/tachypnea
   .
   # Abnormal neuro exam: Imaging and EEG have shown no explanation for
   persistent encephalopathy and abnormal reflexes. However, with
   treatment for bacteremia and seroquel for agitation with improvement in
   mental status, the patient's neuro exam has begun to improve. Of note,
   he did have an EMG that was concerning for polyneuropathy. B12 was
   normal.
   - No recent neuro recs
   - monitor mental status and neuro exam
   . .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause unknown, a seizure may have been a
   component of the initial picture given his unresponsiveness, abnormal
   movements, and incontinence. Per his family, he has had cardiac arrests
   in the past. He is now s/p paralysis and sedation for the cardiac
   arrest cooling protocol. He was started on an amiodarone gtt which has
   since been d/c'd. He had a head CT after he was rewarmed that was
   unremarkable.
   - continue aspirin
   - beta blocker is being held due to COPD exacerbation and respiratory
   distress.
   .
   # ETOH abuse: unknown history of withdrawal seizures or DTs. Arrest may
   have been due to withdrawal seizure given timing to serum etoh levels
   on day of event.   Has been off benzo
s now for a few weeks.
   -continue folate, thiamine, MVI
   .
   # History of alcoholic hepatitis: No LFTs in many years, but normal on
   check [**2104-12-4**].
   .
# FEN: passed  a speech and swallow evaluation on [**1-6**] reccomendations were: 1.
 PO diet: ground solids, thin liquids 2. PO meds: crushed in puree 3. 1:1 superv
ision with PO to maintain aspiration precautions and assist with self-feeding.
4. Nutrition f/u re: NGT feedings
5. If there are further concerns for aspiration either clinically
by RN or objectively by CXR, please place videoswallow study
order for further objective assessment of swallow function.
- Nutrition consult for calorie count and if sufficient would pull dopoff

   #Dispo: Appropriate for rehab. Screening in progress. Transfer to floor

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of COPD, EtOH abuse, and previous hospital course complicated by PTX, AMS, respiratory distress, and coag-negative staph bacteremia. He was admitted with shortness of breath and subsequently experienced a seizure followed by PEA arrest. After resuscitation, he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He had a prolonged ICU stay and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, which was treated with IV steroids and antibiotics. He also had episodes of anxiety and agitation, for which he was given seroquel. The patient's respiratory status has improved on prednisone taper, but he still experiences daily episodes of tachypnea, wheezing, belly breathing, and diaphoresis. These episodes occur mainly at night and resolve with nebs and seroquel. He was transferred back to the ICU from the floor for similar episodes. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to an underlying psychiatric diagnosis, such as bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder, as well as superimposed delirium caused by long ICU stay, bacteremia, intubation, and IV steroids. An MRI brain showed no evidence of anoxic brain injury or other causes for encephalopathy. The patient also has a history of alcoholic hepatitis and EtOH abuse. He is currently being treated for coag-negative staph bacteremia and has completed a 2-week course of vancomycin. His blood"
