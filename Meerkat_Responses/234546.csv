","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease and systolic and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted with acute on chronic heart failure and transferred to the CCU for hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes flash pulmonary edema, aspiration event, possible mucus plug, and pulmonary embolism. She is experiencing mild respiratory distress, tremulousness in the upper extremities, and crackles bilaterally in the chest. The patient also has anasarca, diffuse 2+ pitting edema, and widespread wet and wavy skin folds. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium and magnesium levels, and elevated liver enzymes. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. HYPOXIA: The patient may have flash pulmonary edema or aspiration event as the likely etiologies. She is currently maintaining oxygen saturation on BiPAP but desats rapidly when the BiPAP is removed. The chest X-ray appears fluid overloaded. The plan includes continuing furosemide (Lasix) gtt bolus with a goal diuresis of 75 to 100 cc per hour, continuing nitroglycerin gtt, considering CVL and inotrope to encourage diuresis, considering CVVH, and following up with CX data.

   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 yo female with DM1, extensive cardiac hx including CAD,
   systolic and diastolic HF, admitted with acute on chronic HF and
   transferred to the CCU for hypoxia.
   # HYPOXIA: Flash pulmonary edema vs. aspiration event top 2 likely
   etiologies. Per transfer assessment, mucus plus and PE also are
   possibilities. Overnight, pt was started on BiPAP. Currently,
   maintaining sats on BiPAP; however, noted to desat rapidly when BiPAP
   is removed. CXR appears fluid overloaded.
   - continue lasix gtt bolus with goal diuresis of 75 to 100 cc per hr
   - continue nitro gtt
   - consider CVL and inotrope to further encourage diuresis; could also
   consider CVVH
   - f/u cx data; continue broad coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - continue CE
s for a third set
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - consider intubation if respiratory status does not improve
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC HF: On furosemide drip as
   above. Per floor team, her edema has improved with diuresis, although
   she remains grossly overloaded on exam.
   - lasix gtt as above
   - continue losartan and metoprolol; continue spironolactone (of note,
   not able to get PO meds at this time [**3-8**] BiPAP)
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - as above, consider inotrope assistance vs. CVVH
   # Delirium:  Pt with history of agitation and delirium, responsive to
   Zyprexa. This agitation likely exacerbates her respiratory
   difficulties. Psych following.

   metoprolol
   - Trending cardiac markers as above
   # HTN: Normotensive this morning.
   - Cont metoprolol and losartan
   - Nitro gtt will also help
   # Monoclonal spike: Has monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, ? if underlying
   myeloma. There has been some mention of amyloid in prior notes this

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 59-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease, systolic and diastolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with acute on chronic heart failure and transferred to the critical care unit for hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with flash pulmonary edema versus aspiration event as the top two likely etiologies. The patient has been started on BiPAP and is maintaining oxygen saturation, but desats rapidly when the BiPAP is removed. Her chest X-ray appears fluid overloaded. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is at risk of continued desaturation episodes, which may require intubation if respiratory status does not improve.
2. Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient remains grossly overloaded on examination despite diuresis, indicating ongoing fluid accumulation and potential worsening of heart failure.
3. Delirium: The patient has a history of agitation and delirium, which can exacerbate respiratory difficulties and should be monitored and managed with appropriate medications.
4. Coronary artery disease: Although stable at present, there is a risk of recurrent ischemic events, and cardiac markers should be trended.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and thyroid function should be monitored.
6. Diabetes: The"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic and diastolic heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted with acute-on-chronic HF and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxia. 

In the ICU, she has been started on BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) for respiratory support. However, she desaturated rapidly when the BiPAP mask was removed. Her chest X-ray shows fluid overload. 

She is currently on several medications, including lasix (furosemide) for diuresis, nitroglycerin for cardiac support, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl) for suspected sepsis. 

Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on BiPAP. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 yo female with DM1, extensive cardiac hx including CAD,
   systolic and diastolic HF, admitted with acute on chronic HF and
   transferred to the CCU for hypoxia.
   # HYPOXIA: Precipitant not entirely clear. Crackles and CXR consistent
   with flash edema, although no clear trigger such as hypertension or
   tachycardia. Aspiration event also possible given h/o this, as well as
   mild leukocytosis and fever. Other causes include mucus plug (no
   secretions, so unlikely), PE (possible, but patient not currently
   stable for V/Q and would address above issues first). ABG suggests
   profound A-a gradient, given PaO2 of 64 on NRB.
   - Low threshold for BiPAP if hypoxia persists or worsens
   - Furosemide 80mg IV bolus and continue gtt to maintain 100ml/hr UOP
   - Start NTG gtt for acute pulmonary edema
   - Broad-spectrum abx in case of HAP including aspiration: vancomycin,
   cefepime, metronidazole
   - Cycle cardiac markers to evaluate for ischemia
   - Send blood and urine cultures given fevers
   - Repeat CXR in am
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC HF: On furosemide drip,
   managing acute component as above under hypoxia. Per floor team, her
   edema has improved with diuresis, although she remains grossly
   overloaded on exam.
   - Furosemide gtt as above
   - Cont losartan and metoprolol
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes while diuresing
   - Considerations if she becomes refractory to diuretics include
   inotropic support or CVVH.
   - Continue spironolactone 25 mg PO/NG DAILY
   # Delirium:  Pt with history of agitation and delirium, responsive to
   Zyprexa. This agitation likely exacerbates her respiratory
   difficulties. Psych following.
   - Cont zyprexa 2.5mg QHS and PRN, monitor QTc with daily EKG
   - Cont traZODONE 25 mg PO/NG HS
   - F/u psych recs
   # CAD:  Stable, no evidence of active ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin 81 mg, simvastatin 80 mg daily, plavix 75 mg,
   metoprolol
   - Trending cardiac markers as above
   # HTN: Remains around recent baseline of SBP 140.
   - Cont metoprolol and losartan
   - Nitro gtt will also help
   # Monoclonal spike: Has monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, ? if underlying
   myeloma. There has been some mention of amyloid in prior notes this
   admission.
   - No acute interventions, will speak with her floor team tomorrow to
   understand any established plans for this
   # DIABETES:
   - Continue glargine plus HISS
   - Cont gabapentin for neuropathy
   # DEPRESSION/ANXIETY:
   - Cont fluoxetine 60 mg PO/NG DAILY
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM:
   - Cont levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 59-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic and diastolic heart failure (HF), who was admitted with acute on chronic HF and transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for hypoxia. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, agitation, fever, and crackles bilaterally in her chest. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 75-92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/58 mmHg to 170/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm. She is on various medications including furosemide, metoprolol, vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and zyprexa.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's profound A-a gradient suggests severe oxygenation impairment, which may be due to pulmonary edema, aspiration, or another underlying cause. Immediate interventions such as low threshold for BiPAP, furosemide bolus, NTG gtt, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's cardiac condition is being managed with furosemide gtt, losart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has acute on chronic heart failure with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and low left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 40%). These cardiac issues may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and potential cardiogenic shock.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient is on non-invasive ventilation and has been intubated. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the presence of a pneumothorax and subsequent chest tube placement indicates a respiratory complication that required intervention.

3. Renal complications: The patient's renal function is compromised as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels. This could be due to acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to sepsis or hypoperfusion. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting medications accordingly is crucial to prevent further renal deterioration.

4. Infection: The patient has positive MRSA nasal swab and pleural fluid analysis is positive for lights criteria but overall looks like transudate. This suggests a possible infection, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture results.

5. Bleeding complications: The patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin sodium for prophylaxis. This"

   baseline following failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis
   with lasix gtt on admission, transferred to the unit for acute
   worsening of dyspnea .
   Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial, may be [**3-8**] TR with PFO resulting in right to left shunt
   with unsat blood to left sided circulation leading to hypoxia.
   Intrinsic pulmonary disease also a possibility given severe PHTN (PE,
   mucous plugging, atelectasis, parenchymal disease).  [**Month (only) 60**] also be some
   small component of pulmonary edema although not supported by
   hemodynamics.
   Pt responded well to fluid bolus when hypotensive suggesting that she
   is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca.
   Agitation also plays a role with patient desating to 80s from 90s when
   agitated (a catecholamine surge could lead to increased PHTN leading to
   increased RA pressure which if with PFO leads to left shunt).

   I agree with the detailed note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 11929**] delineated in her note
   on [**2118-4-23**].
   History and Physical.   I agree with the documentation of the history
   and physical examination.  I concur with the treatment plan outlined
   above.
   Medical Decision Making.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old woman transferred to
   the CCU for respiratory observation and management of her pulmonary
   hypertension and congestive heart failure.   She has a long history of
   pulmonary hypertension (primary cause unknown but may be related to a
   connective tissue disease), s/p ICD placement with resultant TR
   (annular ring dimension is normal), and a 40 pound weight within the
   hospital.   Currently, her cardiac index is low and we will support her
   as needed with milrinone and ginger fluid boluses.    A PA in place for
   fluid statue monitoring.

   on:[**2118-4-23**] 16:13 ------
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which is a known risk factor for right heart failure. The presence of severe TR (tricuspid regurgitation) and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension suggests that the patient may be experiencing right-sided heart failure.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings indicate acute-on-chronic systolic and diastolic CHF. This condition can lead to fluid overload, hypoxemia, and further deterioration of cardiac function.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and the need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS. This is a serious complication characterized by acute lung injury and impaired gas exchange.

4. Infective Endocarditis: The patient has a history of intravenous drug use, which increases the risk of infective endocarditis. The presence of a monoclonal spike on SPEP raises the possibility of an underlying myeloma, which can be associated with infective endocarditis.

5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR) suggest possible liver dysfunction. This could be due to right-sided heart failure, sepsis, or other underlying liver diseases.

6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. This could be related to pre-existing chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury secondary to sepsis, hypotension, or other factors.

7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly the low sodium and potassium, indicate an electrolyte imbalance. This can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and the presence of risk factors such as pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.

9. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and poor tissue perfusion increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular turning and skin assessment are essential to prevent this complication.

10. Delirium: The patient's agitation and fluctuating mental status suggest delirium. This is common in critically ill patients and requires appropriate management with medications and environmental modifications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and address these potential complications promptly to improve outcomes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type I, cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization, pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis, anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient presented to the hospital with significant weight gain (50 pounds above baseline), acute worsening of dyspnea, and was subsequently transferred to the ICU for further management.

Key findings from the note include:
1. Thoracentesis performed with removal of 1.3L pleural fluid, which was exudative in nature.
2. Pleural fluid analysis showed lights criteria suggestive of exudative effusion, but other lab values were more consistent with transudate.
3. Pneumothorax resulted from the thoracentesis, and a chest tube was placed to suction.
4. Swan-Ganz catheter placement with hemodynamics indicating elevated CVP, RAP, and PCWP.
5. The patient demonstrated severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on echocardiogram, along with severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Troponins peaked at 0.13, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of depression, type I diabetes mellitus, and chronic anemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has undergone several procedures, including thoracentesis, cordis/introducer placement, and non-invasive ventilation. She has also been started on various medications such as Lasix, diuril, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 72/24 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 13 mmHg. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is at 43%, indicating decreased tissue perfusion.

The patient's respiratory support includes non-rebreather mask and CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 666 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 100%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history and current condition can be summarized as follows:

- The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM1), torsades de pointes post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient presented with acute worsening of dyspnea and was admitted to the hospital 50 pounds above her baseline weight following a failed diuresis at rehab. She was transferred to the ICU for further management.
- The patient has a complex medical history, including depression, anxiety, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and hypertension, for which she is receiving multiple medications.
- Upon admission, the patient was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension, and subsequent investigations revealed a pneumothorax resulting from a thoracentesis procedure. A chest tube was placed to suction.
- The patient's pleural fluid analysis showed positive lights criteria, indicating an exudative process.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- Her hemodynamics have been unstable, with elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery pressures ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, torsades de pointes after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above her baseline weight following failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis with lasix gtt on admission, and transferred to the unit for acute worsening of dyspnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may have multifactorial hypoxia, possibly due to tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with patent foramen ovale (PFO) resulting in right-to-left shunt and unsaturated blood to the left-sided circulation, intrinsic pulmonary disease, or pulmonary edema.
2. Acute on chronic systolic/diastolic CHF: The patient has been diuresed with lasix gtt over hospitalization, but remains grossly overloaded on exam. Diuresis has been complicated by difficulty with positioning without patient experiencing extremis.
3. Ischemia: The patient's troponins are slightly elevated and trending up, which suggests possible ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization, pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis, anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and multiple admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital with significant weight gain and worsening dyspnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be due to several factors such as flash pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, mucous plugging, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Acute on chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently experiencing worsening symptoms. Diuretics have been administered, but the patient remains overloaded with edema. Close monitoring and adjustments to the treatment plan are necessary.

3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are slightly elevated and rising, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Further investigation with an EKG and other diagnostic tests may be required to confirm this.

4. Delirium: The patient has a history of agitation and delirium, which responded to zyprexa. It is important to continue managing her psychiatric symptoms while addressing her respiratory distress.

5. Diabetes management: The patient"

   Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial, may be [**3-8**] TR with PFO resulting in right to left shunt
   with unsat blood to left sided circulation leading to hypoxia.
   Intrinsic pulmonary disease also a possibility given severe PHTN (PE,
   mucous plugging, atelectasis, parenchymal disease).  [**Month (only) 60**] also be some
   small component of pulmonary edema although not supported by
   hemodynamics.
   Pt responded well to fluid bolus when hypotensive suggesting that she
   is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca.
   Agitation also plays a role with patient desating to 80s from 90s when
   agitated (a catecholamine surge could lead to increased PHTN leading to
   increased RA pressure which if with PFO leads to left shunt).

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of depression, type I diabetes mellitus, anemia, chronic kidney disease, and multiple admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital with significant weight gain, acute worsening of dyspnea, and hypoxia. The patient has undergone several procedures, including thoracentesis, chest tube placement, and a Swan-Ganz catheter placement. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with non-rebreather oxygen and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient had a large pleural effusion that required thoracentesis and subsequent chest tube placement due to pneumothorax as a complication of the procedure.
2. Acute heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of systolic and diastolic CHF, which may be exacerbated by her current presentation.
3. Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN): The patient has severe PHTN, which could be contributing to her hypoxia and right-to-left shunt.
4. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR): The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows severe TR, likely contributing to her symptoms.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient has persistent hypoxemia, which may be due to the aforementioned causes or intrinsic pulmonary disease.
6. Renal dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of depression, diabetes mellitus type I, and chronic anemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of heart failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic, on a chronic basis.

The patient's 24-hour events include being on a humidified mask, agitation at 7:30 pm, saturation levels improving to the low 90s with non-rebreather, and no changes observed on the repeat chest X-ray. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2 of 73, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's hemodynamics indicate a decreased cardiac index (CI) and poor urine output (UOP). She was given a milrinone infusion to increase UOP and achieve a CI greater than 2. However, the patient continued to have poor UOP, so she received a normal saline (NS) fluid bolus of 250cc and D51/2 NS to correct hypernatremia. The patient's sodium level at midnight was 150, and her potassium level was 4.1.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and sulfonamides. Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. She is currently receiving infusions of milrin"

   left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac cath
   complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic CHF, CKD and
   several admissions over the last few months for acute heart failure,
   delirium and aspiration pna admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above
   baseline following failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis
   with lasix gtt on admission, transferred to the unit for acute
   worsening of dyspnea .
   Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial, may be [**3-8**] TR with PFO resulting in right to left shunt
   with unsat blood to left sided circulation leading to hypoxia.
   Intrinsic pulmonary disease also a possibility given severe PHTN (PE,
   mucous plugging, atelectasis, parenchymal disease).  [**Month (only) 60**] also be some
   small component of pulmonary edema although not supported by
   hemodynamics.
   Pt responded well to fluid bolus when hypotensive suggesting that she
   is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca.
   Agitation also plays a role with patient desating to 80s from 90s when
   agitated (a catecholamine surge could lead to increased PHTN leading to
   increased RA pressure which if with PFO leads to left shunt).

","The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, torsades de pointes post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic anemia, and several admissions over the last few months for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above baseline following failed diuresis at rehabilitation, with continued diuresis with Lasix gtt on admission, transferred to the unit for acute worsening of dyspnea.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, heart failure, and anasarca. Hypoxia may be multifactorial, possibly due to tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with patent foramen ovale (PFO) resulting in right-to-left shunt with unsaturated blood to left-sided circulation leading to hypoxia. Intrinsic pulmonary disease is also a possibility given severe pulmonary hypertension (PE, mucous plugging, atelectasis, parenchymal disease). Small component of pulmonary edema is not supported by hemodynamics. The patient responded well to fluid bolus when hypotensive, suggesting intravascular dryness despite massive anasarca.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, torsades de pointes after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic anemia, and several admissions over the last few months for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above baseline following a failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis with lasix gtt on admission. She was transferred to the unit for acute worsening of dyspnea.

The patient responded well to a fluid bolus initially when hypotensive, suggesting that she is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca. She has been experiencing agitation, desaturation to 80s from 90s, and has been on a non-rebreather mask. Repeat chest X-ray showed no change. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, HCO3 of 73 mEq/L, BE of -24 mEq/L, and O2 sat of 93%. Hemodynamics showed a decrease in cardiac index (CI) and poor urine output (UOP), so milrinone was started. Despite the increase in CI, UOP remains poor, with rising creatinine and hypernatremia worsening.

Physical examination revealed non-rebreather mask, improved respiratory status compared to yesterday evening, no jugular venous distention (JVD), rales bilaterally, and diffuse 2+ pitting edema. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (Plt), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T levels. Other lab results indicated electrolyte imbalances including hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient has poor end-organ perfusion as evidenced by low urine output and rising creatinine levels.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which may be multifactorial including possible tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with patent foramen ovale (PFO) causing right-to-left shunt, intrinsic pulmonary disease, or pulmonary edema.
3. Acute on chronic systolic/diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of CHF and is currently experiencing acute exacerbation.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): Troponin levels are slightly elevated, suggesting possible CAD.
5. Delirium: The patient has a history of agitation/delirium responsive to zyprexa, and agitation exacerbates respiratory distress.

   Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial, may be [**3-8**] TR with PFO resulting in right to left shunt
   with unsat blood to left sided circulation leading to hypoxia.
   Intrinsic pulmonary disease also a possibility given severe PHTN (PE,
   mucous plugging, atelectasis, parenchymal disease).  [**Month (only) 60**] also be some
   small component of pulmonary edema although not supported by
   hemodynamics.
   Pt responded well to fluid bolus initially  when hypotensive suggesting
   that she is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca.
   Agitation also plays a role with patient desating to 80s from 90s when
   agitated (a catecholamine surge could lead to increased PHTN leading to
   increased RA pressure which if with PFO leads to left shunt). CI was
   below 2 though suggesting cardiogenic shock so she was started on
   milrinone. Cardiac index is above 2 although UOP as measure of end
   organ perfusion remains poor, with Cr and hypernatremia worsening.

   Medical Decision Making.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old woman transferred to
   the CCU for respiratory observation and management of her pulmonary
   hypertension and congestive heart failure.   She has a long history of
   pulmonary hypertension (primary cause unknown but may be related to a
   connective tissue disease), s/p ICD placement with resultant TR
   (annular ring dimension is normal), and a 40 pound weight within the
   hospital.   She had an additional episode of unresponsiveness and
   hypoxemia this morning that has resolved.  We will try high dose
   corticosteroids empirically and obtain a NO trial to assess
   reversibility of the pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of depression, diabetes mellitus type I, and chronic anemia. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute-on-chronic heart failure, presenting with symptoms such as hypoxemia, altered tissue perfusion, and fluid overload.

24-hour events:
- The patient was placed on a humidified mask and showed agitation at 7:30 pm.
- Sat's improved slowly to low 90s with non-rebreather.
- Repeat chest X-ray showed no change.
- ABG results showed pH 7.41, PaCO2 37, PaO2 73, and O2 saturation 93%.
- Hemodynamics showed a decrease in cardiac index (CI) and other parameters.
- The patient was started on milrinone to increase urine output (UOP), initially at 20cc/hr and later increased to 0.5 mcg/kg/hr.
- UOP remained poor, so the patient received a 250cc NS fluid bolus and D51/2 NS to correct hypernatremia, resulting in a net positive fluid balance of approximately 2L.
- The patient's sodium level at midnight was 150, and D5 was given at 150.
- Discussion with family regarding the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) was held, but it was decided to wait and observe the patient's eating before proceeding.
- Midnight potassium level was 4.1.
- Some atrial tach on telemetry was noted, and electrolytes were repleted.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) + bubble study was planned for Monday.
- The patient's allergies include penicillins and sulfa medications.
- The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 04/23/2118 at 12:00 PM, cefepime on 04/23/2118 at 11:37 PM, and metronidazole on 04/24/2118 at 02:00 AM.
- The patient is currently receiving milrinone infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
- Other ICU medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis) started on 04/23/2118 at 09:16 PM, and metoprolol started on 04/24/2118 at 02:56 AM.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Flow sheet data as of 04/24/2118 08:03 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and other parameters.
- Physical examination revealed the patient wearing a BiPAP mask, with improved respiratory status compared to yesterday evening. No other significant findings were noted.
- Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased lactate levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o woman with hx DM1, Torsades s/p ICD, pulmonary hypertension,
   left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac cath
   complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic CHF, CKD and
   several admissions over the last few months for acute heart failure,
   delirium and aspiration pna admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above
   baseline following failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis
   with lasix gtt on admission, transferred to the unit for acute
   worsening of dyspnea .
   # Hypotension / Pressor Requirement: Swan catheter showing numbers c/w
   sepsis picture (low SVR, high CO, high CI). Urine growing Klebsiella
   that is resistant to cefepime. Pt started on meropenem last night
   (cefepime stopped).
   - continue meropenem at this point; will need ID approval
   - does not seem likely that patient has C.diff, as one assay was
   negative and pt
s diarrhea has slowed down; will stop flagyl and PO
   vanco
   - continue to f/u culture data
   - continue phenylephrine, weaning as tolerated
   # Acute on chronic systolic/diastolic CHF/TR: Echo shows severe TR.
   Pacer wire naturally causes TR, but also see valve leaflets unable to
   fully coapt. Given pt
s sepsis-like picture, it does not seem prudent
   to further diurese at this point.
   - no further diuresis at this point
   - holding antihypertensives in the setting of pressor requirement
   - continue steroids
   .
   # Monoclonal spike: monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, ? if underlying
   myeloma. Mention of amyloid in prior notes this admission. Of note has
   exudative pattern on thoracentesis.
   - f/u pleural fluid analysis.
   .
   # CAD: Troponins slightly elevated, flat.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, plavix
   - holding metoprolol, as above
   .
   # Delirium: Hx agitation/delirium responsive to zyprexa. Psych
   following along and recommended increasing her zyprexa dosing.
   - not a current active issue as pt is sedated on ventilator
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine/HISS
   -continue gabapentin for neuropathy
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: fluoxetine 60mg daily
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine

   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s).  [**Name (NI) 9565**] dated [**2118-4-25**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Significantly worse today with profoundly septic physiology.  There is
   continued decrement in hemodynamic status.  Plan for discussion with
   family regarding goals of care given grave prognosis.
   ADDENDUM:  After discussion with the family, and description of her
   condition with anuric renal failure, respiratory failure, septic shock
   with very little improvement over the last 24 hours and continued
   decline, in fact, the decision was made to pursue comfort measures.
   Time spent discussion code status and managing hypotension critical
   care 50 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, cardiac issues, and kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU for acute heart failure and respiratory problems. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with hypotension, sepsis-like picture, resistant Klebsiella infection, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis with a low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), high cardiac output (CO), and high cardiac index (CI). This could lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. She has coarse ventilated breath sounds bilaterally and an arterial blood gas (ABG) indicating respiratory acidosis.
3. Tricuspid Regurgitation: The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation as seen on echocardiogram. This can lead to right-sided heart failure and fluid accumulation in the body.
4. Infection: The patient has a Klebsiella infection that is resistant to cefepime. She is currently being treated with meropenem. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance and further complications if the infection spreads.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, which means she is not producing urine. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o woman with hx DM1, Torsades s/p ICD, pulmonary hypertension,
   left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac cath
   complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic CHF, CKD and
   several admissions over the last few months for acute heart failure,
   delirium and aspiration pna admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above
   baseline following failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis
   with lasix gtt on admission, transferred to the unit for acute
   worsening of dyspnea .
   Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial, may be [**3-8**] TR with PFO resulting in right to left shunt
   with unsat blood to left sided circulation leading to hypoxia.
   Intrinsic pulmonary disease also a possibility given severe PHTN (PE,
   mucous plugging, atelectasis, parenchymal disease).  [**Month (only) 60**] also be some
   small component of pulmonary edema although not supported by
   hemodynamics.
   Pt responded well to fluid bolus initially  when hypotensive suggesting
   that she is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca.
   Agitation also plays a role with patient desating to 80s from 90s when
   agitated (a catecholamine surge could lead to increased PHTN leading to
   increased RA pressure which if with PFO leads to left shunt). CI was
   below 2 though suggesting cardiogenic shock so she was started on
   milrinone. Cardiac index is above 2 although UOP as measure of end
   organ perfusion remains poor, with Cr and hypernatremia worsening.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, torsades de pointes post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and several admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above baseline following a failed diuresis at rehab and was transferred to the ICU for acute worsening of dyspnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may have hypoxia due to a right-to-left shunt caused by a patent foramen ovale (PFO) resulting in unsaturated blood entering the left-sided circulation. Intrinsic pulmonary disease could also be a possibility, and there might be a small component of pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac index is below 2, indicating cardiogenic shock. She was started on milrinone, a vasodilator and inotrope.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be due to poor end-organ perfusion as indicated by a rising creatinine level.
4. Acute on Chronic Systolic/Diastolic CHF: The patient has severe"

   that she is intravascularly dry despite massive anasarca.
   Agitation also plays a role with patient desating to 80s from 90s when
   agitated (a catecholamine surge could lead to increased PHTN leading to
   increased RA pressure which if with PFO leads to left shunt). CI was
   below 2 though suggesting cardiogenic shock so she was started on
   milrinone. Cardiac index is above 2 although UOP as measure of end
   organ perfusion remains poor, with Cr and hypernatremia worsening.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, torsades de pointes post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), pulmonary hypertension, left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac catheterization, anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and multiple admissions for acute heart failure, delirium, and aspiration pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above her baseline weight following a failed diuresis at rehabilitation, with continued diuresis with lasix on admission. She was transferred to the unit for acute worsening of dyspnea.

The patient's hypoxia may be multifactorial, possibly due to a right-to-left shunt caused by a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or intrinsic pulmonary disease such as pulmonary embolism, mucous plugging, atelectasis, or parenchymal disease. There may also be a small component of pulmonary edema, although this is not supported by hemodynamics.

The patient responded well to a fluid bolus initially, suggesting intravascular dryness despite massive anasarca. Agitation also plays a role in respiratory distress. The patient's cardiac index is below 2, indicating cardiogenic shock, so she was started on milrinone. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o woman with hx DM1, Torsades s/p ICD, pulmonary hypertension,
   left main thrombosis with cardiac arrest during cardiac cath
   complicated by anoxic brain injury, systolic and diastolic CHF, CKD and
   several admissions over the last few months for acute heart failure,
   delirium and aspiration pna admitted to the hospital at 50 pounds above
   baseline following failed diuresis at rehab, with continued diuresis
   with lasix gtt on admission, transferred to the unit for acute
   worsening of dyspnea .
   # Hypotension / Pressor Requirement: Swan catheter showing numbers c/w
   sepsis picture (low SVR, high CO, high CI). Urine growing Klebsiella
   that is resistant to cefepime. Pt started on meropenem last night
   (cefepime stopped).
   - continue meropenem at this point; will need ID approval
   - does not seem likely that patient has C.diff, as one assay was
   negative and pt
s diarrhea has slowed down; will stop flagyl and PO
   vanco
   - continue to f/u culture data
   - continue phenylephrine, weaning as tolerated
   # Acute on chronic systolic/diastolic CHF/TR: Echo shows severe TR.
   Pacer wire naturally causes TR, but also see valve leaflets unable to
   fully coapt. Given pt
s sepsis-like picture, it does not seem prudent
   to further diurese at this point.
   - no further diuresis at this point
   - holding antihypertensives in the setting of pressor requirement
   - continue steroids
   .
   # Monoclonal spike: monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, ? if underlying
   myeloma. Mention of amyloid in prior notes this admission. Of note has
   exudative pattern on thoracentesis.
   - f/u pleural fluid analysis.
   .
   # CAD: Troponins slightly elevated, flat.
   - continue aspirin, simvastatin, plavix
   - holding metoprolol, as above
   .
   # Delirium: Hx agitation/delirium responsive to zyprexa. Psych
   following along and recommended increasing her zyprexa dosing.
   - not a current active issue as pt is sedated on ventilator
   .
   # Diabetes: Continue glargine/HISS
   -continue gabapentin for neuropathy
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: fluoxetine 60mg daily
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
