   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2368**] is an 84 yo F w/diverticulosis transferred from medical
   floor for estimated 1L of BRBPR, HCT of 22 most likely [**1-9**] diverticular
   bleeding.
   .
   #BRBPR - most likely [**1-9**] diverticular bleeding given reported h/o
   diverticulosis, other possible sources of bleeding include AVM vs
   polyp/tumor.  Upper GI bleed is also possible although very unlikely
   given hemodynamic stability.  All of prior care has been at [**Hospital1 49**] so
   limited records at this time.  She was transfused 2 units PRBC with one
   additional unit hanging at the time of transfer.
   -continue with tranfusion, goal HCT >28
   -to IR for tagged red cell scan this evening
   -serial HCT's q6
   -2 large bore IV's for access
   -has three crossmatched units available
   -NG lavage if any concern for UGIB
   -f/u GI reccs
   .
   #Periorbital Edema - appearance c/w histamine reaction, concerning for
   tranfusions reaction although would be strange for reaction to be so
   localized as she had no other signs of systemic transfusion reaction.
   Other possiblity could be localized reaction [**1-9**] chemical irritation.
   Much improved after one dose of benadryl.
   -benadryl 12.5 prn
   -monitor s/s
   .
   #Dementia/Delirium - has baseline dementia per floor team but has
   become increasingly agitated over the course of the day as her BRBPR
   has progressed. According to her HCP, she has h/o of increased
   agitation while hospitalized.
   -continue to transfuse
   -monitor mental status
   .
   #? Arrhythmia - unclear history but is on amiodarone and metoprolol at
   baseline, HR currently well controlled
   -hold metoprolol give acute bleeding
   -continue amiodarone given unknown arrhythmia
   .
   # HTN - holding antihypertensives given acute GI bleeding
   -hold metoprolol, lisinopril
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   .
   #CHF
 according to her niece she has a history of heart failure with
   IVF/resuscitation during prior hospitalizations.  Currently appears
   hypovolemic to euvolemic.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or elevated
   JVP on exam.
   -transfuse prn
   -monitor volume status
   .
   #FEN - continue w/IVF/PRBC as needed, replete lytes prn, NPO for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis who presented to the hospital with an estimated 1L of blood in the rectum per rectal bleeding, and a hematocrit level of 22. She was transferred from the medical floor to the ICU due to suspected diverticular bleeding. The patient has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells and has additional units hanging. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/56 to 185/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral periorbital edema and conjunctival injection, but no other facial edema or rash. The neck is supple with a flat jugular venous pressure. The cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with a soft 2/6 systolic murmur. Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally without wheezing or crackles. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness, normal bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding. There are no extremity edemas or deformities, and the distal pulses are palpable bilaterally.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.8"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis, who presented with an estimated 1 liter of blood in the rectum per rectal bleeding, and a hemoglobin concentration of 22. She was transferred from the medical floor to the ICU for further management. The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), with one additional unit hanging at the time of transfer. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/56 to 185/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral periorbital edema and conjunctival injection, but no facial edema or rash. Her abdomen is soft with no rebound or guarding. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 197 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, slightly elevated potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, and normal liver function tests. The patient's blood products balance is positive at 293 mL, and she has received a total of 593 mL of blood products. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Diverticular bleeding: The patient is most likely experiencing diverticular bleeding, given her history of diverticulosis. Other possible sources of bleeding include arteriovenous malformation (AV"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis who was transferred to the ICU for an estimated 1L of blood red brown pudding rectal bleeding (BRBPR) and a hematocrit (HCT) of 22. The likely cause of the bleeding is diverticular bleeding, although other possibilities include arteriovenous malformation (AVM), polyp/tumor, or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission and is currently being transfused with an additional unit. The plan is to continue transfusion, aim for a HCT greater than 28, and prepare the patient for endoscopy if necessary. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli and is being treated with ceftriaxone. She has a history of dementia, periorbital edema possibly due to a transfusion reaction or chemical irritation, and is on amiodarone and metoprolol for an unknown arrhythmia. Antihypertensives are being held due to acute GI bleeding. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure (CHF), and is euvolemic with scattered crackles on exam. She will be monitored closely and fluid administration will be cautious. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and arrhythmia. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on Saturday. The source of bleeding could not be identified in the intensive care unit (ICU), and since then, her hematocrit (Hct) level has been drifting down. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and has been started on ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has no known drug allergies. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/62 to 149/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but does not require supplemental oxygen. Her physical examination reveals that she is thin, with normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings. Neurological examination is not assessed. 

Laboratory results show a Hct level of 31.4%, white blood cell count within normal limits, platelet count of 197 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 106 mg/dL, and normal electrolyte levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
An 84-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation presented to the ICU with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). She received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and underwent a tagged red blood cell scan. The source of bleeding could not be identified, and her hematocrit (Hct) has been drifting down since then. She has been hemodynamically stable and started on ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI). Her allergies are unknown. She is currently on multiple medications including protonix, calcium carbonate, levoxyl, amiodarone, and CTX. There are no significant changes in her medical, social, or family history, as well as her review of systems, except for confusion and agitation at times.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and arrhythmia. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and received a tagged red blood cell scan, leading to the transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient was unable to undergo an intestinal angiogram due to cessation of bleeding, so the source of bleeding could not be identified. Since then, her hematocrit (HCT) has been drifting down. The patient has been hemodynamically stable and was started on ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has no known drug allergies. Her current medications include protonix, calcium carbonate, levothyroxine, amiodarone, and ceftriaxone.

24-Hour Events:
The patient has been hemodynamically stable, with vital signs within normal range. She has been on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilation. Her urine output has been within normal limits. There have been no significant changes in her medical or family history, review of systems, or physical examination.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs have remained relatively stable throughout her stay in the ICU, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate between 62-84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/62-149/81 mmHg,"

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2368**] is an 84 yo F w/diverticulosis transferred from medical
   floor for estimated 1L of BRBPR, HCT of 22 most likely [**1-9**] diverticular
   bleeding.
   .
   #BRBPR
 Localized to sigmoid colon on tagged rbc scan but bleeding d/c
   by time patient went to angiography, so no intervention performed..
   Most likely [**1-9**] diverticular bleeding given reported h/o
   diverticulosis, other possible sources of bleeding include AVM vs
   polyp/tumor.  She has received a total of 6 units PRBC since admission,
   including 1 U last night after what appeared to be passage of stool
   from prior bleed.  Patient had a medium-sized melanic stool late
   morning of [**11-1**]
 likely residual blood from her prior bleed.  Plan
   for IR intervention if repeated BRBPR (no need to repeat tagged RBC
   scan).  If hct slowly trends downward, will prep and scope patient.
   - transfusion as needed, goal HCT >28
   -serial HCT's Q8
   -2 large bore IV's for access
   -has one crossmatched unit available currently
   -NG lavage if any concern for UGIB
   -f/u GI recs,
   -f/u colorectal surgery recs
   .
   # Urinary Tract Infection: Urine grossly opaque and UA indicative of
   UTI.  Now growing E. coli.  Treating with ceftriaxone pending
   sensitivities.
   .
   #Dementia/Delirium - According to her HCP, she has h/o of increased
   agitation while hospitalized.  UTI and acute blood loss may also be
   contributing.  Delerium seems improved today
   -continue to transfuse
   -treat UTI as above
   -monitor mental status
   .
   #Periorbital Edema - appearance c/w histamine reaction, concerning for
   tranfusions reaction although would be strange for reaction to be so
   localized as she had no other signs of systemic transfusion reaction.
   Other possiblity could be localized reaction [**1-9**] chemical irritation.
   Much improved after one dose of benadryl.
   -benadryl 12.5 prn
   -monitor s/s
   .
   #? Arrhythmia - unclear history but is on amiodarone and metoprolol at
   baseline, HR currently well controlled
   -hold metoprolol give acute bleeding
   -continue amiodarone given unknown arrhythmia
   .
   # HTN - holding antihypertensives given acute GI bleeding. Bleeding has
   resolved and BP now in 150
   -Start home lasix, then metoprolol, then lisinopril.  Advance meds
   slowly throughout day vs some tomorrow based on BP tolerance of
   previous med.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   .
   #CHF
 according to her niece she has a history of heart failure with
   IVF/resuscitation during prior hospitalizations.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.  Scattered crackles on exam today, but no elevated JVP.
   Will monitor and avoid large fluid boluses.
   -transfuse prn
   -monitor volume status
   .
   #FEN - continue w/IVF/PRBC as needed, replete lytes prn, Regular diet.
   If Hct trends down, keep NPO after midnight for GI to scope tomorrow.
   .
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # Dispo: Hct stable, can call out to floor today.

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis, who was admitted to the ICU for an estimated 1L of blood loss per rectum with a hemoglobin concentration of 22. She has been experiencing multiple episodes of melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of bleeding was localized to the sigmoid colon on a tagged red blood cell scan but was not treated due to the patient going directly for angiography. She has received a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells since admission, including one unit last night after a suspected passage of stool from prior bleeding. The patient also has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which is being treated with ceftriaxone. Her mental status has improved today, but she may still be experiencing delirium or dementia. She has periorbital edema, which could be due to a transfusion reaction or chemical irritation. This has improved after one dose of Benadryl. The patient's history is unclear regarding arrhythmia, but she is currently on amiodarone and metoprolol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. He had an episode of melena during the day, and his hematocrit dropped. The patient was transfused with one unit of blood, and his hematocrit is now at 37.8. The gastrointestinal team believes the bleeding is likely due to retained stool from an earlier bleed and has ordered a tagged red blood cell scan. However, they have decided to proceed directly with angiography, as they do not believe an additional nuclear study is necessary.

The patient has also been diagnosed with an E. coli infection in his urinary catheter and has been started on ceftriaxone. He has no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/60 mmHg to 153/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 27.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 34.0%, platelet count of 133 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 111 mg/dL"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2368**] is an 84 yo F w/diverticulosis transferred from medical
   floor for estimated 1L of BRBPR, HCT of 22 most likely [**1-9**] diverticular
   bleeding.
   .
   #BRBPR - most likely [**1-9**] diverticular bleeding given reported h/o
   diverticulosis, other possible sources of bleeding include AVM vs
   polyp/tumor.  Upper GI bleed is also possible although very unlikely
   given hemodynamic stability.  All of prior care has been at [**Hospital1 49**] so
   limited records at this time.  She has received a total of 5 units PRBC
   since admission.  Patient had a medium-sized melanic stool late morning
   of [**11-1**] be residual blood from her prior bleed.  Being
   transfused with 1 additional unit currently.  Discussed with GI, they
   do not feel that she is actively bleeding.  Plan for IR intervention if
   repeated BRBPR (no need to repeat tagged RBC scan).  If hct slowly
   trends downward, will prep and scope patient.
   -continue with tranfusion, goal HCT >28
   -serial HCT's Q8
   -2 large bore IV's for access
   -has one crossmatched unit available currently
   -NG lavage if any concern for UGIB
   -f/u GI recs,
   -f/u colorectal surgery recs
   .
   # Urinary Tract Infection: Urine grossly opaque and UA indicative of
   UTI.  Now growing E. coli.  Treating with ceftriaxone pending
   sensitivities.
   .
   #Dementia/Delirium - According to her HCP, she has h/o of increased
   agitation while hospitalized.  UTI and acute blood loss may also be
   contributing.  Delerium seems improved today
   -continue to transfuse
   -treat UTI as above
   -monitor mental status
   .
   #Periorbital Edema - appearance c/w histamine reaction, concerning for
   tranfusions reaction although would be strange for reaction to be so
   localized as she had no other signs of systemic transfusion reaction.
   Other possiblity could be localized reaction [**1-9**] chemical irritation.
   Much improved after one dose of benadryl.
   -benadryl 12.5 prn
   -monitor s/s
   .
   #? Arrhythmia - unclear history but is on amiodarone and metoprolol at
   baseline, HR currently well controlled
   -hold metoprolol give acute bleeding
   -continue amiodarone given unknown arrhythmia
   .
   # HTN - holding antihypertensives given acute GI bleeding
   -hold metoprolol, lisinopril
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   .
   #CHF
 according to her niece she has a history of heart failure with
   IVF/resuscitation during prior hospitalizations.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.  Scattered crackles on exam today, but no elevated JVP.
   Will monitor and avoid large fluid boluses.
   -transfuse prn
   -monitor volume status
   .
   #FEN - continue w/IVF/PRBC as needed, replete lytes prn, Clear liquids
   .
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # Dispo: ICU; If hct remains stable, may consider call out to floor
   tomorrow.

","The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She experienced an episode of melena yesterday and received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which appropriately increased her hematocrit (Hct) level. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). She has no known drug allergies.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 114/66 mmHg to 153/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a diminished right radial pulse and absent left radial pulse. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for well-nourished general appearance, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and absent peripheral pulses bilaterally. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 12.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 131 K/uL, sodium (Na+) level of 137 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 4.1 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented to the ICU. She has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving treatment for E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished on the right side but present on the left side. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitor, calcium carbonate, levothyroxine, and amiodarone. The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 500 mL over the past 24 hours. Her blood work indicates anemia with a low Hct level but no significant abnormalities in other lab parameters. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding appears to be under control, with no active bleeding observed. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient's bleeding seems to be under control, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or development of complications such as peptic ulcers or gastritis due to stress ulcer proph"
