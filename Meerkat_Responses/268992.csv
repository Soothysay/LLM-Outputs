   84 yo male with met adenocarcinoma of unclear primary, recent DVT on
   lovenox s/p IVC filter, admitted with retroperitoneal hematoma/acute
   blood loss anemia/shock in the context of fall/mechanical trauma and
   systemic anticoagulation
   1. Hypotension in the context of hypovolemia/acute blood loss anemia:
   Currently normotensive following blood transfusion/ffp.
   Given active bleeding with dropping hct this morning, will transfuse an
   additional 2 units blood
   Serial hct's q4h and serial abdominal exams
   Has 2 peripheral IV's
   Will touch base with pt's hematologist re: protamine reversal, if
   needed
   2. Lactic acidosis: resolved on repeat check
   3. Leukocytosis: likely secondary to acute bleed. Blood cultures
   pending. Most recent U/A drawn in the context of indwelling Foley- will
   obtain repeat sample after foley changed
   4. Hyperkalemia: pt received kayexelate
   5. ARF: most likely pre-renal given blood loss and high specific
   gravity on U/A. Will transfuse blood and continue to monitor urine

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unclear primary, recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. He was admitted with a retroperitoneal hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and shock following a fall with mechanical trauma and systemic anticoagulation.
- The patient received blood transfusion and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to hypotension in the context of hypovolemia/acute blood loss anemia.
- Active bleeding was observed with a dropping hematocrit (Hct) this morning, so an additional 2 units of blood will be transfused.
- Serial Hct's every 4 hours and serial abdominal exams are planned.
- The patient has two peripheral IV lines.
- Protamine reversal, if needed, will be discussed with the patient's hematologist.
- Lactic acidosis has resolved on repeat check.
- Leukocytosis is likely secondary to acute bleed. Blood cultures are pending.
- A repeat urinary analysis (U/A) will be obtained after the Foley catheter change.
- Hyperkalemia has been treated with kayexelate.
- Acute renal failure (ARF) is most likely pre-renal due to blood loss and high specific gravity on U/A. Blood transfusion will continue to monitor urine output.
- Other issues will be managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of central nervous system adenocarcinoma of unclear primary, recent deep vein thrombosis on lovenox with inferior vena cava filter placement, myelodysplastic syndrome, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%, tachy-brady syndrome with pacemaker placement, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and prostate cancer treated with radiation. The patient was admitted with retroperitoneal hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and shock following a fall and mechanical trauma, along with systemic anticoagulation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension in the context of hypovolemia/acute blood loss anemia: The patient is currently normotensive following blood transfusion and fresh frozen plasma. An additional 2 units of blood will be transfused, and serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will be checked every 4 hours along with serial abdominal exams.

2. Lactic acidosis: This has resolved on repeat check.

3. Leukocytosis: This is likely secondary to acute bleed. Blood cultures are pending. A repeat urine analysis will be obtained after the Foley catheter is changed.

4. Hyperkalemia: Close monitoring will be required, as the patient may require frequent transfusions"

   prostate ca, MDS with recent dx adenoca of unknown primary and recent
   DVT who presents with hypotension and RP bleed.
   .
   RP bleed.  Patient was initially hypotensive, but now normotensive for
   24 hours.  S/p 6 units of PRBCs and Hct from  19.7
 27.3.  Also, s/p 1
   unit FFP.  No lovenox for 48 hours, so likely no longer
   anticoagulated.  Hct seems to have stabilized, so will hold of on
   interventional procedeure.  Patient has MDS so baseline Hct is 30.
   --transfuse for HCT >30
   -2 PIVs
   -hold diuretics and other cardiac meds for now
   -QID Hcts
   - Type and Cross 4 units
   - consider IR for embolization if unable to stabilize the bleed
   - oxycodone for back pain

   Leukocytosis.  Etiologies include infection, vs, stress response, vs
   malignancy.   Also on dexamethasone.  Leukocytosis has been present for
   11 days without clear source of infection or fever.  UA positive, so
   currently on day 2 of levaquin.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue levaquin
   - trend fever curve and WBC count

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, prostate cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, and adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. He presents with hypotension and retroperitoneal bleed. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and his hemoglobin level has stabilized. The patient's leukocytosis is being evaluated for potential causes such as infection, stress response, or malignancy. The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on hold for lovenox due to the bleed. The patient has adenocarcinoma of unknown primary and is undergoing further hematologic/oncologic workup. He has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40-45% and is on an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with outpatient medication. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Bleeding: The patient's current retroperitoneal bleed needs close monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis should be evaluated for possible infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be"

   DVT who presents with hypotension and RP bleed.
   .
   RP bleed.  Patient was initially hypotensive, but now normotensive for
   24 hours.  S/p 6 units of PRBCs and Hct from  19.7
 27.3.  Also, s/p 1
   unit FFP.  No lovenox for 48 hours, so likely no longer
   anticoagulated.  Hct seems to have stabilized, so will hold of on
   interventional procedeure.  Patient has MDS so baseline Hct is 30.
   --transfuse for HCT >30
   -2 PIVs
   -hold diuretics and other cardiac meds for now
   -QID Hcts
   - Type and Cross 4 units
   - consider IR for embolization if unable to stabilize the bleed
   - oxycodone for back pain
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Etiologies include infection, vs, stress response, vs
   malignancy.   Also on dexamethasone.  Leukocytosis has been present for
   11 days without clear source of infection or fever.  UA positive, so
   currently on day 2 of levaquin.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue levaquin
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   ..
   ARF.  Likely secondary to pre-renal in setting of hypovolemia.
   Baseline ~1.  Continue IVFs and PRBCs.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   H/o DVT.  Patient is s/p IVC filter.  Lovenox is being held for > 48
   hours due to bleed.
   -hold lovenox in setting of bleed
   .
   Adeno CA of unknown primary.   Pt undergoing heme/onc w/u. Unknown
   primary but with adenoca with metastases to the brain. Pt undergoing
   cyber knife eval.
   .
   CHF.  Patient has a history of CHF with EF of  40-45% in [**2108**].  Patient
   is s/p AICD.
   -tele
   -transfuse for goal >30
   - monitor for signs of pulmonary edema/chf in setting of fluid
   resuscitation for bleeding
   - hold aspirin, BB,  but continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and prostate cancer, among other conditions. He presents with hypotension and right-sided pleural bleeding. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. His hematocrit level has stabilized, so further intervention has been postponed. The patient's leukocytosis is being evaluated for possible causes such as infection, stress response, or malignancy. He is also on dexamethasone. The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to pre-renal causes due to hypovolemia. He is receiving intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells. His creatinine level is being monitored, and medications are being adjusted for renal function. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is undergoing hematology/oncology workup for adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. He is scheduled for cyberknife evaluation. The patient's heart failure is being managed with cardiac diet and repletion of electrolytes as needed. He is also being monitored for signs of pulmonary edema. The patient has hypothyroidism and is on outpatient regimen. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and deep vein thrombosis prevention. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and his disposition is pending hemodynamic and hematocrit stability."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of met CNS adenocarcinoma, craniectomy, recent DVT, MDS, MGUS, CHF, tachy-brady syndrome, CAD, and prostate CA. He was admitted on 08/25 with retroperitoneal hematoma, acute blood loss anemia, and shock due to a fall, mechanical trauma, and systemic anticoagulation. The patient has been transfused with 4u prbc and 1u FFP. He is currently normotensive and has resolved lactic acidosis. However, he is still leukocytotic, hyperkalemic, and has acute renal failure. The plan is to continue monitoring his condition, transfuse blood to goal hct 30, and perform serial hct's and abdominal exams. Cyberknife treatment for adenoca in the brain is planned for tomorrow. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension in the context of hypovolemia/acute blood loss anemia: The patient may experience recurrent hypotension if he loses more blood or if the transfused blood products do not adequately increase his blood volume.
2. Lactic acidosis: While the patient's lactic acidosis has resolved, there is a risk of it recurring if the patient's tissue perfusion decreases again.
3. Infection: The patient's urine analysis suggests possible infection, and he is currently on empiric lev"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and prostate cancer. He presented with hypotension and a rapid decline in hemoglobin levels due to a presumed bleeding event. The cause of the bleeding is still unclear, but it may be related to an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter that was placed two weeks earlier. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hemoglobin levels have stabilized. He also received one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's blood product requirements are decreasing, and his baseline hemoglobin level is 30.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's initial presentation was a rapid decline in hemoglobin levels due to a presumed bleeding event. This indicates a potential ongoing risk of bleeding, which needs to be closely monitored.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. He has received 9 units of PRBCs, which may contribute to fluid overload and exacerbate heart failure symptoms. Signs of pulmonary edema or worsening CHF should be monitored.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient experienced pre-renal acute renal failure, likely due to hypovolemia secondary to bleeding. This has since resolved with blood product transfusion and his creatinine level has returned to baseline. Ren"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, s/p CABG, prostate cancer, MDS, and recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, along with a recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with hypotension and rectal bleeding (RP bleed), which has now stabilized. The cause of the RP bleed remains unclear, possibly related to an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed two weeks earlier. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved from 19.7% to 28.7%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Rectal Bleeding (RP bleed): The patient initially presented with hypotension and RP bleed, which has now stabilized. The cause of the RP bleed is unclear, but may be related to the IVC filter. The patient received multiple units of PRBCs and FFP to stabilize his condition.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a high white blood cell (WBC) count, likely due to stress response or malignancy. This is further supported by the use of dexamethasone, which can contribute to leukocytosis. There is no evidence of infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The"

   Patient reports stable abdominal and side pain.  He reports no
   difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hct 28 --> 27.5 --> 1 unit PRBC --> 27.9 --> 1 unit PRBC --> 30.2
   -->  28.7 --> 1 unit PRBCs.  In total, he has received 3 units of PRBCs
   over 24 hours, and 9 units of PRBCs total.
   - PICC line placed; CXR to confirm placement showed mild CHF.
   - outpatient radiation oncologist will proceed with cyberknife tomorrow
   if he is hemodynamically stable
   - Urology consult called because foley had been placed at time of brain
   surgery and remained in placed due to patient comfort (had episodes of
   urinary frequency and nocturia).  For a long term plan, patient will
   likely keep foley in place as it is keeping him comfortable.
   Ultimately, he will follow up with his outpatient urologist.
   - Wound care consult called regarding skin breakdown.
   - PCP visited the patient.  She thinks he would benefit from rehab stay
   after discharge.
   - Blood pressuring trending upward during the day
   - Creatinine is back at his baseline --> 1.0
   - levoquin stopped b/c UCx showed yeast

   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 1136**] this am, and I discussed the plan with
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5142**] and agree with her note and plan as above. I note that pt
   received 3u prbcs over the last 24 hrs for likely continued slow
   bleeding. Clinically, pt feels well- he continues to note R-sided
   superficial abd and flank pain. He denies LH, dizziness, cp or sob. On
   exam I note bibasilar crackles on lung exam, and abd w/ ecchymoses over
   RLQ and R flank with tenderness to palpation over the RLQ that is
   superficial. On labs I note that  most recent Hct is 28.7, INR is 1.1
   and plts 117. I agree with the plan to transfer Mr. [**Known lastname 1136**] to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] today for cyber knife procedure. He continues to have a
   transfusion requirement likely related to ongoing slow bleed, but his
   hemodynamic stability since admission indicate stability for transfer
   out of the ICU to gen medicine/ Onc floor. Given his large transfusion
   requirement over the course of his hospital stay, he should have both
   his coags and his fibrinogen monitored for possible dilutional
   coagulopathy. Pt also has an ischemic cardiomyopathy w/ depressed EF
   and fluid status will need to be monitored in the setting of volume
   resuscitation.

   been made aware of the plan as above.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and prostate cancer, among other conditions. He presents with hypotension and right-sided pelvic bleed, now stabilizing. He has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to ongoing bleeding. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have improved from 19.7 to 28.7, but he still requires transfusion. The cause of the pelvic bleed remains unclear, possibly related to an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed two weeks earlier. 

Medical Complications:
1. Right pelvic bleed: The patient's initial hypotension has stabilized, but the cause of the right-sided pelvic bleed is still unclear. It may be related to the IVC filter that was placed two weeks ago. He has received multiple units of PRBCs and FFP to manage the bleeding. His Hct levels have improved, but he continues to require transfusion. Further intervention may be necessary if the rate of bleeding increases.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to stress response or malignancy. This could be exacerbated by dexamethasone, which contributes to leukocytosis. The leukocytosis has been present for 12 days without clear signs of infection or fever. The trend in fever curve and W"

   Patient reports stable abdominal and side pain.  He reports no
   difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Hct 28 --> 27.5 --> 1 unit PRBC --> 27.9 --> 1 unit PRBC --> 30.2
   -->  28.7 --> 1 unit PRBCs.  In total, he has received 3 units of PRBCs
   over 24 hours, and 9 units of PRBCs total.
   - PICC line placed; CXR to confirm placement showed mild CHF.
   - outpatient radiation oncologist will proceed with cyberknife tomorrow
   if he is hemodynamically stable
   - Urology consult called because foley had been placed at time of brain
   surgery and remained in placed due to patient comfort (had episodes of
   urinary frequency and nocturia).  For a long term plan, patient will
   likely keep foley in place as it is keeping him comfortable.
   Ultimately, he will follow up with his outpatient urologist.
   - Wound care consult called regarding skin breakdown.
   - PCP visited the patient.  She thinks he would benefit from rehab stay
   after discharge.
   - Blood pressuring trending upward during the day
   - Creatinine is back at his baseline --> 1.0
   - levoquin stopped b/c UCx showed yeast

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of RP bleed. He reports stable abdominal and side pain, with no difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) over 24 hours due to ongoing blood loss. A PICC line was placed, and a chest X-ray confirmed mild congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient will proceed with cyberknife treatment tomorrow if hemodynamically stable. A urology consult was called due to episodes of urinary frequency and nocturia, and a Foley catheter was placed. Wound care consult was also called regarding skin breakdown. The patient's blood pressure is trending upward during the day, and his creatinine level is back at baseline at 1.0. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Constipation: The patient is at risk of constipation due to Miralax use and immobility.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a large right lower and suprapubic hematoma, which increases the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
3. Chronic pain: The patient reports stable abdominal and side pain, indicating ongoing pain management needs.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has an elevated potassium level of 5.9 mEq/L, indicating potential hyperkalemia.
