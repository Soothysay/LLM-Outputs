","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms, and a recent hospital admission for Fournier's gangrene requiring debridement and suprapubic catheter placement. He presented with hematemesis and was found to have two duodenal ulcers with visible vessels and overlying clot, which were injected with epinephrine and clipped. The patient received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with a final hematocrit of 29.8%. No further hematemesis was noted, and the patient's blood pressure remained stable. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. His physical examination revealed a crescendo decrescendo murmur loudest at the right upper sternal border, clear breath sounds, and warm extremities without edema. Neurological examination showed the patient to be alert and oriented to time, place, and person. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 9.2 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms. He has undergone right hypogastric coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**] and was recently hospitalized for Fournier's gangrene from [**2196-2-5**]. The patient presented with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and two duodenal ulcers with visible vessels were cauterized during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing pantoprazole infusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of upper GI bleed and duodenal ulcers, which increases the risk of rebleeding.
2. Infection: Given the patient's recent hospitalization for Fournier's gangrene, there is a potential risk of infection in the ICU.
3. Cardiac Events: The patient has a history of CAD, which puts him at an increased risk for cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's current creatinine level is elevated at 1.3 mg/dL, indicating a potential risk of renal dysfunction.
5. Thromboembolic"

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms, and a previous right hypogastric coiled embolization. He also has a recent hospital admission and discharge for Fournier's gangrene requiring debridement and suprapubic catheter placement. The patient presented with hematemesis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s. In the emergency department, he experienced chest pain and an electrocardiogram (EKG) showing anterolateral ST depressions, which both resolved with blood transfusions. An abdominal CT with intravenous contrast was performed, revealing no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the operating room while intubated. Notably, there were two duodenal ulcers with visible vessels and overlying clots, which were injected with epinephrine and clipped. His hematocrit (Hct) level improved from 22% to 27% with five units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), then to 25.9% with one more unit of PRBC, and finally reached 29.8%"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and bilateral large common iliac aneurysms. He underwent right hypogastric coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**]. The patient presented with hematemesis and was admitted to the MICU for further management.

The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which is likely upper GIB but also includes brisk lower bleed. The differential diagnosis includes ulcerative disease, gastritis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), Dieulafoy lesion, and bowel carcinoma. There is no evidence of aortoenteric fistula on abdominal CT.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the emergency department and had chest pain/T wave changes on EKG consistent with ischemia. Additional transfusion of 2 units of PRBC was given upon arrival to the floor. Platelets were also transfused due to the patient's history of aspirin use. Three peripheral intravenous lines are in place.

FFP transfusion has been temporarily held pending recheck of coagulation parameters. A gastrointestinal plan to scope tonight has been made. Pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion is continued, and the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) will be checked every 4 hours. A consultation with a general surgeon and interventional radiologist is planned.

The patient's cardiac status includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It is likely that demand ischemia in the setting of anemia has occurred, but chest pain is now resolved. The management plan for GIB remains the same as mentioned earlier. Metoprolol will be restarted when the patient is stable, and statin therapy will be continued. Aspirin use will be held.

Regarding the patient's infrarenal AAA with bilateral common iliac aneurysms, there is no evidence of aortoenteric fistula. The patient underwent right hypogastric coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**]. Vascular recommendations are pending.

The patient also has a history of Fournier's Gangrene, which involved periurethral abscesses requiring operative debridement and suprapubic urinary catheter placement on [**2197-1-10**]. A 10-day course of levofloxacin has been prescribed. Urology has been notified of the patient's admission.

The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM). Metoprolol will be restarted when the patient is stable.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be managed, and glycemic control will be maintained. The patient currently has three lines: an 18-gauge line placed on ["

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms. He underwent right hypogastric coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**]. The patient also had a recent hospital admission and discharge on [**2196-2-5**] for Fournier's gangrene requiring debridement and suprapubic catheter placement. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed and spinal cord pressure in the 80s. In the emergency department, he experienced chest pain and an electrocardiogram (EKG) showing anterolateral ST depressions, both of which resolved with blood transfusions. An abdominal CT with intravenous contrast was performed, showing no evidence of aorto-enteric fistula.

The patient's arterial line was started on [**2197-2-9**] at 08:02 AM. He has no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was levofloxacin on [**2197-2-10**] at 12:17 AM. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) since [**2197-2-9**] at 08:00 PM. He is also on other ICU medications.

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, hematocrit remained stable and no signs of bleeding.  Has
   some mild hypoxia
   Vitals as above
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: Soft NT ND
   Ext: no edema
   Scrotum: well-healing wound
   Labs as above
   CXR: mild pulmonary congestion
   Assessment:
   1)       Anemia (GI bleed)
   2)       Hypoxia: likely secondary pulmonary congestion from
   resuscitation in combination with AS
   Plan:
   1)       Continue serial hematocrits
   2)       Allow auto-diuresis at this time as oxygenation improving and
   good urine output
   Addendum: Patient just had melenonic stool -> will hold in ICU and make
   GI and surgery aware.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms. He also has a history of right hypogastric coiled embolization, recent hospital admission and discharge for Fournier's gangrene requiring debridement and suprapubic catheter placement. The patient was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypotension, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed duodenal ulcers.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 79 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 93/63 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and normal extremities without edema.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) at 10.4 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 7.1 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) at 123 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.3 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.03 ng/mL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of upper GI bleeding due to duodenal ulcers, hypertension, and a history of Fournier's gangrene. The patient is on pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and will be advanced to a clear liquid diet. The arterial line will be removed today. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding from the duodenal ulcers.
2. Development of kidney injury or worsening renal function.
3. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia due to aspiration or pulmonary edema.
4. Cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
5. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization.
6. Infection at the site of previous surgery or catheter insertion sites.
7. Further deterioration in the patient's general condition, leading to multi-organ failure.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and it is important to consider other factors and perform further evaluations to determine the exact medical complications that can arise in this patient's case."

The patient has a complex medical history including a previous right hypogastric coiled embolization, coronary artery disease with a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and recent Fournier's gangrene requiring operative debridement and suprapubic urinary catheter placement.

On admission, the patient was found to have gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely due to upper GIB but also considering brisk lower bleed. Differential diagnosis includes ulcerative disease, gastritis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), Dieulafoy lesion, and bowel carcinoma. There is no evidence of aortoenteric fistula on abdominal CT.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the emergency department and experienced chest pain and T-wave changes on EKG consistent with ischemia. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been monitored and stabilized, and platelets were transfused due to the patient's history of aspirin use.

The patient's current medications include proton pump inhibitor (PPI), metoprolol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8807**] is a 67 year-old man with a history of a large infrarenal
   AAA with bilateral large common iliac aneurysms, s/p right hypogastric
   coiled embolization on [**2197-1-17**], who presents with hematemesis and is
   admitted to the MICU for further management.
   # GIB: Likely upper GIB but would also consider brisk lower bleed.
   Differential diagnosis includes ulcerative disease, gastritis, AVM,
   Dieulafoy lesion, and bowel carcinoma.  No evidence of aortoenteric
   fistula on abd CT.  Received 2u PRBC and 2u FFP in ED and had chest
   pain/T wave changes on EKG consistent with ischemia.
   - tranfuse additional 2 units on arrival to floor
   - Hct goal of 30, transfused platelets given ASA history
   - 3 PIVs in place
   - hold on FFP transfusion pending coags recheck
   - GI plans to scope tonight
   - continue PPI gtt
   - check hct q4h
   - gen [**Doctor First Name 91**] and IR c/s
   - trend ionized calcium
   - f/u final abd CT read
   - vascular reccs
   # CAD s/p PCI:  Likely demand ischemia in setting of anemia, CP now
   resolved.
   - GIB mgmnt as above
   - cycle CEs
   - restart metoprolol when stable
   - cont statin
   - hold aspirin
   # Infrarenal AAA with b/l common iliac aneurysms: No evidence of
   aorto-enteric fistula. R hypogastric (internal iliac artery) coiled
   embolization on [**2197-1-17**]
   - vascular reccs
   - restart metoprolol when stable
   # Fournier's Gangrene: Had periurethral abscesses requiring operative
   debridment and suprapubic urinary catheter placement [**2197-1-10**].
   - cont levoflox for 10 day course ([**Date range (1) 11092**])
   - notify urology of admission
   # Hypertension:
   - restart metoprolol when stable
