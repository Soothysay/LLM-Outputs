   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 3255**] is a 71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD,
   admitted with b/l PE in setting of  having bowel resection and vaginal
   hysterectomy one month ago.
   1.       PE.  Patient has large bilateral central PEs.  Currently has
   weaned down from 6LNC to 2L NC and satting well.  She is persistently
   hypotensive requiring 0.15 levophed to maintain her pressure and BPs
   improved this am.  Evidence of RV strain on EKG with elevated BNP,
   troponins, and noted to have dilated RV on CTA of the chest with RV to
   LVrationm approximately 2.  Given recent surgery and age, femoral line,
   and high risk  of bleeding, will defer thrombolytics for now since
   pressor and O2 requirements improved this am. If unstable, pressor
   requirement increased or hypoxia worsens will readdress need for
   thrombolytics but would like to avoid if possible. Gyn and [**Doctor First Name 91**] okay
   with lytics if necessary.  LENIs negative for DVT.  Per patient, up to
   date on colonoscopy and mammogram and there is no personal or family
   history of malignancy. PE most likely secondary to post-op setting and
   decreased ambulation, immobility. Elevated Lfts troponin, BNP
   concerning.
   -          Heparin drip with goal of 60-90
   -          Tylenol for chest pain
   -          wean O2 if able
   -          continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   -          close monitoring with consideration of thrombolytics if
   decompensates
   -          No filter since no LE DVT seen
   -          Echo to eval for RV thrombus since would be indicator for
   thrombolytics
   -
   2.       Hypotension.  Patient on numerous antihypertensive at home,
   but hypotensive here and requiring levophed.  Hypotension likely
   secondary to large PE, Rv strain. Also appears dry on exam, c/o thirst.
   Need to be careful with fluids to not overload RV but does need preload
   as well. Hypotension improved this am, so will attempt to wean
   pressors, give fluids.
   - NS bolus 1L
   -          levophed to maintain MAPs>60
   -          monitor BP
   -          hold antihypertensives
   -          consider thrombolysis if unstable, increased pressor
   requirement
          3 .   Elevated LFTs: Transaminitis likely secondary to shock
   liver from hypotension and pressor requirement. Unclear if hypotensive
   prior to arrival as well since had chest pain overnight prior to
   admission and presentation.
                - Follow. Maintain perfusion pressure
   4.       DM.  On metformin at home.
   -          ISS
   -          Follow fingersticks
   5.       GERD.
   -          IV PPI
   6.       CRI.  Likely secondary to longstanding hypertension requiring
   5 home antihypertensives.  Cr at baseline.
   -          renally dose all meds
   -
   PPx: therapeutic heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in the setting of recent bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy one month ago. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is hypotensive, requiring levophed to maintain blood pressure. EKG shows evidence of right ventricular strain, and cardiac troponins and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest revealed a dilated right ventricle. Given the recent surgery and age, thrombolytic therapy was avoided initially but may be considered if the patient fails to improve with current management. Lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is up-to-date with colonoscopy and mammogram, and there is no personal or family history of malignancy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has experienced several significant events. 

1. The patient had an EKG done at 01:39 PM, which was followed by an increase in potassium levels to K+ 5.6. Subsequently, the patient required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

2. At 4:30 PM, the patient appeared tachypnic with increased work-of breathing, leading to a chest X-ray and blood gas analysis. The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection and experienced bradycardia and hypotension. A code blue was called, and the patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA). After administering bicarb and performing chest compressions, the patient regained a pulse.

3. The patient was treated for hyperkalemia and severe acidosis. Cardiology was paged, and an echocardiogram was performed while awaiting tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). The preliminary findings showed right ventricular strain and septal impact on the left ventricle. TPA was administered over two hours, and the patient was placed back on heparin.

4. The patient required two pressor agents and was started on a dextrose drip for hyperglycemia. 

5. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate ranging from 72-157 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/29-168/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 32, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O.

6. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), troponin T, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The patient also has a low platelet count (Plt) and decreased hemoglobin (Hct).

7. The patient's assessment and plan include acute metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), cardiac arrest, and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or further pulmonary embolisms due to immobilization and hypercoagulable state.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
5. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to corticosteroid use and ICU stay.
6. Arrhythmias or cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial injury from the PE and subsequent cardiac arrest.
7. Renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
8. Wound infections or pressure ulcers due to immobility and prolonged ICU stay.

These are potential complications based on the provided information, and the actual complications faced by the patient may vary."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to intubation and invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and required resuscitation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate (HR) of 105 bpm with a range of 72-157 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/29 mmHg to 168/92 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 32 breaths per minute with a range of 20-43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 22 mmHg, HCO3 of 15 mEq/L, base excess of -4 mEq/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 340, and ventilation (Ve) of 15.6 L/min. These values indicate respiratory alkalosis with compensatory metabolic acidosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), troponin T, creatinine (Cr), lactate, and liver enzymes such as ALT"

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # Hemodyanamics 1 Day s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely
   secondary to PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to both lactic acidosis, less
   likely ketoacidosis (although BG in 300
s) and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolearated with goal SBP
   90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate is decreasing.
   -          Formal TTE today to assess RV function. Also in setting of
   troponin bump will assess LVEF
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis. Pt
s PTT remains > 60.
   -          Will restart Heparin gtt once PTT < 60
   -          TTE today to assess RV
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Transition from AC to PS this AM as tolerated and re-assess
   this PM
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion. GFR essentially zero
   given increase in Cr over past day and now no urine output. Pt now up
   13L since admission.
   -          No current indications for dialsysi given Acid-Base Status
   has corrected, K normal, Not yet fluid overloaded, No signs of uremia
   -          Will consider renal consult later today if pts BP still
   requiring pressers, and pt not urinating, for potential CVVH
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   -          TTE Today
   -          Pt
s PTT remains >60

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely secondary to the PE. The patient underwent thrombolysis and is now being weaned off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had increased work of breathing due to a gap metabolic acidosis and was unable to compensate. However, her acid-base status has improved following presumed lysis of the clot and decrease in dead-space.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's GFR is essentially zero given the increase in creatinine over the past day and no urine output. This may be due to hypoperfusion, resulting in ATN (acute tubular necrosis).

3. Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: The patient now has saddle PEs, which have been lysed. Her PTT remains elevated, and she will restart heparin gtt once PTT < 60.

4. Shock Liver: The patient likely has shock liver secondary to hypoperfusion. No interventions are indicated at this time.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR continues to rise, likely due to shock liver. No current indications for vitamin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of cardiac arrest, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), pulmonary embolism, chest pain, and acidosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 148/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The FiO2 is set at 50% and PEEP is at 5 cmH2O. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, should be conducted.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and immobilization, there is an increased risk of developing DVT and PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be implemented.

3. Stress ulcers:"

   1.       Shock: in setting of massive PE s/p lysis
   At present, her hemodynamics are stable allowing us to wean her

 suggesting that she has improved RV outflow. We will try to
   get Neosynephrine off, repeat Echo to eval extent of RV overload bowing

   volume overloaded and no longer urinating which will make possibility

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient experienced a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient received lytics for the PE and showed improved hemodynamics.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Shock: The patient was in shock due to the massive PE but has now stabilized, allowing for weaning off pressors. However, there is still concern about right ventricular (RV) overload, which may be causing hemodynamic compromise. An echocardiogram will be repeated to evaluate this further.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient underwent lytic therapy for the PE and will need to restart a heparin drip. A follow-up echocardiogram will also be conducted.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for profound shock and acidosis. Currently, there is significant improvement in dead space following the lytics.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has dense ARF in the setting of severe hypoperfusion.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis in the setting of profound hypoperfusion.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluct"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was intubated for profound shock and acidosis and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient received lytics for the massive PE and showed improvement in hemodynamics, but remains hemodynamically unstable.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Shock: The patient experienced shock in the setting of massive PE after lytics administration. Although the patient's hemodynamics are currently stable, allowing for weaning of pressors, there is still a possibility of recurrent hemodynamic compromise due to right ventricular (RV) overload.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient had an acute PE that responded to lytics. However, the patient remains at risk for further complications related to PE, such as recurrent embolism or pulmonary hypertension.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for profound shock and acidosis. Although the patient's respiratory status has improved significantly post-lytics, there is still a need for ongoing respiratory support.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has dense ARF in the setting of severe hypoperfusion. This can be attributed to decreased renal perfusion caused by the massive PE and subsequent shock.

5. Transaminitis: The patient also exhibits signs of transaminitis, likely due to profound hypoperfusion. This is supported by"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary to bilateral
   PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap metabolic acidosis
   likely secondary to both lactic acidosis and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo and levophed.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolerated with goal SBP 90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs decreasing.
   -          Will likely need CVVH
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on restarted heparin gtt. Pt
   PTT remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Continue PS as tolerated
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion and decreased forward
   flow. GFR essentially zero given increase in Cr over past day and now
   no urine output. Pt now up 13L since admission. Pt anuric with volume
   overload needs improved volume status for hemodynamics.
   -          Renal consult for CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3630**] [**Male First Name (un) **] insulin gtt thwen
   with hypoglycemia likely from liver disease so changed to sliding
   scale.
   -          Insulin sliding scale.
   # Low grade fever: Pt with low grade fevers. Possible sources include
   line (fem line), urine (has foley), superimposed PNA, possible

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) following bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely secondary to the bilateral PE and worsening metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis and/or uremia.

The patient underwent thrombolysis and was able to be weaned from three pressors down to norepinephrine and levophed. The current plan includes continuing to wean the pressors as tolerated, aiming for a systolic blood pressure of 90-150s. Trends in lactate, creatinine, liver function tests (LFTs), and urine output will be monitored to assess end-organ perfusion.

The patient has been restarted on heparin gtt for saddle pulmonary embolism, with a goal PTT of 60-80. The arterial blood gas (ABG) status has improved following presumed lysis of the clot and decrease in dead-space. The patient's acute respiratory failure was secondary to increased work of breathing in the setting of metabolic acidosis and inability to compensate.

The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypoperfusion and decreased forward flow. The glomerular filtration rate ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an initial complaint of chest pain. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was intubated. The patient remains anuric, indicating a lack of urine output. The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable, with readings ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 135/76 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is elevated, ranging from 99-115 bpm. The patient's temperature has fluctuated, with a maximum of 38.2 C and a current temperature of 37.7 C. The patient's respiratory rate is set at 25 breaths per minute, but spontaneous rate is 22 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, PaO2 of 104 mmHg, and HCO3- of 17 mEq/L. The patient's arterial blood gases (ABG) indicate respiratory failure and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's low respiratory rate and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate acute respiratory failure. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which is a life"

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # Hemodyanamics 1 Day s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely
   secondary to PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to both lactic acidosis, less
   likely ketoacidosis (although BG in 300
s) and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolearated with goal SBP
   90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate is decreasing.
   -          Formal TTE today to assess RV function. Also in setting of
   troponin bump will assess LVEF
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis. Pt
s PTT remains > 60.
   -          Will restart Heparin gtt once PTT < 60
   -          TTE today to assess RV
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Transition from AC to PS this AM as tolerated and re-assess
   this PM
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion. GFR essentially zero
   given increase in Cr over past day and now no urine output. Pt now up
   13L since admission.
   -          No current indications for dialsysi given Acid-Base Status
   has corrected, K normal, Not yet fluid overloaded, No signs of uremia
   -          Will consider renal consult later today if pts BP still
   requiring pressers, and pt not urinating, for potential CVVH
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   -          TTE Today
   -          Pt
s PTT remains >60
   # Hyperglycemia: FS 300-400
s overnight. Now on D10 drip at 50.
   -          Will decrease both dose and rate for better FS control.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for bilateral pulmonary embolism during a bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest likely secondary to the pulmonary embolism and required thrombolysis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute on mechanical ventilation, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. The troponin-T level is slightly elevated, and there are abnormal liver function test results. The blood cultures are negative for growth. The imaging shows an endotracheal tube positioned 3 cm above the carina.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemodynamics: The patient is currently on multiple pressors due to a previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The goal is to wean the patient off the pressors, maintaining a systolic blood pressure between 90-150 mmHg.
2. Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) post lytics, along with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient's condition is critical, and they are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has experienced significant end organ injury to the liver and kidneys, leading to acute kidney injury (ARF). There are several potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions:

1. Shock: The patient is in shock due to the massive PE and significant end organ injury. This can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs, causing further damage.

2. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction: The patient has likely developed RV dysfunction as a result of the massive PE. This can cause hemodynamic instability and worsen the patient's condition.

3. Fluid overload: The patient is volume overloaded, which can contribute to respiratory distress and worsening heart function.

4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Although not specifically mentioned as ARDS in the note, the patient's respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging raise the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and require advanced respiratory support.

5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating potential hepatic dysfunction. This may be due to hypoperfusion or direct injury from the PE.

6. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing dense acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The key issues include:

1. Shock: The patient is in a state of shock, likely secondary to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred after lytic therapy. Hemodynamic stability has been achieved, allowing for weaning off pressor support. However, the patient is volume overloaded and not urinating, which may require consideration of dialysis to manage fluid status.

2. PE: The patient has experienced a PE, which was treated with lytic therapy. Heparin drip should be restarted, and an echocardiogram (Echo) will be repeated to assess the extent of right ventricular (RV) overload and potential bowing into the left ventricle as a confounder of hemodynamic compromise.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for profound shock and acidosis. There has been significant improvement in dead space following lytic therapy.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing dense ARF due to severe hypoperfusion. This condition is associated with profound hypoperfusion.

5. Transaminitis: The patient is also presenting with elevated liver enzymes (transaminitis) as a result of profound hypoperfusion.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include:

- ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and comments.
- Code status: Full code.
- Disposition: ICU.
- Total time spent: 45 minutes.
- Patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening shock leading to organ hypoperfusion and failure, persistent RV overload and cardiac dysfunction, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and further deterioration of renal function."

   1.       Shock: in setting of massive PE s/p lysis with significant end
   organ injury to liver and kidneys.
   Her hemodynamics have deteriorated in setting of progressive volume
   overload and likely RV dysfunction.
   We will try to get Neosynephrine off, use Levophed if HR tolerates.
   Repeat Echo to eval extent of RV overload bowing into LV and role of
   CVVH to unload RV. She is quite volume overloaded and no longer
   urinating and will likely need CVVH for volume management mainly today
   and eventual acidosis.
   2.       PE: s/p lytics, restart heparin drip, follow up Echo today for
   reasons above.
   3.       Resp Failure: on PSV - s/p intubation for profound shock and
   acidosis. Currently with sig improved dead space s/p lytics.
   4.       ARF: dense ARF in setting of severe hypoperfusion
   5.       Transaminitis: in setting of profound hypoperfusion

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note provides detailed information about the patient's medical history, allergies, medications, and ongoing treatments.

The patient has been undergoing various interventions and treatments in the ICU, including the placement of a left femoral double-lumen dialysis catheter, initiation and discontinuation of multi-lumen dialysis, use of vasopressors (levophed and phenylephrine), continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and changes in intravenous (IV) fluids and medications.

The patient's vital signs are closely monitored, with fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels. The patient's weight has increased from 66.5 kg at admission to 74 kg currently.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate (CRRT), heparin sodium, potassium chloride (CRRT), norepinephrine, and pantoprazole. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) within the normal range. Fluid balance and urine output are also closely monitored. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 696 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for bilateral pulmonary embolism in the setting of having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She experienced a cardiac arrest with a saddle embolus that lysed. The patient remains on levophed and is being weaned off pressors. She has ongoing acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury due to hypotensive event, shock liver, coagulopathy, and troponin bump. She is also being treated for urinary tract infection empirically. Her glycemic control is being managed with insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on PS (pressure support) and needs to be weaned as tolerated. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being continued to manage the acute kidney injury. Regular monitoring of renal function is required.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR likely due to shock liver. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
4. Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has had lysis of the saddle embolus but remains on heparin. PTT (partial thromboplastin time) needs to be monitored and maintained between 60-80 seconds.

 CARDIAC ARREST
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 CHEST PAIN
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now s/p 1 day s/p PEA arrest.
   # s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary to bilateral
   PE, however was also in the setting of worsening gap metabolic acidosis
   likely secondary to both lactic acidosis and/or uremia (given pt
   essentially had GFR of 0 given no UOP). Following thrombolysis, pt able
   to be weaned from 3 pressors down to Neo and levophed.
   -          Cont to wean pressors as BP tolerated with goal SBP 90-150s.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, UOP as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs decreasing.
   -          Will likely need CVVH
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on restarted heparin gtt. Pt
   PTT remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Was secondary to increased work of
   breathing in setting of gap metabolic acidosis and pt unable to
   compensate (pt
s HCO3  was down to 7).  Acid-Base Status now much
   improved following presumed lysis of clot and decrease in dead-space
   (given pt
s sudden pH normalization).
   -          Continue PS as tolerated
   # ARF: Likely ATN secondary to hypoperfusion and decreased forward
   flow. GFR essentially zero given increase in Cr over past day and now
   no urine output. Pt now up 13L since admission. Pt anuric with volume
   overload needs improved volume status for hemodynamics.
   -          Renal consult for CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Likely secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to rise. Likely [**3-6**] to shock liver. No
   current indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3630**] [**Male First Name (un) **] insulin gtt thwen
   with hypoglycemia likely from liver disease so changed to sliding
   scale.
   -          Insulin sliding scale.
   # Low grade fever: Pt with low grade fevers. Possible sources include
   line (fem line), urine (has foley), superimposed PNA, possible
   aspiration during arrest.
   -          check u/a and cx
   -          consider resite fem line
   -          CIS
   # FEN: Not on TFs. Will start today. Replete lytes prn and recheck in

   1.       Shock: in setting of massive PE s/p lysis with significant end
   organ injury to liver and kidneys.
   Her hemodynamics have deteriorated in setting of progressive volume
   overload and likely RV dysfunction.
   We will try to get Neosynephrine off, use Levophed if HR tolerates.
   Repeat Echo to eval extent of RV overload bowing into LV and role of
   CVVH to unload RV. She is quite volume overloaded and no longer
   urinating and will likely need CVVH for volume management mainly today
   and eventual acidosis.
   2.       PE: s/p lytics, restart heparin drip, follow up Echo today for
   reasons above.
   3.       Resp Failure: on PSV - s/p intubation for profound shock and
   acidosis. Currently with sig improved dead space s/p lytics.
   4.       ARF: dense ARF in setting of severe hypoperfusion
   5.       Transaminitis: in setting of profound hypoperfusion
 LFTS
   have peaked and are trending down.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated. 

Key events include the placement of a left femoral double lumen dialysis catheter, initiation of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), and the use of multi-lumen catheter for dialysis. The patient's allergies are noted as no known drug allergies.

The patient is receiving several medications, including fentanyl for pain management, midazolam for sedation, heparin sodium for anticoagulation, norepinephrine for blood pressure support, and potassium chloride for electrolyte management.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 111 beats per minute and hypotension with a blood pressure of 105/52 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% with the help of supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid volume. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,398 mL and an output of 1,006 mL since midnight, with positive fluid balance of 1,392 mL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure. The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission.

1. Shock: The patient had shock following the massive PE, which resulted in significant end organ injury to the liver and kidneys. Hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and the central venous pressure (CVP) is running between 14-18. Repeat echocardiogram (Echo) showed persistent right ventricular (RV) overload, bowing into the left ventricle (LV), and the role of CVVH to unload RV.

2. PE: The patient had a pulmonary embolism that was treated with lytics, and the heparin drip was restarted.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required mechanical ventilation due to profound shock and acidosis. Currently, the patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with improved dead space after lytics. The plan is to try to wean to PSV 5/5.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient developed dense ARF in the setting of severe hypoperfusion using CVVH.

5. Transaminitis: The patient had transaminitis in the setting of profound hypoperfusion, with liver function tests (LFTs) peaking"

1. The patient has a history of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure.
2. The patient was in profound shock and required intubation for acidosis. Currently, they are showing significant improvement after receiving lytic therapy.
3. The patient has acute respiratory failure and is on pressure support ventilation (PSV). Efforts will be made to wean the PSV settings.
4. The patient is experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF) due to severe hypoperfusion. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being used for renal support.
5. The patient has transaminitis, likely caused by profound hypoperfusion. Liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked and are now trending down.
6. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, chest pain, and ongoing issues noted in the housestaff notes.
7. The patient is receiving various treatments including CVVH, dialysis catheter placement, nutritional support, glycemic control, arterial line placement, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a left femoral double lumen dialysis catheter, initiation of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and insertion of a multi-lumen catheter. They are receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, analgesics, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and increased mortality if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, high C-reactive protein levels, and the presence of multi-organ dysfunction indicate the possibility of sepsis. Prompt recognition and management of infection sources are crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Cardiac Arrest: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest, there is a risk of recurrent events. Continuous monitoring and prompt resuscitation measures are necessary to manage any potential cardiac arrests.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Recurrence: Despite the placement of a inferior vena cava (IVC)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint includes respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), and chest pain. The patient has been on various medications including heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but there are fluctuations in blood pressure. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off sedation and levophed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if there are any complications with the ventilator or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure worsens.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, indicating a serious underlying cardiac condition. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac arrest if the cardiac function does not improve.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute PE, which can be life-threatening. There is a risk of further clot formation or embolization, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential hemodynamic instability.
4. Chest Pain: The patient presents with chest pain, which may indicate ongoing cardiac issues or other complications such as pleurisy or pneumonia. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and potential complications associated with the chest pain."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for bilateral pulmonary embolism during bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest and had a saddle pulmonary embolus that was lysed. She remains on heparin and continues to have an elevated PTT. She is currently intubated, sedated, and not arousable. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-96/52-76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 603 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 32. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 353, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 141 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -5, and lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. She has elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine (Cr), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T levels, along with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), and bilirubin (T Bili). Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K+) level. She is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is receiving insulin via sliding scale. The patient's medical conditions include hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, chest pain, acute kidney injury, and shock liver. The plan includes continuing to wean off pressors, monitoring lactate, creatinine, liver function tests (LFTs), and adjusting CVVH as necessary. She will also be monitored for any changes in her coagulation profile, troponin levels, and urine output. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a risk of hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and history of pulmonary embolism put her at risk for further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or worsening respiratory distress.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine"

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   # Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   -          Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   -          Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV
   dilation with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with
   a mild resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Would consider repeat echo after CVVH volume removal and return of
   hemodynamic stability.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt

   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats with reinstitution of AC ventilation as
   necessary.
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   -          Continue CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable. Likely [**3-7**] to shock liver. No current
   indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in settting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bowel resection and is at risk for developing sepsis due to potential infections.

3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a previous cardiac arrest, which could potentially recur if underlying cardiac issues are not addressed.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism, which can lead to recurrent episodes and complications such as pulmonary hypertension.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to acute kidney injury. There is a risk of worsening renal function.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a coagulation disorder. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hyperglycemia but is at risk of developing hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy.

8. Liver Dysfunction: The patient may have liver dysfunction, which can affect various metabolic processes and increase the risk of complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shock, massive pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure. The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been weaned off Levophed and is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate between 100-133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/51-105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a history of obesity and has undergone surgery. They have a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 4,524 mL and output of 4,828 mL since midnight. The patient's urine output is low at 112 mL, and there is a negative fluid balance of -304 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies are negative for drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for chest pain. The physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with decreased breath sounds at the bases, right internal jugular ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include shock, massive pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). 

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated central venous pressure (CVP). The patient is intubated and on pressure-controlled ventilation mode with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 353 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. 

The patient has received lytic therapy for the massive PE and is currently on a heparin drip. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Liver enzymes are also elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. 

The patient's glucose levels are significantly elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. The patient's electrolytes show imbalances, including low potassium (K+), low magnesium (Mg++), and low phosphate (PO4).

The patient's condition is complicated by cardiac arrest, acidosis, and acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is receiving various medications and treatments to stabilize their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not promptly treated.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The massive PE has resulted in significant end organ injury to the liver and kidneys. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation support through a tracheostomy tube. Weaning off the ventilator will be crucial to assess the progress of respiratory recovery.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has dense ARF due to severe hypoperfusion. CVVH is being used to support renal function, but close monitoring of kidney function is essential.
5. Transaminitis: Profound hypoperfusion has led to elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver injury. Monitoring of liver function and appropriate management will be necessary.
6. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is expected to improve as sedation is reduced. However, there is"

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   # Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   -          Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   -          Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV
   dilation with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with
   a mild resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt

   remains > 60.
   -          Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats with reinstitution of AC ventilation as
   necessary.
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   -          Continue CVVH
   -          f/u renal recs
   # Shock Liver: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   -          No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   # Coagulopathy: INR stable. Likely [**3-7**] to shock liver. No current
   indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for a bilateral pulmonary embolism in the setting of having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely secondary to severe acidosis in the setting of bilateral PE. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and sedated, but arousable and opens her eyes to commands. She has a murmur on cardiovascular examination.

The patient is receiving several infusions, including calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and heparin sodium. She is also on multiple medications in the ICU and other medications.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3975 mL and output of 4250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -275 mL. The patient's weight is currently 78.1 kg, with an admission weight of 66.5 kg. Her height is 62 inches.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg,"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.
   .
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so started on insulin gtt
   transitioned to insulin sliding scale.
   - ISS, monitor FSBG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple health issues. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but the 24-hour events mention that the patient's mental status has not changed overnight and they only open their eyes to commands. 

The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), and chest pain. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate between 99-131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/57 to 134/113 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 set at 40%, and other parameters indicating respiratory support. 

The physical examination findings are limited as most assessments were not done. 

Laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, creatinine, glucose levels, liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. 

The patient is receiving multiple infusions including calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and heparin sodium. They are also on several medications in the ICU. 

The patient's weight has increased from 66.5 kg at admission to 78.1 kg currently. 

The fluid balance shows a total intake of 3975 mL with 975 mL given through the total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 726 mL through tube feedings, and 2700 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 4250 mL of urine, 150 mL of nasogastric aspirate, and 700 mL of stool. 

The patient's respiratory support and ventilator settings are mentioned, indicating the need for mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's code status is full code, suggesting that they are to receive all resuscitative measures in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest. 

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications requiring intensive care management in the ICU."

   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   # Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   -          Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess
   end-organ perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   -          Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   -          Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV
   dilation with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with
   a mild resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.

   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats with reinstitution of AC ventilation as
   necessary.
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   -          Continue CVVH

   indications for Vitamin K.
   -          Continue to trend
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   -          No current interventions needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in the setting of having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely secondary to severe acidosis in the setting of bilateral PE. She underwent lysis of the saddle embolus and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated but arousable, opening her eyes to commands. She does not follow commands.

The patient has been off sedation for approximately 24 hours and is able to open her eyes to command but unable to follow other simple commands. If there is no improvement in her mental status tomorrow, a CT scan will be ordered, and her ammonia level will be checked today.

The patient remains on heparin gtt for lysis of the saddle embolus, and her PTT remains >60. She is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has been weaned off sedation. However, the patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism post lytics. 

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.
2. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 101-131 bpm, and blood pressure fluctuating between 122/58 mmHg and 134/113 mmHg.
3. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-14 mmHg and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and heparin sodium infusions.
4. The patient has altered mental status but is responsive to voice commands and answering yes/no questions in Spanish.
5. The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.7-1.8 mg/dL), liver dysfunction (AST 141 U/L, ALT 939 U/L), electrolyte imbalances (hypophosphatemia, hyperkalemia), and elevated lactate levels.
6. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.38.
7. The patient's chest X-ray shows decreased breath sounds at the bases and a right internal jugular (IJ) line.
8. The patient's recent medical history includes cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), chest pain, and previous admissions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Shock: The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the initiation of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), indicating ongoing end organ injury to the liver and kidneys.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient received lytic therapy for PE, and currently, they are on a heparin drip with good partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) after being intubated for profound shock and acidosis. There is a plan to wean to spontaneous breathing and hope for extubation this morning.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has dense ARF in the setting of severe hypoperfusion using CVVH.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) in the setting of profound hypoperfusion. LFTs have peaked and are trending down.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to consumptive coagulopathy, medication use, or less likely heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
7. Persistent hypophosphatemia: The patient has low phosphate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism in the setting of having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and had a saddle pulmonary embolus that was lysed with heparin.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications. She is intubated and sedated but is arousable and opens her eyes to command. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 142/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs with mild bibasilar crackles, distended abdomen, and peripheral edema. She has a murmur and tachycardia. Her neurological status is altered but not delirious.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, liver enzymes, and troponin-T. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has mild hyperglycemia. Imaging studies show persistent right ventricular strain with right ventricular dilation, hyperdynamic left ventricular ejection fraction,"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old female with DM2, HTN, GERD, admitted with b/l PE in setting
   of  having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy
   now 4 days s/p PEA arrest with lysed saddle embolus.
   .
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt is currently tolerated PSV.  Weaned off
   sedation, however patient continues to appear somnolent.  Will monitor
   respiratory status and o2 sats.  Currently on PSV at 5/5.
   - SBT, holding TFs
   - possible extubation if ABG is favorable
   .
    #Hemodynamics s/p PEA Arrest: Etiology of arrest was likely secondary
   to severe acidosis in setting of bilateral PE.  Currently the patient
   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.
   # Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: Now s/p lysis on heparin gtt. Pt
s PTT
   remains > 60.
   - Continue heparin gtt goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # ARF: ATN secondary to hypotensive event.  Crn much improved on CVVH,
   electrolytes within normal limits.
   - Continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
 will find out when/if renal will transition to HD
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets trending down since admission.  On
   heparin with PE and on on PPI all of which can cause thrombocytopenia
   - PM CBC
   - will add Hep dep Abs if platelets trend down further
   .
   # Shock Liver/ Coagulopathy: Secondary to hypoperfusion, improving.
   - No interventions indicated, will continue to trend
   .
   # Troponin Bump: Likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypotension, also increased RV strain. Now in the setting of ARF so
   will likely remain elevated.
   - No current interventions needed
   .
   # + UA: Pt empirically started on Cipro, however urine cultures showed
   yeast only.  Will discontinue cipro at this time.  Will restart if
   develops symptoms.  Resolved for now.
   .
   # Hypoglycvemia: Pt had hyperglycemia so started on insulin gtt
   transitioned to insulin sliding scale.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for a bilateral pulmonary embolism in the setting of having bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and underwent lysis of a saddle embolus.

The patient currently requires invasive ventilation support and is intubated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 142/69 to 143/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is still tachycardic with a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs with mild bibasilar crackles, distended abdomen, and 2+ peripheral edema with delayed capillary refill and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests with increased lactate levels. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium are within normal limits.

The patient's current assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure, hemodynamics post PEA arrest, mental status changes, saddle pulmonary embolism, acute renal"

   is not requiring any pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
   - Cont to trend Lactate, Cr, LFTs, as means to assess end-organ
   perfusion. Lactate and LFTs continue to trend down.
   - Cont CVVH as means to decrease preload burden on RV
   - Final repeat Echo read shows persistent RV strain with RV dilation
   with abnormal septal movement, hyperdynamic LV at EF 75% with a mild
   resting LVOT obstruction and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

   # Mental status:  Patient has been off sedation for approximately 24
   hours now.  She is able to open eyes to command, however unable to
   follow other simple commands.  If she does not develop improvement in
   her mental status tomorrow, will get CT scan tomorrow.  Will check
   ammonia level today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for bilateral pulmonary embolism in the setting of bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely secondary to severe acidosis and bilateral PE. She underwent lytic therapy for the saddle embolus and is currently on heparin drip to maintain a PTT of 60-80.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, hemodynamics post PEA arrest, mental status changes, saddle pulmonary emboli, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, shock liver/coagulopathy, troponin bump, and resolved hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory function, leading to increased reliance on respiratory support or development of further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hemodynamics post PEA Arrest: There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, including arrhythmias or another cardiac arrest due to ongoing strain on the right ventricle.
3. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status may continue to deteriorate if there is inadequate perfusion or if there are complications from sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: There is a risk of further emb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted for a bilateral pulmonary embolism in the setting of bowel resection and vaginal hysterectomy. The patient had a pulseless electrical activity arrest with a lysed saddle pulmonary embolus. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure due to an ischemic event. Her creatinine levels are improving with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and electrolytes are within normal limits. She will be transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) as per the renal plan.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation, which was likely due to fluid contraction caused by aggressive CVVH. It was controlled with Lopressor 5mg IV. Further TSH monitoring is needed, and there is no need for a repeat echo at this time. Switching to HD is planned as per the ARF plan.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure has resolved. She should continue to receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula as needed and be monitored for progress.

4. Saddle Pulmonary Emboli: The patient underwent lysis for the saddle pulmonary emboli and is currently on"

","Summary:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of PEA arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure. They have a history of arterial line insertion, EKG, and are currently on several medications including KCl, heparin sodium, and calcium gluconate through CRRT. The patient's vital signs indicate a stable blood pressure, normal heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Their temperature is slightly elevated. Review of systems shows no significant changes except for the mentioned conditions. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above and below. The patient's weight has increased since admission.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes altered mental status, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, chest pain, acute respiratory failure resolved, acute renal failure in the setting of severe hypoperfusion using CVVH switch to hemo today, transaminitis in the setting of profound hypoperfusion LFTs have peaked and are trending down, and thrombocytopenia potentially due to consumptive coagulopathy, medications, less likely HIT.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is PEA arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition appears to be critical, with multiple medical complications.

From the note, it can be inferred that the patient experienced a cardiac arrest, likely due to a pulmonary embolism. The patient received lytics and is currently on a heparin drip with good PTT, indicating that the clot has been treated successfully, and hemodynamics are resolved.

The patient also had acute respiratory failure, which has since resolved. The patient tolerated extubation well and is being weaned off supplemental oxygen.

Additionally, the patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) in the setting of severe hypoperfusion. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being used to manage this condition, with the goal of achieving a negative fluid balance of 1 liter per day. 

The patient also experienced transaminitis, which occurred in the setting of profound hypoperfusion. Liver function tests (LFTs) have peaked and are now trending down.

Furthermore, the patient developed thrombocytopenia, with a decreased platelet count. The possible causes include consumptive coagulopathy, medications, and less likely heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Persistent hypophosphatemia is also present and needs to be corrected. The patient will receive both intravenous and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of PEA arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing altered mental status, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and chest pain. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/71 mmHg to 168/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including KCl, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate, metoprolol, and others. The patient's recent lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of developing ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, elevated WBC count, and abnormal liver function tests may indicate an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in the ICU and the presence of PE suggest a potential risk for developing DVT.
