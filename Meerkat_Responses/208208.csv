   Assessment and Plan
   70yo woman admitted after mechanical fall with c/o cough, found to be
   hypotensive with LLL consolidation.
   # Hypotension:
   -          resolved quickly with IV fluids; no longer requiring
   pressors
   -          suspect that she was intravascularly dry in setting of
   infection
   -          continue to hold BP meds as her pressures are still in low
   110s systolic
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   -          note that DFA is positive for influenza; not a candidate for
   treatment given chronicity of symptoms (several weeks)
   -          respiratory droplet precautions
   -          suspect she may have presented with bacterial superinfection
   given that she acutely worsened over last 3-4 days, so will continue to
   treat with levofloxacin, but switch to PO
   -          note that patient is allergic to cephalosporins
   -          if fevers persist, would consider possible sinusitis given
   head CT findings
   # s/p fall:
   -          most likely from hypotension in setting of volume depletion

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for hypotension and left lower lobe consolidation. She was found to have a positive influenza B antigen test and is being treated for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's hypotension resolved with IV fluids, and she is no longer requiring pressors. She has a history of asthma, acute renal failure (resolved), hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with stable oxygen saturation and good glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
2. Influenza B Infection: Although the patient has tested positive for influenza B, it may complicate her existing respiratory condition and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension, which has since resolved, could be a sign of septic shock or another underlying condition that may recur if not properly managed.
4. Asthma: Although the patient's oxygen saturation is currently stable, her asthma could worsen due to respiratory infections or other triggers.
5. Chronic Microvascular Disease: The CT scan shows moderate diffuse white matter hypodensity most likely representing chronic microvascular disease. This condition can increase the risk of cerebrovascular events or cognitive decline.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (bacterial community-acquired), asthma, acute renal failure (resolved after volume resuscitation), hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate between 64-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65/23 mmHg to 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed hoarseness, crackles in the left lung base, and absent pulses in both right and left lower extremities. Neurological examination was not fully assessed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels were within normal range.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, monitoring glycemic control, providing prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of pneumonia, exacerbation of"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of influenza symptoms including fever, chills, and chronic cough. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, asthma, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, and GERD. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and receiving various treatments and medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Worsening of pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and the diagnosis of pneumonia indicate a respiratory infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to a worsening of the infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient has a history of asthma, which can be triggered or worsened by respiratory infections. This can cause difficulty in breathing and may require adjustment of the patient's asthma medication.
3. Acute renal failure progression: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. If not addressed promptly, acute renal failure could progress, leading to further impairment in kidney function.
4. Hypothyroidism management: The patient has hypothyroidism, and it is crucial to monitor and manage his thyroid hormone levels to avoid complications related to metabolism and other bodily functions.
5. GERD-related complications: GERD can lead to aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory issues if not managed effectively. Monitoring and treating the patient's GERD symptoms are important to prevent these complications.
6. Infection control: The patient's positive influenza B antigen test indicates an"

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with fevers, cough, malaise, weakness, and a mechanical fall. She presented with hypotension and left lower lobe consolidation. The patient tested positive for influenza B. She has a history of asthma, acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, and GERD.

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 102.3°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 79-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/50-106/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), levofloxacin, and other medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the mid-inspiratory phase of respiration, and her laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Imaging studies show no new findings, and her urine culture is negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory droplet precautions, symptom control with Tylenol, Tessalon pearls, guaifenesin, nebs, and continued treatment with levofloxacin for a 7-day course. The patient is also being treated for asthma, acute renal failure (resolved), hypothy"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient presents with respiratory distress and is currently on oxygen support in the ICU. They have a fever and a history of allergies to certain medications and substances. The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate, slightly low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%. They are overweight or obese. The physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, indicating possible pulmonary issues. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count, which may suggest infection or marrow suppression. The patient is being treated for respiratory failure, viral and bacterial pneumonia, asthma, and potential marrow suppression. They are receiving nutrition, insulin for glycemic control, and have lines and catheters in place for medical management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer protection. The patient's condition is critical."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of fevers, cough, malaise, and a fall. He was found to have lower left lobe consolidation in the emergency department and tested positive for influenza B. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, viral influenza, and possible bacterial superinfection. He is currently on supplemental oxygen, acetaminophen, Tessalon pearls, guaifenacin, nebulizers, chest physical therapy, daily chest X-rays, and droplet precautions. Vancomycin was started due to the possibility of bacterial superinfection. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which raises concern for a marrow process. Levofloxacin and sertraline were discontinued. The patient has a history of asthma, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and GERD. His current medications include captopril for blood pressure control, pantoprazole for GERD, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and he is receiving ICU care with regular cardiac/heart-healthy nutrition and good glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line inserted on 12/25 at 10:00 AM. Prophylactic measures include heparin subcutaneous for deep vein thrombosis, pantoprazole for stress ulcers, and no ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code,"

She has been treated with aztreonam and vancomycin for suspected Gram-negative bacterial infection, but no organisms have been identified in the sputum culture. Her symptoms include difficulty breathing, which has improved slightly, but she still requires supplemental oxygen.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/50 mmHg to 175/131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 115.6 kg, and she has gained 5.6 kg since admission. Her total fluid intake is 2,440 mL, with 520 mL given intravenously. Her urine output is 1,975 mL, and she has received 1,500 mL of intravenous fluids. Her blood products and stool output are noted, but there is no mention of NG or drain output.

She is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Fever curve improved, subjectively breathing easier but still with O2
   requirement.
   Given wheezing, will start short course of prednisone
 PNEUMONIA, VIRAL. Influenza B infection
   No oseltamivir given duration of sx at presentation
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   No bacterial source yet identified, ?L sided infiltrate concerning for
   bacterial superinfection
   Now on aztreonam/vancomycin ?whether levofloxacin was related to
   decreased WBC. Awaiting AM labs to f/u WBC count.
   Will repeat sputum culture (can
t induce [**12-22**] risk of bronchospasm)
   Clinically improved while on vancomycin so will complete 7day course,
   consider D/C aztreonam tomorrow
 ASTHMA
   Continue albuterol/altrovent, prednisone as above.
 Leukopenia
   Likely related to viral infection, but consider also meds
 vancomycin
   for example can be associated with neutropenia
 Hypertension
   Continue captopril
 Hypothyroidism
   Continue levothyroxine
 Depression
   Continue sertraline

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted with fever, chills, and cough. She has been treated with aztreonam and vancomycin for suspected Gram-negative bacterial infection, but sputum cultures have not shown any organisms. The patient denies shortness of breath but reports feeling better today. She has allergies to Ceclor (Cefaclor) and unknown allergens including grass pollen. Her medications include aztreonam, vancomycin, albuterol, heparin, ASA 325 daily, captopril 6.25 TID, levoxyl, protonix, simvastatin, and sertraline.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/50 to 175/131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is slightly overweight with a current weight of 115.6 kg.

Her fluid balance shows an intake of 2,440 mL with 520 mL given intravenously, and output totaling 1,975 mL including 700 mL through the Foley catheter. Her respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals crackles in her left lung and wheezing"

The patient is a 70-year-old male who presents with respiratory distress. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and pollen. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Aztreonam and Vancomycin) for an unknown bacterial infection. They are also on prophylactic heparin for DVT, an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and not on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving nebulizers and will start prednisone for asthma exacerbation.

The patient has an overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, and symmetric chest expansion with marked expiratory wheezing throughout some inspiratory wheezing. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. There are no peripheral edema or skin abnormalities noted.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 3.7 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and elevated platelet count of 158 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening respiratory distress or pneumonia.
2. Infection-related complications due to leukopenia and ongoing use of antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old overweight/obese female with respiratory distress. She has a history of allergies, including Ceclor (Cefaclor), grass pollen, standard unknown, and ragweed unknown. The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, viral and bacterial, community-acquired (CAP), asthma, and leukopenia. She is currently receiving antibiotics, specifically aztreonam and vancomycin, for the suspected influenza +/- bacterial pneumonia with asthma. She is also being given standing nebulizers (nebs) and will start oral Prednisone 40mg x 5 days to help with exertional dyspnea. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/68 to 175/131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of bronchial breath sounds with marked expiratory wheezing suggest a possible respiratory failure. This can occur due to severe airway obstruction or inadequate gas exchange.
2. Influenza Complications: Given the patient's presentation with respiratory distress and suspected influenza, there is a risk of developing complications such as pneumonia or exacerb"
