   Chief Complaint: chest pain
   24 Hour Events:
   Please see admission and transfer H&Ps and detailed daily notes from
   the CCU and [**Hospital Unit Name 2852**] teams. The patient is well-known to the CCU team.
   While on the floor, the patient was auto-diuresing while awaiting CABG
   planned for Friday [**2133-5-14**]. He had intermittent chest pain over the
   course of the day yesterday and overnight, and was triggered for this
   indication this morning. The interventional fellow and attending were
   made aware and the patient was taken to the cath lab for IABP
   placement, but he ultimately refused this and is transferred to the CCU
   for further care while awaiting CABG.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU, the patient denies any chest pain. He attributes
   his episode of chest pain today to moving around in bed and not to his
   cardiac status.

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who presented with chest pain. He has undergone several medical interventions including an elective laminectomy/discectomy, which was complicated by peri-operative NSTEMI. The patient has been diagnosed with 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and is awaiting coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

The patient's current condition includes intermittent chest pain without ECG changes, refusal of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), altered mental status, hypotension, right-sided pleural effusion, and decreased renal function.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 73 bpm
- Blood pressure: 109/55 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- General: Weak and fatigued appearing
- HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL/EOMI, sclera anicteric, MMM
- CV: RRR, nl S1-S2, no m/r/g
- PULM: Poor inspiratory effort, bibasilar crackles
