   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presenting with ventricular tachycardia storm and ICD firing. The patient was transferred for electrophysiological (EP) ablation.

The patient experienced frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight, which were helped by increasing the amiodarone drip. It is likely that the VT is originating from scar tissue, but the trigger is unclear. Cardiac enzymes were negative twice at the outside hospital, ruling out myocardial ischemia.

The patient underwent an EP study this morning, and attempts will be made to ablate VT. The patient was started on a low dose of metoprolol last night for frequent NSVT episodes.

Regarding the patient's medical conditions, the plan includes:
- Continuing beta-blockers and amiodarone.
- Considering discontinuing digoxin or reducing its dose due to an interaction with amiodarone.
- Maintaining electrolytes repleted.
- Avoiding adrenergic stimuli.

Other medical conditions and their management plans are as follows:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD): Ruled out for MI at OSH and no ischemic changes on EKG. Continue ASA, statin, Plavix, and beta-blocker.
- Hypertension (HTN): Well controlled with home regimen. Continue metoprolol.
- Hyperlipid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including VT storm, ICD firing, MMP, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD, diabetes, BPH, and CRI. He presented to the ICU with frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and a feeling of warmth. His allergies include atenolol, atorvastatin, carbamazepine, chlorhexidine, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone, propoxyphene, and Demerol (Meperidine Hcl). He has been receiving amiodarone, metoprolol, and other ICU medications. His review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has experienced some fluctuations in temperature and heart rate. His lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) ablation procedure due to VT storm and ICD firing. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening VT storm: The patient has a history of VT storm, which can potentially worsen if not properly managed.
2. Ischemic event: Although the patient has been ruled out for MI at the outside hospital and no ischemic changes on EKG were seen, there is still a possibility of an ischemic event triggering the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and ICD firing. 

During the night, the patient experienced frequent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), with the longest episode lasting 15 beats. He was started on low-dose metoprolol and the amiodarone infusion was increased to 1 mg/hr. The patient's electrolytes were also sent stat. In the morning, the patient felt warmth and the NSVT episodes decreased in frequency and eventually stopped. There were no correlating events with the patient's ICD firing.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 136/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring showed a slight decrease in fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including MMP (likely referring to mitral valve prolapse), VT storm (ventricular tachycardia), ICD firing (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The patient presented with VT storm and ICD firing, which required transfer for electrophysiology (EP) ablation. During the procedure, the patient developed chest pain and underwent coronary angiography, revealing lesions in the proximal and mid left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient was prescribed amiodarone (amio) for VT management and will continue beta-blockers.

The patient also has significant coronary artery disease (CAD) with lesions in the LCx, for which stenting was performed. He will require aspirin, statin therapy, and clopidogrel (plavix) for one year. The femoral ultrasound is planned to check for a potential pseudoaneurysm at the catheterization site.

Other medical issues include well-controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient is currently on various medications"

   Frequent episodes overnight, helped by increasing amiodarone drip.
   Likely that VT originating from scar tissue, but trigger unclear.
   Ruled out with negative cardiac enzymes x2 at outside hospital, but may
   have had an ischemic event. [**Month (only) 11**] be difficult to ablate given 2 recent
   amio loads, which likely also make recent shocks less effective.   Went
   to EP lab this AM, will have pacer interrogated again and attempt at VT
   ablation.  Started on low dose metoprolol last night for frequent NSVT
   episodes.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of multiple comorbidities, including MMP (presumably mitral valve prolapse), VT (ventricular tachycardia) storm leading to ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) firings, and other conditions such as CAD (coronary artery disease), HTN (hypertension), hyperlipidemia, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), atrial fibrillation (Afib), CRI (chronic renal insufficiency), OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), diabetes, and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia).

The patient presented with chest pain during an EP (electrophysiology) procedure, which was initially thought to be originating from the right ventricle. He was sent to the cath lab for further evaluation, where he received two drug-eluting stents in the proximal and mid-left circumflex arteries. The patient was started on amiodarone 200mg daily for observation, with plans to attempt VT ablation if he develops VT again. Metoprolol was also started for frequent nonsustained VT episodes.

The patient's allergies include atenolol, atorvastatin, carbamazepine, chlorhexidine, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone, propoxyphene, and demerol.

The patient's labs show elevated potassium levels at 5."

   68M with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing. Transferred for EP
   ablation, developed CP while in the lab and therefore went to the cath
   lab, at which point [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1285**] x2 were placed to his LCx
   # Hypoxia
 patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and
   large Right sided pleural effusion.  Patient
s hypoxia seems out of
   proportion to pneumonia and loculated pleural effusion; consider that
   he may have PE.  Appears that he had aspirated in EP lab.
   -          cont to treat pneumonia
   -          consider Interventional pulmonology consult to drain
   loculated effusion
   -          consider LENIs and/or D-Dimer
   -          F/u EP recs
   # Pneumonia
 patient has RLL pneumonia with effusion on CXR.
   Switched from Ceftriaxone/Azithro to Cefepime/Vanc yesterday for
   healthcare-associated pneumonia.  Decub Xray appears to show loculated
   effusion; not likely empyema, no fevers.  Appears to have aspirated in
   EP lab late last week.
   -          continue vanc/cefepime (day# 3 total abx ; day #2
   vanc/cefepime)
   -          add metronidazole for anaerobic coverage
   .
   # Acute kidney injury
 likely secondary to dye load post Cath, however
   may have pre-renal component.  Urine Eosinophils negative. FeUrea
   borderline.  Given 500cc fluids yesterday because of poor po intake and
   appeared dry on exam.  Creatine stable from yesterday.
   -                Hold ace inhibitor
   -                Continue to trend ; consider repeat urine lytes, may
   still be prerenal
 appeared to respond to fluids yesterday, though O2
   requirement increased
   # VTach-- Small runs of Vtach overnight.  He developed chest pain while
   in EP lab, and had a cath with [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1285**] to proximal and mid LCx 90% and 80%
   lesions.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including myocardial infarction (MMP), ventricular tachycardia (VT storm), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The patient presented with chest pain while in the electrophysiology (EP) lab and subsequently developed hypoxia, which is out of proportion to his known pneumonia and large right-sided pleural effusion. The patient may have also aspirated in the EP lab.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. The infection is being treated with antibiotics, but there is a concern for healthcare-associated pneumonia, so the antibiotic regimen has been changed. There is also a possibility of loculated effusion, which may require intervention from an interventional pulmonologist to drain.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia seems out of proportion to his pneumonia and loculated pleural effusion. This raises suspicion for a possible pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation with a D-dimer test and/or lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) is recommended.

3. Acute Kid"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hypertension. He presents with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. He was transferred for electrophysiological (EP) ablation but developed chest pain while in the lab and underwent coronary angiography, which revealed lesions in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient is currently in the ICU with the following assessments and plans:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. Antibiotic therapy will be switched from ceftriaxone/azithromycin to vancomycin/cefepime to cover healthcare-associated pneumonia. A decubitus film will be obtained to evaluate the size of the effusion and potential loculation.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient likely has AKI secondary to dye load during coronary angiography, with a possible pre-renal component. Further evaluation of serum urea nitrogen (FeUrea) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels is recommended. Maintenance fluids should be given if the patient does not take oral fluids. The patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT storm) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. 

During his stay in the ICU, the patient developed pneumonia and underwent electrophysiology (EP) ablation for VT. While in the EP lab, he experienced chest pain and had angiography performed, revealing 90% and 80% lesions in the proximal and mid left circumflex arteries. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and Plavix.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. His hypoxia seems out of proportion to the pneumonia and loculated pleural effusion. It is suspected that he may have a pulmonary embolism (PE). He is being treated for pneumonia and is under consideration for interventional pulmonology consult to drain the loculated effusion.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. He has switched from C"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Myocardial Myopathy presenting with ventricular tachycardia storm and ICD firing. He underwent electrophysiology (EP) ablation but developed chest pain while in the lab and was taken to the catheterization lab, where two stents were placed in his left circumflex artery.

The patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. He had aspirated in the EP lab. The plan is to continue treating pneumonia, repeat chest X-ray, attempt to get sputum cultures, evaluate for heart failure (HF) with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), consider steroids to check for COPD exacerbation, and consider thoracocentesis.

The patient also has acute kidney injury likely secondary to dye load post catheterization, but may have a pre-renal component. Urine eosinophils are negative, feUrea is borderline, and creatinine is stable from yesterday. The plan is to hold ACE inhibitors, consider repeat urine electrolytes, and evaluate with TTE for HF.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. He underwent electrophysiological (EP) ablation for VT but developed chest pain and was taken to the catheterization lab, where two stents were placed in the left circumflex artery (LCx).

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. He aspirated in the EP lab.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. He was switched from ceftriaxone/azithromycin to cefepime/vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Flagyl was added due to aspiration.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient likely has AKI secondary to dye load post-catheterization, although there may be a pre-renal component. His urine eosinophils are negative, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is borderline. Creatinine is stable from yesterday.
4. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced small runs of VT overnight. He developed chest pain while in the EP lab, and had a catheter placed in the prox"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of MMP (Mitral Valve Prolapse), who presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and ICD firing. He underwent electrophysiological (EP) ablation but developed chest pain and was taken to the catheterization lab for coronary angiography. Two stents were placed in his left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient has a known history of pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. He also has COPD exacerbation and pleural effusion in his past medical history. The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, ventricular tachycardia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia with a large right-sided pleural effusion, which can contribute to low oxygen levels in the blood.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has RLL pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. The switch from Ceftriaxone/Azithro to Cefepime/Vanc for healthcare-associated pneumonia suggests a possible"

   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with basal to mid inferolateral and inferior akinesis.
   Views are suboptimal so regional wall motion could not be fully
   assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
   directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Mitral regurgitation is not fully visualized. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presenting with ventricular tachycardia storm and ICD firing. He underwent electrophysiological (EP) ablation but developed chest pain while in the lab, leading to the placement of stents in his left circumflex artery. The patient has a known history of pneumonia with sputum culture pending, large right-sided pleural effusion, COPD exacerbation, and pleural effusion. His ejection fraction is 30%. The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, ventricular tachycardia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. These factors contribute to the patient's hypoxia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and ensuring adequate ventilation support are crucial.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. The switch from ceftriaxone/azithromycin to cefepime/vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia is appropriate. Aspiration in the EP lab may have contributed to the"

He underwent electrophysiology ablation but developed chest pain and was taken to the catheterization lab, where two stents were placed in his left circumflex artery. The patient has a known history of pneumonia, large right-sided pleural effusion, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for pneumonia, diuretics for fluid management, and anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has hypoxia due to pneumonia and pleural effusion. Imaging studies show moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild aortic regurgitation, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's acute kidney injury requires further evaluation, and his condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. Aspiration in the EP lab may have worsened his condition. Continued treatment for pneumonia and consideration of thoracocentesis to determine the etiology of the pleural effusion are recommended.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray. Switching antibiotics to cover"

   Imaging: CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in the patient
   after median
   sternotomy and CABG. The pacemaker leads are in unchanged position.
   There is no change in partially loculated right pleural effusion and
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Interstitial prominence is re-demonstrated still
   consistent with
   mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Left cardiophrenic angle was not
   included
   in the field of view.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with basal to mid inferolateral and inferior akinesis.
   Views are suboptimal so regional wall motion could not be fully
   assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
   directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Mitral regurgitation is not fully visualized. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   68M with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing. Transferred for EP
   ablation, developed CP while in the lab and therefore went to the cath
   lab, at which point [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1285**] x2 were placed to his LCx.
   # Hypoxia
 patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and
   large Right sided pleural effusion.  LENIs were negative on [**2191-1-24**].
   Upon contacting PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had multiple admissions prior for COPD
   exacerbation and pleural effusion.  Appears that he had aspirated in EP
   lab. No change in CXR. EF 30%. Likely secondary to pneumonia or
   pulmonary edema secondary to acute systolic HF or COPD exacerbation.
   OSH records not helpful.
   - cont to treat pneumonia
   - attempt to get sputum cultures
   - noncon CT chest
   - consider diuresis
   - consider thoracocentesis - beneficial in determining etiology
   # Pneumonia
 patient has RLL pneumonia with effusion on CXR.
   Switched from Ceftriaxone/Azithro to Cefepime/Vanc for
   healthcare-associated pneumonia.  Decub Xray appears to show loculated
   effusion; not likely empyema, no fevers.  Appears to have aspirated in
   EP lab late last week so added flagyl. Does not appear to be getting
   better. Should get thoracentesis to determine if need to place chest
   tube.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hypertension. 

The patient presented with a ventricular tachycardia storm and ICD firing, which led to his transfer for electrophysiological (EP) ablation. During the procedure, he developed chest pain and subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization, where two stents were placed in the left circumflex artery (LCx). 

The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, ventricular tachycardia, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, atrial fibrillation, OSA, diabetes, and BPH. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

   Imaging: CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in the patient
   after median
   sternotomy and CABG. The pacemaker leads are in unchanged position.
   There is no change in partially loculated right pleural effusion and
   adjacent
   atelectasis. Interstitial prominence is re-demonstrated still
   consistent with
   mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Left cardiophrenic angle was not
   included
   in the field of view.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
   size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with basal to mid inferolateral and inferior akinesis.
   Views are suboptimal so regional wall motion could not be fully
   assessed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
   aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
   directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Mitral regurgitation is not fully visualized. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   68M with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing. Transferred for EP
   ablation, developed CP while in the lab and therefore went to the cath
   lab, at which point [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1285**] x2 were placed to his LCx.
   # Hypoxia
 patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and
   large Right sided pleural effusion.  LENIs were negative on [**2191-1-24**].
   Upon contacting PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had multiple admissions prior for COPD
   exacerbation and pleural effusion.  Appears that he had aspirated in EP
   lab. No change in CXR. EF 30%. Likely secondary to pneumonia or
   pulmonary edema secondaty to acute systolic HF. OSH records not

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of MMP, presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and ICD firing. He underwent an electrophysiological (EP) ablation procedure but developed chest pain, leading to placement of stents in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient has a known history of pneumonia with sputum culture pending, large right-sided pleural effusion, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions including acute kidney injury (AKI), VTach, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, COPD, atrial fibrillation (Afib), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient's current medications include various antibiotics, beta-blockers, amiodarone, antiplatelet agents (ASA and Plavix), statins, and medications for diabetes and COPD.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia and a large right-sided pleural effusion, which may worsen his oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has RLL pneumonia with effusion on chest X-ray and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urine output"

He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. He underwent electrophysiology (EP) study and ablation, during which he developed chest pain and subsequently underwent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left circumflex artery (LCx).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, pneumonia, right lower lobe infiltrate with effusion, COPD exacerbation, acute kidney injury, and acute systolic heart failure. He is receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, diuretics, and inhaled bronchodilators.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pneumonia, development of empyema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further deterioration of kidney function, exacerbation of COPD, progression of heart failure, and potential arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   68M with MMP presents with VT storm and ICD firing. Transferred for EP
   ablation, developed CP while in the lab and therefore went to the cath
   lab, at which point [**Year (4 digits) 1285**] x2 were placed to his LCx.
   # Hypoxia
 patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and
   large Right sided pleural effusion.  LENIs were negative on [**2191-1-24**].
   Upon contacting PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had multiple admissions prior for COPD
   exacerbation and pleural effusion.  Appears that he had aspirated in EP
   lab. No change in CXR. EF 30%. Likely secondary to pneumonia or
   pulmonary edema secondary to acute systolic HF or COPD exacerbation.
   OSH records not helpful.  Amiodarone toxicity possible as well but
   unlikely.
   - cont to treat pneumonia
   - attempt to get sputum cultures
   - continue diuresis
   -pulmonary consult
   - ocean nasal spray for epistaxis from O2.
   -discuss with pulmonary, radiology the possibility of Amiodarone lung
   toxicity.
   - guaifenisen for cough.
   # Pneumonia
 patient has RLL pneumonia with effusion on CXR.
   Switched from Ceftriaxone/Azithro to Cefepime/Vanc for
   healthcare-associated pneumonia.  Decub Xray appears to show loculated
   effusion; not likely empyema, no fevers.  Appears to have aspirated in
   EP lab late last week so added flagyl. Does not appear to be getting
   better. Should get thoracentesis to determine if need to place chest
   tube.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl (day# 7 total abx; day #6
   vanc/cefepime; day#5 flagyl)
   - per above
   # Acute kidney injury
 ?dye load vs pre-renal.  Urine Eosinophils
   negative. FeUrea borderline.  Creatine stable from yesterday.
   - Hold ace inhibitor
   - trend daily cr
   # VTach - Small runs of VTach overnight.  He developed chest pain while
   in EP lab, and had a cath with [**Name10 (NameIs) 1285**] to proximal and mid LCx 90% and 80%
   lesions.
   - Medications per EP recs
   - continue b-blockers
   - continue amio
   - replete electrolytes as needed
   - avoid adrenergic stimuli
   # CAD: s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1285**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9743**] to proximal and mid LCx as above.  He will
   require plavix x 1 year.
   - Continue ASA
   - continue plavix
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue statin
   - consider adding ACEi when kidney function improves
   # HTN: Well controlled with home regimen
   - Continue beta blocker
   - consider adding ACEi when kidney function improves
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zetia/Simvastatin
   # COPD: Prior smoking history, intermittent O2 use at home, usually
   with CHF flairs.
   - O2 prn - wean as tolerated keeping SaO2 > 90%
   - Albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - continue antibiotics
   # Afib: Well rate controlled, currently A paced. On no anticoagulation
   although CHADS score is 6
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue plavix
   - no heparin gtt
   # OSA:
   - continue CPAP overnight as tolerated.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue home Novolog and Lantus
   - ISS
   # BPH:
   - Continue home medications

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and obstructive sleep apnea. He presents with ventricular tachycardia storm and ICD firing. He was transferred for electrophysiological (EP) ablation but developed chest pain while in the lab and underwent coronary angiography, which showed 90% and 80% lesions in the proximal and mid-left circumflex arteries. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has known pneumonia with sputum culture pending and a large right-sided pleural effusion. He appears to have aspirated in the EP lab. No change in chest X-ray (CXR). Ejection fraction (EF) is 30%. The cause is likely secondary to pneumonia or pulmonary edema secondary to acute systolic heart failure or COPD exacerbation. 

2. Pneumonia: The patient has right lower lobe pneumonia with effusion on CXR. He was switched from ceftriaxone/azithromycin to cefepime/vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Decub X-ray shows loculated effusion, not likely empyema. He may have aspirated in the EP lab,"
