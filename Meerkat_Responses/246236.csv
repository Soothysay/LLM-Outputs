   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12370**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and recent
   symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented to the ED with
   fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Patient had evidence of moderate sized effusion
   on bedside echo.  Pulsus paradoxus not elevated at 10 mm hg and no
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although pt had transient
   hypotension in ED responsive to fluids).  Effusion may be malignant
   (other cells seen on diff) versus infective (pericarditis).  Given no
   ST changes, elevated troponin, or chest pain, would favor malignant
   effusion over pericarditis/myocarditis.  No history of autoimmune
   disease.
   - continue to monitor vitals including pulsus
   - will give IV fluids and perform paracardiaocentesis if evidence of
   hemodynamic compromise
   - follow up on atypical/other cells
   - f/u set cardiac biomarkers
   .
   # Shortnes of breath: Likely from pulmonary edema caused by poor
   forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion.  CXR
   shows evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and
   cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent
   with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patient's symptoms correlate with
   onset in the past week.  Was recently given antibiotics for bronchitis
   and has fever, therefore infection (either lung primary or cardiac)
   should still be in the differential.
   - continue levofloxacin to cover CAP for now (febrile with
   leukocytosis)
   - try to obtain sputum cultures
   - follow blood cutlures
   - wean biPAP as tolerated
   - work up pericardial effusion as above
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved from yesterday after saline bolus.
   - Check urine lytes/osm
   - trend sodium
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged
   PR or QRS.  Etiology unclear as creatinine normal and not on
   diuretics.  [**Month (only) 8**] be from pseudohyperkalemia in setting of thrombocytosis
   (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal). Could
   consider tumor lysis or hypoaldosteronism.
   - add Ca, Mg, phos, LDH
   - consider checking uric acid or aldosterone/renin if w/u unrevealing
   - am ecg
   - urine potassium excretion
   .
   # Likely malignancy:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and recent symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia. She presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 98.4°F, blood pressure of 159/102 mmHg, pulse rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on bipap. Her physical examination reveals a fine jaw tremor, no wheezes or rhonchi, regular heart rhythm, tenderness to deep palpation in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), and no rebound tenderness or guarding.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, sodium of 154 mg/dL, potassium of 6 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and troponin-t of <0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values are also provided, including elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and atypical cells seen on the differential.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. These include pericardial effusion, shortness of breath, hy"

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12370**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and recent
   symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented to the ED with
   fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Patient had evidence of moderate sized effusion
   on bedside echo.  Pulsus paradoxus not elevated at 10 mm hg and no
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although pt had transient
   hypotension in ED responsive to fluids).  Effusion may be malignant
   (other cells seen on diff) versus infective (pericarditis).  Given no
   ST changes, elevated troponin, or chest pain, would favor malignant
   effusion over pericarditis/myocarditis.  No history of autoimmune
   disease.
   - continue to monitor vitals including pulsus
   - will give IV fluids and perform paracardiaocentesis if evidence of
   hemodynamic compromise
   - follow up on atypical/other cells
   - f/u set cardiac biomarkers
   .
   # Shortnes of breath: Likely from pulmonary edema caused by poor
   forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion.  CXR
   shows evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and
   cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent
   with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patient's symptoms correlate with
   onset in the past week.  Was recently given antibiotics for bronchitis
   and has fever, therefore infection (either lung primary or cardiac)
   should still be in the differential.
   - continue levofloxacin to cover CAP for now (febrile with
   leukocytosis)
   - try to obtain sputum cultures
   - follow blood cutlures
   - wean biPAP as tolerated
   - work up pericardial effusion as above
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improved from yesterday after saline bolus.
   - Check urine lytes/osm
   - trend sodium
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged
   PR or QRS.  Etiology unclear as creatinine normal and not on
   diuretics.  [**Month (only) 8**] be from pseudohyperkalemia in setting of thrombocytosis
   (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal). Could
   consider tumor lysis or hypoaldosteronism.
   - add Ca, Mg, phos, LDH
   - consider checking uric acid or aldosterone/renin if w/u unrevealing

   Imaging:

   CHEST: There has been no significant change since the prior chest
   x-ray. The
   heart remains enlarged. No gross failure is present but movement
   artifact is
   noted. A very severe scoliosis of the lumbar spine is again noted.
   IMPRESSION: No significant change.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
   CTA [**2110-5-2**]:
   1. Large pericardial effusion, apparently new compared to chest
   radiograph
   [**2109-2-5**].
   2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
   3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, possibly related to hydrostatic edema
   but
   not specific for this process.
   4. Mild hydrostatic edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions, left
   slightly larger than right.
   5. Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules. Given the patient's advanced
   age,
   follow- up is likely not warranted if there is no history of a primary
   malignancy.
   6. Focal opacity in the right lung apex, which appears to have been
   present
   on chest radiograph of [**2109-2-5**], and most likely reflects a scar.
   However,
   serial chest radiographs could be considered to exclude indolent
   infection if
   warranted clinically.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9539**] andhousestaff.
   I would add the following remarks:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). The note mentions several events and findings:

1. Hematology/Oncology review: Blasts were found in the patient's smear, suggesting a possible diagnosis of leukemia. The patient and family discussed further work-up, including a bone marrow biopsy, but they have not yet made a decision.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient presented with increased work of breathing and crackles on examination. They received 10mg IV lasix and made 400cc of urine over 4 hours, which improved their tachypnea.

3. Medical history: The patient has a history of hypertension, recent symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia, and fever and SOB that led to the current admission. Allergies, medications, and previous hospitalizations are documented in the medical records.

4. Review of systems: The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted abnormalities.

5. Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/68 to 164/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 340 mL and output of 1960 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1620 mL.

6. Respiratory support: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and is not intubated. The ABG results are pending.

7. Physical examination: Peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic assessments are not documented in the note. 

8. Labs and radiology: The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 656 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 656, creatinine (Cr) of 0.4, and troponin-T of <0.01. Other lab results, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA), reveal a large pericardial effusion, mild hydrostatic edema, and scattered pulmonary nodules.

9. Assessment and plan:
   - Pericardial effusion: The patient has evidence of moderate-sized effusion on bedside echo. Pulsus paradoxus is not elevated, and there is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The effusion may be malignant or infective. Further monitoring and paracentesis if hemodynamic compromise is observed.
   - Shortness of breath: Likely due to pulmonary edema caused by poor forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion. The patient's"

   CHEST: There has been no significant change since the prior chest
   x-ray. The
   heart remains enlarged. No gross failure is present but movement
   artifact is
   noted. A very severe scoliosis of the lumbar spine is again noted.
   IMPRESSION: No significant change.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
   CTA [**2110-5-2**]:
   1. Large pericardial effusion, apparently new compared to chest
   radiograph
   [**2109-2-5**].
   2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
   3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, possibly related to hydrostatic edema
   but
   not specific for this process.
   4. Mild hydrostatic edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions, left
   slightly larger than right.
   5. Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules. Given the patient's advanced
   age,
   follow- up is likely not warranted if there is no history of a primary
   malignancy.
   6. Focal opacity in the right lung apex, which appears to have been
   present
   on chest radiograph of [**2109-2-5**], and most likely reflects a scar.
   However,
   serial chest radiographs could be considered to exclude indolent
   infection if
   warranted clinically.
   Assessment and Plan
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (WITHOUT TAMPONADE)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12370**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and recent
   symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented to the ED with
   fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Patient had evidence of moderate sized effusion
   on bedside echo. Pulsus paradoxus not elevated at 10 mm hg and no
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although pt had transient
   hypotension in ED responsive to fluids).  Effusion may be malignant
   (other cells seen on diff) versus infective (pericarditis).  Given no
   ST changes, elevated troponin, or chest pain, would favor malignant
   effusion over pericarditis/myocarditis.  No history of autoimmune
   disease.
   - continue to monitor vitals including pulsus
   - will give IV fluids and perform paracardiaocentesis if evidence of
   hemodynamic compromise
   - follow up on atypical/other cells
   - biomarkers ruled out
   .
   # Shortnes of breath: Likely from pulmonary edema caused by poor
   forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion.  CXR
   shows evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and
   cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent
   with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patient's symptoms correlate with
   onset in the past week.  Was recently given antibiotics for bronchitis
   and has fever, therefore infection (either lung primary or cardiac)
   should still be in the differential. Lasix 10mg IV ONCE resulted in
   nearly 800cc negative from 6pm to MN.
   - Would consider repeating lasix 10mg IV ONCE
   - continue levofloxacin to cover CAP for now (febrile with
   leukocytosis)
   - try to obtain sputum cultures
   - follow blood cutlures
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - work up pericardial effusion as above
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Unclear etiology. Favor SIADH with superimposed
   euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia, however, improved after saline
   bolus. Urine osms/lytes suggest SIADH.
   - trend sodium
   - If worsens would free water restrict
   - Diuresis per above
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged
   PR or QRS.  Etiology unclear as creatinine normal and not on
   diuretics.  [**Month (only) 8**] be from pseudohyperkalemia in setting of thrombocytosis
   (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal). Could
   consider tumor lysis or hypoaldosteronism.
   - add Ca, Mg, phos, LDH
   - consider checking uric acid or aldosterone/renin if w/u unrevealing
   - am ecg
   - urine potassium excretion unrevealing
   .
   # Acute leukemia:  Work up next step would be BM bx. Hem/onc following.
   - Pt to decide today what next step is going to be
   - BMT recs, appreciate their input
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently 10 points lower than [**1-8**].  Increased WBC and
   platelets (3 cell lines abnormal) may be hematological malignancy.  Pt
   also known to have hemorrhioids. HCT trending down, but within limits
   of error.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension and recent symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia. She presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Pericardial effusion: Moderate-sized effusion on bedside echo. No evidence of hemodynamic compromise, but pulsus paradoxus not elevated at 10 mm Hg. No history of autoimmune disease. The cause of the effusion is unclear, with possibilities including malignant effusion versus infective pericarditis. No ST changes, elevated troponin, or chest pain, which makes malignant effusion more likely. Monitoring vitals, including pulsus paradoxus, and performing paracentesis if evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

2. Shortness of breath: Likely due to pulmonary edema caused by poor forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion. Chest X-ray shows evidence of cardiomegaly with widened mediastinum and cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. Symptoms correlate with onset in the past week. Repeated Lasix 10mg IV once resulted in nearly 800cc negative from 6pm to MN.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and has a history of taking ibandronate sodium, actonel (risendronate sodium), and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was given, and they are currently receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature within normal range, but there is a slight variation in blood pressure readings between measurements. The heart rate and respiratory rate are also within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is consistently at 99%.

The patient has a pericardial effusion without tamponade and respiratory failure, but not ARDS. The lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and potassium level. The creatinine level is within normal range, but there is a slight variation in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

The physical examination reveals that peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed. The patient's response to stimuli, movement, tone, and other parameters were also not assessed.

Overall, the patient's condition seems stable with ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to elevated white blood cell count, and potential cardiac issues related to the pericardial effusion. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to address these concerns."

   Assessment and Plan
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (WITHOUT TAMPONADE)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12370**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and recent
   symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented to the ED with
   fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial effusion and atypical
   cells on diff suggestive of blasts.
   .
   # Malignancy: Patient had blasts on peripheral blood differentiation.
   Also has pericardial effusion which is thought to be malignant.
   Heme/on was consulted (appreciate their input).  Given patient
s age
   and poor prognosis with AML? A confirmatory bone marrow biopsy may not
   be helpful.  Pt received blood transfusion yesterday
   - family meeting today to  discuss goals of care and make decision
   regarding definitive diagnosis with bone marrow or pericardial effusion
   biopsy
   - symptomatic treatment for now including transfusion Hct < 25, or
   platelet < 20
   # Pericardial effusion: Patient had evidence of moderate sized effusion
   on bedside echo. Pulsus paradoxus not elevated at 10 mm hg and no
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although pt had transient
   hypotension in ED responsive to fluids).  Initial differential
   diagnosis included malignant (other cells seen on diff) versus
   infective (pericarditis).  No history of autoimmune disease and no
   elevated BUN.  Differential showed presence of blasts indicating
   leukemia, supporting malignant effusion.
   - continue to monitor vitals including pulsus
   - will give IV fluids and perform therapeutic paracardiaocentesis if
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise
   - hematologic w/u as above
   .
   # Shortnes of breath: Likely from pulmonary edema caused by poor
   forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion.  Initial
   CXR showed evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and
   cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent
   with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lasix 10mg IV ONCE resulted in
   nearly 800cc negative from 6pm to MN.  Levofloxacin stopped yesterday
   given pt was afebrile and fever thought to be due to malignancy.
   - would have low threshold to restart levofloxacin for CAP
   - Lasix PRN for volume overload
   - try to obtain sputum cultures
   - follow blood cutlures
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - work up pericardial effusion as above
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving.  Unclear etiology. Favor SIADH with
   superimposed euvolemic to hypervolemic hyponatremia, however, improved
   after saline bolus. Urine osms/lytes suggest SIADH.
   - trend sodium
   - If worsens would free water restrict
   - Diuresis per above
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged
   PR or QRS.  Etiology unclear as creatinine normal and not on
   diuretics.  [**Month (only) 8**] be from pseudohyperkalemia in setting of thrombocytosis
   (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal). Could
   consider tumor lysis or hypoaldosteronism.
   - add Ca, Mg, phos, LDH
   - consider checking uric acid or aldosterone/renin if w/u unrevealing
   - am ecg
   - urine potassium excretion unrevealing
   .
   # Acute leukemia:  Work up next step would be BM bx. Hem/onc following.
   - Pt to decide today what next step is going to be
   - BMT recs, appreciate their input
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently 10 points lower than [**1-8**].  Increased WBC and
   platelets (3 cell lines abnormal) may be hematological malignancy.  Pt
   also known to have hemorrhioids. HCT trending down, but within limits
   of error.
   - repeat diff
   - guaiac stools
   - fe studies
 c/w anemia of chronic inflammation
   - Hemolysis labs
 unimpressive
   - trend hct
   - T+S
   - 2 PIVs

   # Thrombocytosis:
   As above, differential includes hematological maligancy.  Acute
   reactive process also in the DDX.
   - trend platelets
   - malignancy w/u as above
   .
   # AVNRT: Patient denied feeling palpitations in the ED.  She may have a

1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a moderate-sized pericardial effusion with evidence of poor forward left ventricular ejection. This could lead to cardiac tamponade and compromise of cardiac function.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary edema caused by the pericardial effusion. This can progress to severe respiratory distress and hypoxia.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has resolving hyponatremia with an unclear etiology. If not properly managed, it can lead to severe neurological complications such as seizures or coma.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which can be life-threatening"

   MICRO:
   Blood cx pending x 2
   Imaging:
   CXR [**2110-5-2**]:
   CHEST: There has been no significant change since the prior chest
   x-ray. The
   heart remains enlarged. No gross failure is present but movement
   artifact is
   noted. A very severe scoliosis of the lumbar spine is again noted.
   IMPRESSION: No significant change.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
   CTA [**2110-5-2**]:
   1. Large pericardial effusion, apparently new compared to chest
   radiograph
   [**2109-2-5**].
   2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
   3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, possibly related to hydrostatic edema
   but
   not specific for this process.
   4. Mild hydrostatic edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions, left
   slightly larger than right.
   5. Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules. Given the patient's advanced
   age,
   follow- up is likely not warranted if there is no history of a primary
   malignancy.
   6. Focal opacity in the right lung apex, which appears to have been
   present
   on chest radiograph of [**2109-2-5**], and most likely reflects a scar.
   However,
   serial chest radiographs could be considered to exclude indolent
   infection if
   warranted clinically.
   Assessment and Plan
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (WITHOUT TAMPONADE)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12370**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with past medical history of HTN and recent
   symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia who presented to the ED with
   fever and SOB and was found to have pericardial effusion and atypical
   cells on diff suggestive of blasts.
   .
   # Acute leukemia: Patient had blasts on peripheral blood
   differentiation.  Also has pericardial effusion which is thought to be
   malignant.  Heme/on was consulted (appreciate their input).  Given
   patient
s age and poor prognosis with AML? A confirmatory bone marrow
   biopsy may not be helpful.  Pt received blood transfusion yesterday
   - family meeting today to  discuss goals of care and make decision
   regarding definitive diagnosis with bone marrow or pericardial effusion
   biopsy
   - symptomatic treatment for now including transfusion Hct < 25, or
   platelet < 20
   # Pericardial effusion: Patient had evidence of moderate sized effusion
   on bedside echo. Pulsus paradoxus not elevated at 10 mm hg and no
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although pt had transient
   hypotension in ED responsive to fluids).  Initial differential
   diagnosis included malignant (other cells seen on diff) versus
   infective (pericarditis).  No history of autoimmune disease and no
   elevated BUN.  Differential showed presence of blasts indicating
   leukemia, supporting malignant effusion.
   - continue to monitor vitals including pulsus
   - will give IV fluids and perform therapeutic paracardiaocentesis if
   evidence of hemodynamic compromise
   - hematologic w/u as above
   .
   # Shortnes of breath: Likely from pulmonary edema caused by poor
   forward left ventricular ejection due to pericardial effusion.  Initial
   CXR showed evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and
   cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent
   with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Lasix 10mg IV ONCE resulted in
   nearly 800cc negative from 6pm to MN.  Levofloxacin stopped yesterday
   given pt was afebrile and fever thought to be due to malignancy.
   - would have low threshold to restart levofloxacin for CAP
   - Lasix PRN for volume overload
   - try to obtain sputum cultures
   - follow blood cutlures
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - work up pericardial effusion as above
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving.  Improved after saline bolus
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: EKG showed no evidence of peaked T waves or prolonged
   PR or QRS.  Etiology unclear as creatinine normal and not on
   diuretics.  [**Month (only) 8**] be from pseudohyperkalemia in setting of thrombocytosis
   (which corrects at 0.15 per 100K platelets above normal) however,
   hyperkalemia resolving and platelets still elevated.
   - urine potassium excretion unrevealing
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Anemia: Hct was initially 10 points lower than [**1-8**].  Was transfused
   1 unit. fe studies
 c/w anemia of chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs
   were unimpressive.
   - trend hct
   - T+S
   - 2 PIVs
   .
   # Thrombocytosis:
   - trend platelets
   - malignancy w/u as above
   .
   # AVNRT:
   - monitor tele
   - Vagal maneuvers, if no success - Adenosine
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - restarted atenolol
   .
   # abdominal pain: Resolved. Exam not very impressive for acute process,
   but AST/ALT and Alk phos elevated.
   .
   # depression:
   - continue citalopram
   .
   FEN: replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   Access: peripherals
   .
   Code: DNR/DNI patient confirmed

   Communication: Patient, daughter [**Name (NI) 2519**] [**Name (NI) 12370**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12371**]
   .
   Disposition: CCU for now, pending leukemia w/u
   .
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and recent symptoms of cough, weakness, and anorexia. She presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath and was found to have pericardial effusion and atypical cells on differential suggestive of blasts.

She has been diagnosed with acute leukemia and a pericardial effusion thought to be malignant. The heme/onc team was consulted, and given the patient's age and poor prognosis with AML, a confirmatory bone marrow biopsy may not be helpful. The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday and a family meeting today will be held to discuss goals of care and make a decision regarding definitive diagnosis with bone marrow or pericardial effusion biopsy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 94 bpm (83-105), blood pressure of 142/75 mmHg (92-151/61-78), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (14-29), and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a large pericardial effusion, apparently new compared to the previous chest X-ray. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, mild hydrostatic edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, and scattered sub-4 mm pulmonary nodules."
