   Assessment and Plan
   61yo woman with breast CA and brain metastases admitted with mental
   status changes and seizure.
   # Mental status change:
   Suspect secondary to seizure activity in patient with underlying CNS
   metastases.  Improving slowly, though continues to have significant
   expressive aphasia.  Although patient was initially given empiric
   treatment for meningitis, never had fever or evidence of infection, so
   antibiotics stopped.
 SEIZURE
   -          witnessed focal seizure activity at OSH
   -          awaiting EEG results
   -          appreciate input from neuron
   -          will continue keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -          if pt develops convulsive activity, will give ativan 2mg IV
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST with brain mets:
   -          appreciate input from radiation oncology and neuron-onc
   -          continue IV dexamethasone
   -          s/p whole brain radiation
   -          MRI brain with some improvement in tumor size following
   radiation, but will f/u final read
   -          Social work consult to help with family coping
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   New since [**Month (only) **]. No schistocytes noted on smear. HIT pending.  There
   are case reports of patients with thrombocytopenia on keppra, but
   unclear if truly implicated.  Phenobarbital can cause agranulocytosis
   or thrombocytopenia, and pt did receive Phenobarbital at OSH for
   control of seizures.
   -          f/u HIT Ab; avoid heparin products
   -          f/u PM platelets; no indication for transfusion unless pt
   starts bleeding or count < 10-20K
   -          will continue keppra for now but would consider stopping if
   platelets still going down tomorrow
   # Hyponatremia:
   -          this pt does have reason for SIADH, though at the moment,
   she is making a large amount of urine, which is not particularly
   consistent with SIADH picture
   -          suspect pt was admitted with dehydration, so low total body
   volume could have contributed
   -          recheck PM Na; if still low, would send urine lytes, Uosm,
   Posm
   # Heart Murmur:
   No longer present on exam today.
   TTE already done; will f/u read
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol if able to take POs

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with breast cancer and brain metastases admitted to the ICU for mental status changes and seizure activity. She has been experiencing expressive aphasia but can follow commands. Her vital signs are stable, and she has mild thrombocytopenia. The MRI shows a moderate decrease in perilesional edema in the left occipital lobe with some decrease in the size of the lesion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure control. EEG results are pending, and the patient will continue with the current seizure medication.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by a low platelet count. Further evaluation for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is planned, and the use of heparin products will be avoided.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and rechecking of plasma sodium levels is recommended. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) is suspected, but further investigation is needed.
4. Heart Murmur: The patient had a heart murmur present on admission but is no longer present on examination today. A follow-up cardiac echocardiogram (TTE) will be done to assess any changes.

s input, as well as the EEG [**Location (un) 308**].
   I suspect she will be ready for transfer out of the intensive care unit
   later today.
 THROMBOCTOPENIA
   This is concerning because we have not fully elucidated the etiology.
   HIT is pending and we are avoiding heparin products.  Although Keppra
   is possible, it is somewhat unlikely and her improved neurologic status
   suggests that Keppra is potentially beneficial here.  We will follow up
   labs and recheck platelets later today.  If they continue to fall (or
   do not improve in the next day or two), would consider trying a
   different AED than Keppra and consulting Hematology.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with breast cancer metastatic to the brain who presented with acute alteration of mental status and likely focal seizures. She has shown improvement in responsiveness and continues to be unable to verbalize. The patient's assessment includes seizure with status epilepticus, thrombocytopenia, cancer (malignant neoplasm), breast, and hypertension, benign.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned are as follows:
1. Seizure with status epilepticus: The patient's altered mental status and focal seizures indicate a neurological complication. If left untreated or poorly managed, seizures can lead to further brain damage, respiratory complications, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Thrombocytopenia: This refers to a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising. It is important to determine the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia and manage it appropriately to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), breast: The patient's breast cancer has metastasized to the brain. Complications related to cancer can include pain, neurological deficits, organ dysfunction, and decreased quality of life.
4. Hypertension, benign: Although the patient has hypertension, it is described as benign, suggesting that it is well-controlled. However, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke.
