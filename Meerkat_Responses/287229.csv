","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of cough, recently completed azithromycin, and given another antibiotic. She presented with confusion and vomiting, and a code stroke was called, but her head CT was negative. She has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 95, and a chest X-ray showed infiltrates. She was given antibiotics and hypertonic saline, and her EKG showed ST elevations anteriorly with a troponin level of.15. She has a history of hypertension and is taking avalide and HCTZ. She is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, suspected pneumonia, and EKG abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which can lead to various complications such as seizures, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, and altered mental status. It needs to be carefully managed to avoid further complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, chest X-ray findings, and elevated white blood cell count suggest pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening respiratory status, sepsis, and organ failure.
3. Myocardial infarction: The ST elevations on the EKG and elevated troponin levels indicate possible myocardial injury. If not appropriately managed, it can result in heart failure, arrhythmias, or even death.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: Given the patient"

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A small
   left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a
   very small secundum atrial septal defect. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction of the
   distal 2/3rds of the left ventricle and an apical aneurysm. Basal
   segments contract well. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
   (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There
   are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
   Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy or multivessel CAD. Right ventricular focal
   dysfunction. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Increased
   PCWP. Small secundum type atrial septal defect with left-to-right flow.
   CT Chest
   IMPRESSION: Multifocal consolidation and alveolitis consistent with
   widespread pneumonia. This is not the usual pattern for bacterial
   infection
   unless patient suffered widespread aspiration. It suggests an atypical
   organism including Legionella and mycoplasma.
   Mild cardiomegaly predominantly left ventricular, with mild left atrial
   enlargement. Atherosclerotic coronary calcification predominantly left
   main,
   anterior descending and circumflex branches.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and EKG changes. The patient's sodium levels are low, and there is concern for both hypovolemia and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone). The patient's renal function is also impaired, as indicated by the decreased hemoglobin concentration after fluid resuscitation. 

The patient has a history of systolic CHF and is suspected to have Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy or multivessel CAD. The patient's right ventricle shows focal dysfunction, and there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Additionally, a small secundum atrial septal defect with left-to-right flow is present. 

The patient's chest CT shows advanced multifocal pneumonia, which is not typical for bacterial infection but may be caused by an atypical organism such as Legionella or mycoplasma. The patient also has mild cardiomegaly predominantly left ventricular, with mild left atrial enlargement. Atherosclerotic coronary calcification is seen in the left main, anterior descending, and circumflex branches. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has critical hyponatremia, and a 3% saline infusion is being given at 25 ml/hr. Renal input is appreciated, and further recommendations will be provided.

2. Systolic CH"

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A small
   left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a
   very small secundum atrial septal defect. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
   normal. There is severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction of the
   distal 2/3rds of the left ventricle and an apical aneurysm. Basal
   segments contract well. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
   (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber
   size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There
   are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
   Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy or multivessel CAD. Right ventricular focal
   dysfunction. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Increased
   PCWP. Small secundum type atrial septal defect with left-to-right flow.
   CT Chest
   IMPRESSION: Multifocal consolidation and alveolitis consistent with
   widespread pneumonia. This is not the usual pattern for bacterial
   infection
   unless patient suffered widespread aspiration. It suggests an atypical
   organism including Legionella and mycoplasma.
   Mild cardiomegaly predominantly left ventricular, with mild left atrial
   enlargement. Atherosclerotic coronary calcification predominantly left
   main,
   anterior descending and circumflex branches.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including critical hyponatremia, EKG changes, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), leukocytosis, hypoxia, anemia, and mental status change. She has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has critical hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, cerebral edema, and respiratory failure if not corrected carefully.
2. Systolic CHF/Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: The patient's TTE results show severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and an apical aneurysm, consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition can cause pulmonary edema, acute heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammation. This may be due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or another source of infection.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, likely caused by multifocal pneumonia and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This can lead to respiratory failure and tissue hypoxia.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased after fluid resuscitation, which may be due to dilutional effects or other causes such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hemolysis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia and EKG changes. She has been diagnosed with systolic CHF, likely Takutsubos, diffuse ST elevations in V1-V4, and advanced multifocal pneumonia. The patient also has leukocytosis, anemia, and mental status changes. She is on various medications including heparin, H2 blocker, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and has decreased breath sounds bilaterally with good air movement only in the right upper lobe anteriorly. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has severe hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, or even death if not corrected carefully.
2. Systolic CHF/Takutsubos: The patient's systolic CHF may worsen, leading to further cardiac dysfunction and potential cardiogenic shock.
3. Multifocal Pneumonia: The advanced multifocal pneumonia may progress, causing respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Leukocytosis/Blood Infection: The patient's worsening leukocytosis suggests a possible blood infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, resulting in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia and EKG changes. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications, including systolic CHF, leukocytosis, hypoxia, anemia, and mental status changes. The patient's condition is complex, with several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can lead to seizures, confusion, and other neurological symptoms. Close monitoring and careful management are required to prevent complications.

2. Systolic CHF/Takutsubo Cardiomyopathy: The patient's heart is showing signs of systolic dysfunction, which may be due to Takutsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition can result in reduced cardiac output and may lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Leukocytosis/Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection. If not appropriately managed, this could progress to sepsis or septic shock.

4. Hypoxia/Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are low, and a CT scan revealed advanced multifocal pneumonia. If left untreated, this could worsen and lead to respiratory failure.

5. Anemia/Dilutional vs. GIB: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased, which could be due to dilutional effects"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia and EKG changes. The patient has a history of systolic CHF, likely Takutsubos, and diffuse ST elevations in V1-V4. The patient also has leukocytosis, hypoxia due to advanced multifocal pneumonia, and mental status changes likely related to hyponatremia. The patient received antibiotics for suspected CAP but may need broadening of antibiotics due to resistant bacteria. The patient is on various medications including heparin for DVT prophylaxis, an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and atrovent for cough. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 37°C, Tcurrent 36.1°C, HR 99 bpm, BP 99/52 mmHg, RR 25 insp/min, and SpO2 100%. The patient's labs show hyponatremia, elevated WBC count, and cardiac enzymes trending down. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with good air movement only in the right upper lobe anteriorly, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and alert neurologic status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has critical hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, neurological complications, and cardiac arrhythmias if not corrected appropriately.

2. Systolic CHF/T"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, which can lead to severe neurological complications if not corrected promptly. The use of hypertonic saline is recommended to correct the sodium imbalance.

2. Hypotension/AFib with RVR: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, and they have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This combination increases the risk of cardiogenic shock and poor tissue perfusion. The patient is currently on neo (presumably neoroleptics) to manage the blood pressure, but further evaluation and treatment for the underlying cause of hypotension is needed.

3. Systolic CHF/Takotsubo: The patient is exhibiting signs of systolic heart failure, likely due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and compromised cardiac function. Management strategies include beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and close monitoring.

4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by oliguria and increasing creatinine levels. Immediate measures to improve renal perfusion and address the underlying cause are necessary. Lasix has been given to promote diures"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been experiencing various medical complications, including hypotension, systolic CHF, leukocytosis, hypoxia, anemia, and mental status changes.

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management. The medical team is addressing multiple issues simultaneously, including correcting hyponatremia with hypertonic saline, managing hypotension with neo presses, treating systolic CHF, controlling heart rate with amiodarone, administering heparin for thrombus prevention, and addressing pneumonia.

The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, with low sodium (hyponatremia) and low hemoglobin (anemia). The patient also has leukocytosis, which is a high white blood cell count, but it is trending down. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is on antibiotics for suspected infections.

The patient's mental status changes are improving with the correction of hyponatremia. However, she still requires close monitoring and ongoing treatment for her multiple conditions. The patient is currently on a ventilator, receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula, and has multiple IV lines in place.

Overall, the patient's prognosis depends on the successful management of her complex medical conditions and her response to treatment. It is important to closely monitor her vital signs, electrolyte levels, and organ function to ensure appropriate"

   #  Hyponatremia. Improved through the day yesterday and off hypertonic
   saline but after fluid boluses (See below) did back track a little so
   back on hypertonic saline.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - 3% saline at 25 ml/hour given ideal body weight with q 4 hours [**Telephone/Fax (3) 6715**]
   checks with target 120 at midnight
   - if seizes, ativan, then bolus of 100cc of 3% saline
   - TSH wnl but cortisol still pending
   - holding home HCTZ
   # Hypotension: In setting of tachycardia/afib->likely HR related and
   cardiogenic. Now on Neo.
   - Started on amio gtt for pharmacologic conversion
   - Started on hep gtt per cards recs and will eventually need coumadin
   as high risk for clot given cardiomyopathy
   - Not responsive to IVF boluses and led to decreased Na so using
   pressors instead.
   - Attempt to wean pressors today and control HR with amio and beta
   blocker
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from beta blocker and ace inhibitor but will hold for
   now given hypotension and renal issues

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been experiencing hypotension, systolic CHF, leukocytosis, hypoxia, anemia, and mental status changes. The patient is currently on hypertonic saline, heparin, amiodarone, and norepinephrine infusions. She also has multiple lines and is on prophylactic medications for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and she will be staying in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, which can lead to severe neurological complications such as seizures, coma, and respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may indicate cardiogenic shock due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Systolic CHF: The patient's systolic heart function is compromised, leading to congestive heart failure symptoms. This can result in pulmonary edema, increased risk of arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If not appropriately managed, it could progress to sepsis or septic shock.
5. Hypoxia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dyslipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU due to unstable angina, which progressed to a myocardial infarction. The patient is currently experiencing hemodynamic instability, with fluctuating blood pressures and heart rates. He is on multiple medications, including heparin, amiodarone, and phenylephrine. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation. His blood work indicates elevated troponin levels and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is also experiencing acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's unstable hemodynamics, along with his history of myocardial infarction, suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. This is a life-threatening condition where the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate the possibility of AKI. This can be caused by factors such as hypotension, the use of nephrotoxic medications, or decreased renal perfusion.

3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - 3% saline now d/c
d as at goal of >120
   - TSH wnl, and cortisol appropriately elevated
   - holding home HCTZ
   - Q4H sodiums
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now on Neo with increasing requirements during the day but
   decreasing overnight. Did not respond to lasix although has ARF likely
   from ATN from hypotension.
   - d/c amio given shock liver
   - hep gtt recommended by cards as high risk for clot given
   cardiomyopathy, but given coagulopathy we held heparin
   - Not responsive to IVF boluses and led to decreased Na so using
   pressors instead.
   - Attempt to wean pressors today as able
   - [**Month (only) 11**] try vasopressin
   - goal MAP of 65.
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension.
   - d/c amio and other hepatotoxic meds.
   - send hepatitis viral studies
   - also has atypical appearing multifocal pna on CT and may have CMV/EBV
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   - RUQ U/S to ensure vessels patent
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up to 1.4. Likely from hypotension.
   - not responsive to 20mg IV lasix. Will attempt higher dose today and
   consider lasix gtt. If unable to produce urine and having volume
   overload issues or electrolyte imbalance may consider CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   - address hypotension/CHF as above
   # Mental Status Change: Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic
   encephalopathy and ICU delirium. Doubt hyponatremia as contributor
   given that with lower sodiums she was mentating better.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Consider lactulose as she is not stooling
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Blood cultures
   pending.  Flu swab negative.  Urine culture negative.
   - Check Cdiff
   - culture if spikes
   - Consider bronch for atypical-looking multifocal pneumonia
   - Consider CMV/EBV as above for transaminitis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc/zosyn although vanc
   level high today so no need for dose today
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from beta blocker and ace inhibitor but will hold for
   now given hypotension and renal issues
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily and hep gtt for risk of clot
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after
   d/c.
   # Hypoxia: CT Chest showed advanced multifocal pna and TTE showed
   takutsubos so likely multifactorial hypoxia. Now resolving.
   - VBG with lactate today
   - Consider bronch
   - Added atrovent
   - attempt to send Sputum cx
   - Wean O2 as possible
   - On vanc/unasyn (day [**4-4**]): Vanc level high this am so hold am dose.
   Check level tomorrow before dosing.
   # Anemia: Hct from 30->24->27->25.5->23 after fluid resuscitation.
   Likely dilutional
   - repeat hemolysis labs and coags
   - Guaiac stools as on heparin
   - Cycle hct daily
   - Transfuse for <21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma. It is important to closely monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust treatment accordingly.

2. Shock: The patient is experiencing decreased cardiac output, leading to poor tissue perfusion. This can result in organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated. The patient is currently on Neo (a medication) with increasing requirements during the day but decreasing overnight.

3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating liver injury. This could be due to shock liver from hypotension or other underlying causes. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent progression of liver damage.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has oliguric (reduced urine output) and an increasing creatinine level, suggesting kidney dysfunction. This is likely due to hypotension and possibly acute tubular necrosis. Appropriate fluid management and consideration of dialysis may be required.

5. Mental Status Changes: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be attributed to multiple factors such as hepatic encephalopathy, ICU delirium, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on hypertonic saline, pressors, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she continues to experience hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory distress. She also has acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, and anemia. The patient's mental status has been changing, and she requires close monitoring and care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, which can lead to seizures, confusion, and cardiac arrhythmias if not corrected carefully.
2. Hypotension/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's low blood pressure and irregular heart rhythm may result in inadequate perfusion to vital organs, increasing the risk of organ damage.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxia and pneumonia could worsen her respiratory status, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's oliguria and increasing creatinine levels indicate potential kidney damage, which can complicate fluid management and require renal support.
5. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, potentially indicating a risk for sepsis and associated complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's decreasing hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of worsening mental status and increasing pressor requirement. She has a history of multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient's current condition is characterized by hypotension, oliguria/anuria, pneumonia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status. She is receiving various ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with worsening mental status, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered laboratory values may indicate sepsis, possibly due to a hospital-acquired infection.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria, elevated serum creatinine levels, and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of AKI. This can be caused by factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as decreased breath sounds bilaterally with fine crackles at the bases, along with elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggest the possibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - 3% saline now d/c
d as at goal of >120
   - TSH wnl but cortisol appropriately elevated
   - holding home HCTZ
   - Q4H sodiums
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now on Neo with increasing requirements during the day but
   decreasing overnight. Did not respond to lasix although has ARF likely
   from ATN from hypotension.
   - On amio PO with better HR control yesterday but increasing neo
   requirements
   - Started on hep gtt per cards recs and will eventually need coumadin
   as high risk for clot given cardiomyopathy
   - Not responsive to IVF boluses and led to decreased Na so using
   pressors instead.
   - Attempt to wean pressors today as able
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension.
   - Consider checking viral studies as also has atypical appearing
   multifocal pna on CT and may have CMV/EBV
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   - Consider RUQ U/S to ensure vessels patent
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up to 1.4. Likely from hypotension.
   - not responsive to 20mg IV lasix. Will attempt higher dose today and
   consider lasix gtt. If unable to produce urine and having volume
   overload issues or electrolyte imbalance may consider CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   - address hypotension/CHF as above
   # Mental Status Change: Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic
   encephalopathy and ICU delirium. Doubt hyponatremia as contributor
   given that with lower sodiums she was mentating better.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Consider lactulose if not stooling
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from beta blocker and ace inhibitor but will hold for
   now given hypotension and renal issues
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily and hep gtt for risk of clot
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after
   d/c.
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Blood cultures
   pending.  Flu swab negative.  Urine culture negative.
   - Check Cdiff
   - culture if spikes
   - Consider bronch for atypical-looking multifocal pneumonia
   - Consider CMV/EBV as above for transaminitis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc/zosyn although vanc
   level high today so no need for dose today
   # Hypoxia: CT Chest showed advanced multifocal pna and TTE showed
   takutsubos so likely multifactorial hypoxia. Now resolving.
   - Consider bronch
   - Added atrovent
   - attempt to send Sputum cx
   - Wean O2 as possible
   - On vanc/unasyn (day [**5-5**]): Vanc level high this am so hold am dose.
   Check level tomorrow before dosing.
   # Anemia: Hct from 30->24->27->25.5->23 after fluid resuscitation.
   Likely dilutional
   - work up for hemolysis neg
   - Guaiac stools as on heparin
   - Cycle hct daily
   - Transfuse for <21

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU and is experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient has critical hyponatremia, likely due to a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and heart failure. This condition can lead to neurological symptoms and requires careful management to prevent further complications.

2. Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock with decreased cardiac output and non-responsiveness to intravenous fluids. This may be a result of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and requires close monitoring and treatment with vasopressors.

3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible shock liver from hypotension. This could be temporary and may improve with appropriate treatment of hypotension. Monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is oliguric with a rising creatinine level, suggesting ARF likely caused by hypotension. This can progress to renal failure if not treated promptly. Renal recommendations should be followed, including the use of higher doses of lasix and consideration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) if needed.

5. Mental Status Change: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, which could be multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill elderly woman with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints are PNA (pneumonia), hypotension, and hyponatremia. The patient has a worsening mental status, required increased pressor support, and has been given hypertonic saline. The patient also has oliguria/anuria (low urine output), and her central line was pulled off by the patient. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/67 to 70/11 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 2,463 mL and output of 323 mL since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 363 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 119 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 8645/[**Numeric Identifier 6783**], Alk Phos / TBili: 143/0.5, LDH: [**Numeric Identifier 6784**] IU/L).

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. The chief complaints include pneumonia, hypotension, and hyponatremia. 

The patient's mental status has been worsening, along with the need for increased pressor requirements. There have been issues with Lasix administration due to poor urine output. Hypertonic saline has been given, and the patient's internal jugular vein (IJ) was replaced on [date]. Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient's allergies include Lipitor, Pletal, Biaxin, and an unknown medication. Antibiotics given include Levofloxacin, Ampicillin, Vancomycin, and Ampicillin/Sulbactam.

The patient is currently on various infusions such as 3% NaCl, famotidine, ASA, atrovent, and Tessalon. Other medications include Neo 1.4 and other ICU medications. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for worsening mental status and increased pressor requirements. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate (HR) of 93 bpm with a normal range of 59-107 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 140/67 mmHg with a normal range of 70-140/82 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 34 breaths per minute with a normal range of 14-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,463 mL and output of 323 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of //19/. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.1 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 29.0 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 789 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.4 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.47 ng/mL, glucose level of 133 mg/dL, and other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/TBili, differential white blood cell count, fibrinogen level, lactic acid level, albumin level, LDH level, calcium level, magnesium level, and phosphate level.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill elderly woman with a chief complaint of pneumonia, hypotension, and hyponatremia. She has a history of worsening mental status, increased need for pressor support, and poor urine output. She also has elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea. Her blood work indicates anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care measures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's symptoms of hypotension, worsening mental status, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible severe infection leading to septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is necessary.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's pneumonia and low oxygen saturation, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can cause severe respiratory failure. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and respiratory status is essential.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria (reduced urine output) and elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential AKI. Monitoring fluid balance and renal function is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hepatic dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes suggest hepatic involvement. Continued monitoring of liver function tests and consideration of the underlying cause are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - 3% saline now d/c
d as at goal of >120
   - TSH wnl, and cortisol appropriately elevated
   - holding home HCTZ
   - Q4H sodiums
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now on Neo with increasing requirements during the day but
   decreasing overnight. Did not respond to lasix although has ARF likely
   from ATN from hypotension.
   - d/c amio given shock liver
   - hep gtt recommended by cards as high risk for clot given
   cardiomyopathy, but given coagulopathy we held heparin
   - Not responsive to IVF boluses and led to decreased Na so using
   pressors instead.
   - Attempt to wean pressors today as able
   - [**Month (only) 11**] try vasopressin
   - goal MAP of 65.
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension.
   - d/c amio and other hepatotoxic meds.
   - send hepatitis viral studies
   - also has atypical appearing multifocal pna on CT and may have CMV/EBV
   - Monitor LFTs
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   - RUQ U/S to ensure vessels patent
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up to 1.4. Likely from hypotension.
   - not responsive to 20mg IV lasix. Will attempt higher dose today and
   consider lasix gtt. If unable to produce urine and having volume
   overload issues or electrolyte imbalance may consider CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   - address hypotension/CHF as above
   # Mental Status Change: Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic
   encephalopathy and ICU delirium. Doubt hyponatremia as contributor
   given that with lower sodiums she was mentating better.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Consider lactulose as she is not stooling
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Blood cultures
   pending.  Flu swab negative.  Urine culture negative.
   - Check Cdiff
   - culture if spikes
   - Consider bronch for atypical-looking multifocal pneumonia
   - Consider CMV/EBV as above for transaminitis
   - Continue broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc/zosyn although vanc
   level high today so no need for dose today
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from beta blocker and ace inhibitor but will hold for
   now given hypotension and renal issues
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily and hep gtt for risk of clot
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after
   d/c.
   # Hypoxia: CT Chest showed advanced multifocal pna and TTE showed
   takutsubos so likely multifactorial hypoxia. Now resolving.
   - VBG with lactate today
   - Consider bronch
   - Added atrovent
   - attempt to send Sputum cx
   - Wean O2 as possible
   - On vanc/unasyn (day [**4-4**]): Vanc level high this am so hold am dose.
   Check level tomorrow before dosing.
   # Anemia: Hct from 30->24->27->25.5->23 after fluid resuscitation.
   Likely dilutional
   - repeat hemolysis labs and coags
   - Guaiac stools as on heparin
   - Cycle hct daily
   - Transfuse for <21

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has severe hyponatremia, which is likely due to a combination of pneumonia with SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) and heart failure. Renal input is appreciated, and the goal is to correct the sodium level to >120. The patient should be given 3% saline and TSH levels should be monitored.

2. Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock, as indicated by decreased CVP (central venous pressure) saturation and non-responsiveness to IV fluids. Neo (norepinephrine) has been initiated with increasing requirements during the day but decreasing overnight. The patient did not respond to lasix (furosemide), possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. Pressors are being used instead, and attempts will be made to wean them off today. Vasopressin may be considered if necessary.

3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver from hypotension. Amiodarone has been discontinued, and hepatitis viral studies have been sent. The patient may have atypical appearing multif"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has a history of diabetes and is currently in the ICU. Her vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and tachycardia. She has a central venous saturation of 53% and a heart rate of 76 bpm. She is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, diuretics, antibiotics, and cardiac support. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and kidney function abnormalities. She also has leukocytosis and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's decreased central venous saturation and non-responsiveness to intravenous fluids suggest cardiogenic shock. Monitoring the central venous saturation post-transfusion and considering vasopressor support if required are essential.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, which can lead to neurological complications. Careful management of her fluid balance and electrolytes is necessary.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes indicate a potential liver injury, likely due to shock. Monitoring liver function and addressing hypotension are crucial.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's oliguric state and rising creatinine levels suggest ARF, possibly from hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy. Renal dosing"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - TSH wnl, and cortisol appropriately elevated
   - Holding home HCTZ
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Cont fluid restriction
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now off pressors X >12hours. Fluid overloaded on exam.
   - F/U morning Cv sat.
   - If requires pressors Neo is best. 2^nd option would be vasopressin.
   - Would not give IVF as not responsive in past and lowers sodium
   - Would also hold lasix as not responsive to it and ARF
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension. Resolving today.
   - F/u pending hepatitis viral studies
   - Monitor LFTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up again today. Likely from hypotension
   vs contrast-nephropathy from CTA. Renal U/S nl. No urgent need for HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Address hypotension/CHF as above
   - Renally dose meds; amp/sulb dose decreased to q12h
   - If hyperkalemic or fluid overloaded may need to have CVVH
   # Mental Status Change: Not completely oriented but very conversant.
   Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic encephalopathy and ICU delirium.
   Doubt hyponatremia contributor any longer given that she was mentating
   better with lower sodiums.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Still has not stooled despite lactulose. Will increase dose today.
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Pt afebrile but is
   hypothermic. Blood cultures neg to date.  Flu swab negative.  Urine
   culture negative.
   - Repeat CBC this am as all lab values elevated and likely spurious;
   could consider Bcx and Ucx if still elevated
   - C. diff sent; CIS
   - Continue D4/7 broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc (dosed by levels)
   and unasyn
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from and ACE inhibitor but will hold for now given ARF
   - Started low dose beta blocker yesterday with good effect (HRs down to
   70s), uptitrate today
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily and hep gtt for risk of clot but cannot give hep
   gtt in setting of coagulopathy.
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after
   d/c.
   # Afib: Better rate controlled with beta blocker but still tachycardic
   - Uptitrate metoprolol today
   - Cannot give amio due to elevated LFTs
   # Anemia: Hct from 30->24->27->25.5->23 after fluid resuscitation.
   Likely dilutional
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - Repeat CBC this am because likely drew it too early as all lab values
   too high
   - Guaiac stools as on heparin
   - Cycle hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for <21

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has severe hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and even death if not corrected promptly and carefully.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This can result in decreased organ perfusion and potentially lead to organ failure.

3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by oliguria and rising creatinine levels. This can progress to full-blown acute kidney injury if not managed appropriately.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting liver injury. If left untreated or if the underlying cause is not addressed, it may progress to hepatic encephalopathy or fulminant hepatic failure.

5. Mental Status Changes: The patient is not completely oriented, indicating cognitive impairment. This can be due to various factors, including hepatic encephalopathy, ICU delirium, or electrolyte imbalances. Proper management is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Inappropriate antibiotic choices"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/73 to 83/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 56%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, elevated troponin T, decreased albumin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's ultrasound of the liver and kidneys was normal. The patient received blood transfusions and was weaned off Neo.

The patient has been diagnosed with shock, transaminitis, ARF, atrial fibrillation, anemia, pneumonia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status. The primary etiology of the shock appears to be cardiogenic. The patient's LFTs are trending down slightly, but infectious serologies are pending. The patient's creatinine levels are slowly rising, and they remain oliguric. Renal dosing of medications has been implemented. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with a beta-blocker, and the patient's anemia is being addressed post-transfusion.

The patient's ongoing issues include leukocytosis, which is being monitored, and the patient is at risk for complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and further deterioration of renal function.

The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill elderly woman who has been admitted to the ICU. The chief complaints include hypotension, renal failure, and shock liver. The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFIB), anemia, hypotension (not in shock), oliguria/anuria, pneumonia, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and altered mental status (not delirium).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results indicate abnormal values including leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.2 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lactate levels, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema, soft abdomen without rebound tenderness, and no wheezing in the chest. The patient is somnolent and not in delirium.

The plan includes continuing treatment for AFIB, managing hypotension, addressing renal failure, investigating the cause of transaminitis, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypotension, renal failure, and shock liver. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor, Pletal, Biaxin, and Doctor First Name 1506. The last doses of antibiotics given were ampicillin on 07/16/2021 at 10:00 AM, vancomycin on 07/17/2021 at 08:00 AM, and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) on 07/19/2021 at 04:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs show t-max of 36.6°C (97.9°F), current temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 107 bpm with a range of 68-119 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 124/73 mmHg with a range of 84-131/73-84 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 14-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation is 56%, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,320 mL with a total output of 310 mL.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.8 K/uL with a range of 14.8-24.5 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 24.1% with a range of 21.0-34.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 648 K/uL with a range of 206-645 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.2 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.22 ng/mL, glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and other lab values including elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated lactate, low albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient's assessment and plan include atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypotension (not in shock), oliguria/anuria, pneumonia, hyponatremia (low sodium, hyposmolality), and altered mental status (not delirium). The primary etiology of shock appears to be cardiogenic, and the patient has been unresponsive to fluid challenge or diuretics. The patient is currently on Neo and will have SCVO2 repeated when Neo is weaned to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 65, trend lactate, and mixed venous oxygen saturation.

Transaminitis is suspected due to shock liver, and the patient is hypotensive. A repeat RUQ US with dopplers will be performed, along with infectious serologies, as there are concerns about Takasubous, especially given the presence of atrial fibrillation. Hepatotoxic agents will be held, and repeat labs will be done in the afternoon with bilirubin and hemolysis panels.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is stable, with the patient remaining oliguric. Renal dosing of medications will continue, and vancomycin will be discontinued. A renal US with dopplers will be checked. Anemia is present, likely due to blood loss from line pulls and phlebotomy. The ongoing issues mentioned by the housestaff are noted, and ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is expected to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up again today. Likely from hypotension
   vs contrast-nephropathy from CTA. Renal U/S nl. No urgent need for HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Address hypotension/CHF as above
   - Renally dose meds; amp/sulb dose decreased to q12h
   - If hyperkalemic or fluid overloaded may need to have CVVH
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - TSH wnl, and cortisol appropriately elevated
   - Holding home HCTZ
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Cont fluid restriction
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now off pressors X >36hours. Fluid overloaded on exam.
   - If requires pressors Neo is best. 2^nd option would be vasopressin.
   - Would not give IVF as not responsive in past and lowers sodium
   - Would also hold lasix as not responsive to it and ARF
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension. Resolving today.
   - F/u pending hepatitis viral studies
   - Monitor LFTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   # Mental Status Change: Not completely oriented but very conversant.
   Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic encephalopathy and ICU delirium.
   Doubt hyponatremia contributor any longer given that she was mentating
   better with lower sodiums.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Still has not stooled despite lactulose. Will increase dose today.
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Pt afebrile but is
   hypothermic. Blood cultures neg to date.  Flu swab negative.  Urine
   culture negative.
   - Repeat CBC this am as all lab values elevated and likely spurious;
   could consider Bcx and Ucx if still elevated
   - C. diff sent; CIS
   - Continue D4/7 broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc (dosed by levels)
   and unasyn
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from and ACE inhibitor but will hold for now given ARF
   - Started low dose beta blocker yesterday with good effect (HRs down to
   70s), uptitrate today
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily and hep gtt for risk of clot but cannot give hep
   gtt in setting of coagulopathy.
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after
   d/c.
   # Afib: Better rate controlled with beta blocker but still tachycardic
   - Uptitrate metoprolol today
   - Cannot give amio due to elevated LFTs
   # Anemia: Hct from 30->24->27->25.5->23 after fluid resuscitation.
   Likely dilutional
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - Repeat CBC this am because likely drew it too early as all lab values
   too high
   - Guaiac stools as on heparin
   - Cycle hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for <21

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's condition is unstable with several potential medical complications that can arise. These include acute kidney injury (ARF), hyponatremia, shock, transaminitis, mental status changes, leukocytosis, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), anemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

1. ARF: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by increasing creatinine levels and oliguria. This may be due to hypotension or contrast nephropathy from a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA). Renal replacement therapy may be necessary if the condition worsens.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has severe hyponatremia, which is likely caused by a combination of pneumonia with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and heart failure. Sodium restriction and careful monitoring are required.

3. Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by decreased cardiac output and unresponsiveness to intravenous fluids. Pressors may be needed to maintain blood pressure. Vasopressin could be an alternative if needed.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver from hypotension. Hepatitis viral studies should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her condition is complicated by acute kidney injury, shock, transaminitis, mental status changes, leukocytosis, systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric renal function and rising creatinine levels indicate a potential AKI. This could be due to hypotension, contrast nephropathy from a recent CT angiography, or both.

2. Shock: The patient has shown signs of cardiogenic shock with decreased cardiac output and non-responsiveness to intravenous fluids. Pressors have been used to support blood pressure but may need to be reintroduced.

3. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes suggest a possible shock liver from hypotension. Monitoring liver function tests and treating hypotension are recommended.

4. Mental Status Changes: The patient exhibits altered mental status, likely multifactorial in origin. Causes may include hepatic encephalopathy, ICU delirium, or hyponatremia, but the latter is less likely given the patient's better mentation at lower sodium levels.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has a neutrophil-pred"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up again today. Likely from hypotension
   vs contrast-nephropathy from CTA. Renal U/S nl. No urgent need for HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Address hypotension/CHF as above
   - Renally dose meds; amp/sulb dose decreased to q12h
   - If hyperkalemic or fluid overloaded may need to have CVVH
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure. TSH wnl, and cortisol appropriately elevated.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - Holding home HCTZ
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Cont fluid restriction
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now off pressors X >36hours. Fluid overloaded on exam.
   - If requires pressors Neo is best. 2^nd option would be vasopressin.
   - Would not give IVF as not responsive in past and lowers sodium
   - Would also hold lasix as not responsive to it and ARF
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension. Resolving today.
   - F/u pending hepatitis viral studies
   - Monitor LFTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   # Mental Status Change: Not completely oriented but very conversant.
   Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic encephalopathy and ICU delirium.
   Doubt hyponatremia contributor any longer given that she was mentating
   better with lower sodiums.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Still has not stooled despite lactulose. Will increase dose today.
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Pt afebrile but is
   hypothermic. Blood cultures neg to date.  Flu swab negative.  Urine
   culture negative.
   - Repeat CBC this am as all lab values elevated and likely spurious;
   could consider Bcx and Ucx if still elevated
   - C. diff sent; CIS
   - Continue D4/7 broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc (dosed by levels)
   and unasyn
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from and ACE inhibitor but will hold for now given ARF
   - Started low dose beta blocker yesterday with good effect (HRs down to
   60s)
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily
   - Cards recommended hep gtt  but not given in setting of coagulopathy.
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 112/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and has decreased breath sounds bilaterally with fine crackles at the bases.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormality in the general, head/eye, ear, nose, and throat, or neurologic examinations. However, there is decreased bowel sound, bilateral edema, and radial pulses palpable but pedal pulses difficult to palpate. The patient is conversant but not completely oriented.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 26.1 K/uL, increased creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL, decreased hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 4220 IU/L. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), decreased albumin level, and elevated total bilirubin level. The electrolyte levels are as follows: sodium (Na+) at 128 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 4.5 mEq/L, chloride"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF), shock, transaminitis, mental status changes, leukocytosis, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARF, further deterioration of cardiac function leading to cardiogenic shock or CHF, development of hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction, progression of leukocytosis and subsequent infection, worsening of electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, and potential coagulopathy.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been dosed with vancomycin based on levels. The blood cultures are negative to date. Further management should include monitoring of renal function, cardiovascular status, electrolyte levels, liver function, and mental status. Appropriate measures to address hypotension, CHF, and fluid overload should be implemented. Renal dosing of medications should be considered, and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may arise if the patient becomes hyperkalemic or fluid overloaded. Restraints and haloperidol may be necessary for managing mental status changes. Additionally, close monitoring of the patient's blood glucose levels and glyc"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF) due to hypotension and contrast nephropathy from a computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient's sodium levels are low, likely from a combination of pneumonia with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) and heart failure. Her condition is complicated by shock, transaminitis, mental status changes, leukocytosis, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, electrolyte imbalances, cardiac dysfunction, infection, bleeding tendencies, and hepatic dysfunction. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment. Frequent reassessment of fluid balance, renal function, and electrolyte levels is necessary. The patient's mental status changes should be managed appropriately with restraints and antipsychotic medications as needed. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac function and ongoing management of her CHF and atrial fibrillation are crucial. Additionally, the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia should be addressed with appropriate interventions.

The patient's care requires a multidisciplinary approach involving critical care specialists, cardiologists, nephrolog"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2201-7-14**] and has been experiencing multiple medical complications. 

The patient's recent events include blood cultured at [**2201-7-19**] 09:50 PM and urine culture at [**2201-7-20**] 01:30 AM. The patient's medications have been uptitrated, including metop to 25mg tid, and vancomycin dose by level. The patient's leukocytosis with bandemia is still rising, and blood cx, U/A, and Ucx have been ordered. A chest x-ray has also been requested for the morning. The patient's creatinine continues to increase with decreased urine output, suggesting fluid overload, so IV fluids have been withheld. Urine electrolytes have been ordered. The patient's liver function tests have improved, although total bilirubin is elevated.

The patient has allergies to Lipitor, Pletal, Biaxin, and an unknown medication called [**Doctor First Name 1506**]. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on [**2201-7-17**] 08:00 AM, ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) on [**2201-7-19**] 04:00 AM, and ampicillin on [**2201-7-20**] 04:50 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 36.6 C (97.8 F), Tcurrent: 35.7 C (96.2 F), HR: 58 (52 - 112) bpm, BP: 112/58 (71) mmHg, RR: 18 (14 - 38) inspiratory/min, SpO2: 97%, heart rhythm: SB (Sinus Bradycardia), CVP: 8 (4 - 28) mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an O2 delivery device and has an ABG of ///18/. The patient's physical examination reveals NAD (normal appearing dermis), NC/AT dry mucous membranes, decreased breath sounds bilaterally with fine crackles at the bases, RRR (regular rate and rhythm) with no murmurs or gallops, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, no tenderness or guarding, bilateral lower extremity edema, radial pulses palpable bilaterally but pedal pulses difficult to palpate, and A+O2 saturation 1-2 but conversant.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 14.8 (23.1, 21.2, 24.5, 26.1, 25.7), hemoglobin of 12.0 g/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events, including blood cultures taken on 07/19/2022 at 09:50 PM and urine culture taken on 07/20/2022 at 01:30 AM. The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor, Pletal, Biaxin, and an unknown allergy to Doctor First Name 1506. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 07/17/2022 at 08:00 AM, Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) on 07/19/2022 at 04:00 AM, and Ampicillin on 07/20/2022 at 04:50 AM. The patient is currently receiving ICU medications through an 18-gauge line inserted on 07/14/2022 at 10:45 PM and a multi-lumen line inserted on 07/18/2022 at 03:08 AM. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia and an increase in Cr (creatinine) levels, which may indicate a possible infection. Blood cultures were ordered, and the patient is receiving antibiotics (Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Vancomycin, and Ampicillin). The presence of pneumonia is also noted in the assessment and plan. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms, is important.

2. Renal Function: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating a decline in renal function. The patient is oliguric/anuric, meaning they have decreased urine output. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is crucial. Considering the patient's condition, renal replacement therapy may be necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is essential to ensure adequate perfusion. Vasopressor support might be required to maintain blood pressure within the target range.

4. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but close monitoring of glycemic control is still necessary due to the patient's critical condition and potential for fluctuations in blood sugar levels.

5. Coagulation: The patient has an elevated PT/INR and PTT, indicating a coagulation abnormality. This may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering the need for blood product transfusion or reversal agents is important.

6. Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status. Continuous assessment of the patient's level of consciousness and cognitive function is necessary to detect any changes or deterioration.

7. Fluid Overload: The patient is believed to be fluid overloaded, as evidenced by the"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo F with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pna and takotsubos
   cardiomyopathy.
   # Shock: With decreased CVsat and non-responsiveness to IVF likely
   cardiogenic. Now off pressors X >12hours. Fluid overloaded on exam.
   - F/U morning Cv sat.
   - If requires pressors Neo is best. 2^nd option would be vasopressin.
   - Would not give IVF as not responsive in past and lowers sodium
   - Would also hold lasix as not responsive to it and ARF
   # Transaminitis: Likely shock liver from hypotension. Resolving today.
   - F/u pending hepatitis viral studies
   - Monitor LFTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Treat hypotension with pressors as above
   # ARF: Oliguric and Cr trending up again today. Likely from hypotension
   vs contrast-nephropathy from CTA. Renal U/S nl. No urgent need for HD.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Address hypotension/CHF as above
   - Renally dose meds; amp/sulb dose decreased to q12h
   - If hyperkalemic or fluid overloaded may need to have CVVH
   #  Hyponatremia. Likely from a combination of pneumonia with SIADH and
   heart failure.
   - Appreciate Renal input; f/u recs
   - TSH wnl, and cortisol appropriately elevated
   - Holding home HCTZ
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Cont fluid restriction
   # Mental Status Change: Not completely oriented but very conversant.
   Likely multifactorial [**3-2**] to hepatic encephalopathy and ICU delirium.
   Doubt hyponatremia contributor any longer given that she was mentating
   better with lower sodiums.
   - Restraints PRN
   - Haldol PRN
   - Still has not stooled despite lactulose. Will increase dose today.
   # Leukocytosis: Previously neutrophil-predominant. Pt afebrile but is
   hypothermic. Blood cultures neg to date.  Flu swab negative.  Urine
   culture negative.
   - Repeat CBC this am as all lab values elevated and likely spurious;
   could consider Bcx and Ucx if still elevated
   - C. diff sent; CIS
   - Continue D4/7 broad spectrum abx coverage with vanc (dosed by levels)
   and unasyn
   # Systolic CHF-> likely Takutsubos. BNP 29K
   - Would benefit from and ACE inhibitor but will hold for now given ARF
   - Started low dose beta blocker yesterday with good effect (HRs down to
   70s), uptitrate today
   - Monitor on tele
   - Aspirin 325 daily and hep gtt for risk of clot but cannot give hep
   gtt in setting of coagulopathy.
   - Cannot tolerate dopa/dobutamine as can cause LVOT obstruction with
   apical ballooning in takotsubos so on neo instead.
   - Appreciate cards recs. Will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] one month after
   d/c.
   # Afib: Better rate controlled with beta blocker but still tachycardic
   - Uptitrate metoprolol today
   - Cannot give amio due to elevated LFTs
   # Anemia: Hct from 30->24->27->25.5->23 after fluid resuscitation.
   Likely dilutional
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - Repeat CBC this am because likely drew it too early as all lab values
   too high
   - Guaiac stools as on heparin
   - Cycle hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for <21

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with critical hyponatremia, multifocal pneumonia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She is currently off pressors and appears to be fluid overloaded on examination. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has decreased CVP and has not responded to IV fluids in the past. Vasopressin may be considered as a second-line option if required. Fluid overload should be avoided.

2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which is likely due to shock liver from hypotension. This is resolving today, and hepatitis viral studies should be followed up. Pressors should be used to treat hypotension.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric ARF with increasing creatinine levels. This could be due to hypotension or contrast nephropathy from a recent computed tomography angiography (CTA). Renal ultrasound is normal, and there is no urgent need for hemodialysis. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be dosed accordingly. If the patient becomes hyperkalemic or fluid overloaded, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) may be necessary.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has severe hyponatremia, likely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypotension, oliguria/anuria, pneumonia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status.
- The patient was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to pneumonia and subsequent acute kidney injury.
- On admission, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin) and was also given metoprolol for hypertension control.
- Since admission, the patient's condition has been fluctuating with improvements in some parameters and deteriorations in others.
- Notable findings include leukocytosis with bandemia, rising creatinine levels, decreased urine output, improved liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated total bilirubin, and changes in vital signs.
- The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and their ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with an elevated pCO2 level.
- Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with fine crackles at the bases, tachycardia, rales in the lungs, edema in both lower extremities, and radial pulses that are palpable but pedal pulses difficult to palpate.
- Laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and altered liver function"

","The patient is an elderly woman with a chief complaint of hypotension and congestive heart failure (CHF). She has a history of allergies to certain medications and has been receiving treatment for various conditions including atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypotension, oliguria/anuria, pneumonia, hyponatremia, and altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 126/61 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is also on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH of 7.18. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and conversant but still confused. There are irregular heartbeats detected during the CV examination, and the patient has edema in her extremities. 

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels are within normal range. 

The patient's medical complications include cardiogenic shock with low ejection fraction, transaminitis, acute renal failure (likely due to acute tubular necrosis and contrast-induced nephropathy), atrial fibrillation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and hypoglycemia.

   1. Shock: primary etiology appears to be cardiogenic, with low EF and
   low SCVo2. However she has been able to come over pressors. Hopefully
   she is having some recovery of contractility and forward flow with time
   or we hit optinal filling status after blood.
   2. Transaminitis: LFTS trending down slightly today. primary DDx
   appears to be shock liver, as was hypotensive and on Neo, RUQ US with
   dopplers normal, infectious serologies pending, no obvious ingestions
   holding all  hepatotoxic agents
   3. ARF: ATN and contrast induced likely, slow rise in Cr, remains
   oliguric, renally dose all meds, d/c Vanco follow level in AM,
   Appreciate renal input
   4. Afib: off Amio given transaminitis- starting bblocker now that BPs
   better
   4. Anemia: s/p transfusion trend
   5. Leukocytosis: trend, cultures neg to date, senidng C diff , pan cx

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has received various treatments including antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are being monitored closely, showing fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also being closely monitored.

The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, altered mental status, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's kidney function is impaired, and he is oliguric (producing less urine). Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, hypotension, hyponatremia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF) and low stroke volume (SCVo2) suggest cardiogenic shock. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's hemodynamic status and provide appropriate interventions to maintain adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.

2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, indicating transaminitis. This could be due to shock liver or other causes. Monitoring liver enzymes and ruling out infectious or toxic causes of liver injury is essential.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF):"
