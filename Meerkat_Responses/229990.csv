","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart failure, admitted after an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. He was found to have a left ventricular apical clot while on heparin and underwent an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to concern for reversibility of severe systolic dysfunction complicated by hypotension and the need for continued respiratory support. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 mmHg to 85/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, glucose level of 99 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and platelet count of 207 K/uL. Imaging studies reveal an endotracheal tube tip approximately 5 cm above the car"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart failure who was admitted after an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. During the procedure, a left ventricular apical clot was found, leading to an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient's severe systolic dysfunction and hypotension required continued respiratory support.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 to 120/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on dopamine infusion and heparin sodium.

On the flow sheet, the patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 35/18 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 7.1 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 73%. The patient has received a total of 2,564 mL of fluids and has lost 4,190 mL of blood products and urine output. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart failure who was admitted after an elective cardiac catheterization for left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. He was found to have a large apical thrombus on heparin and underwent an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to concern for reversibility of his severe systolic dysfunction complicated by hypotension and the need for continued respiratory support.

The patient's current condition includes severe chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 9% and a large apical thrombus. He is hypotensive as well in the setting of sedation for intubation. The plan is to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with tandemheart placement today and may need transfer to a heart transplant center if there is no improvement. Heparin will be continued for thrombus treatment, and the patient will be monitored for input/output balance and daily weights. Beta blockers will be considered when tolerated, and dopamine will be weaned as tolerated.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with left main coronary artery and three-vessel disease seen on catheterization. He has been experiencing angina upon exertion, which has been increasing in frequency. Aspirin, simvastatin, and metoprolol will be continued, along with heparin. Tele will also be continued.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient was int"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the progress note history and physical examination on
   [**2196-1-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 4560**] above.  I was present during the
   pertinent portions of the physical examination today.   I concur with
   the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan outlined above.
   Approximately 50% allocated time involved coordination of care.
   MEDICAL DECISION MAKING.  This 51 year old man presented with dyspnea
   and cardiac catheterization demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
   disease.  The LVEF was 18%.  During induction for CABG, he was noted to
   have severe right and left ventricular dysfunction.   Surgery was
   aborted.  After discussions with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] re: timing of PCI and
   transplantation, the patient underwent PCI with DES to the left main
   and diagonal branches with Tandem Heart support in an effort to lessen
   the amount of hypernating myocardium and improve his LV function.   He
   was intubated post operatively for ventilatory support prior to the PCI
   procedure.  Following PCI, he has done well and was extubated this
   morning.   He has remained hemodynamically stable off pressors.

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted after an elective cardiac catheterization that revealed left main coronary artery disease and three-vessel disease. The patient had a left ventricular apical thrombus on heparin and underwent an aborted CABG due to concern for reversibility of his severe systolic dysfunction, complicated by hypotension and the need for continued respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic heart failure: The patient's severe systolic dysfunction and left ventricular apical thrombus increase the risk of further ischemic events and heart failure.
2. Coronary artery disease: The presence of three-vessel disease increases the risk of future coronary artery events, including angina, myocardial infarction, or the need for additional revascularization procedures.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Severe systolic dysfunction and the presence of a thrombus in the left ventricle can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential cardiogenic shock.
4. Venous thromboembolism: Immobility and decreased venous return due to heart failure can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Infection: Prolonged intubation and immunosuppressive therapy can increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse, who presented after an elective catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. He was found to have a left ventricular apical thrombus on heparin and underwent an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to severe systolic dysfunction and hypotension requiring continued respiratory support. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 37.6Â°C, Heart rate 89 bpm, Blood pressure 114/70 mmHg, Respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 90%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 1 mmHg, Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 38/19 mmHg, Cardiac output (CO) 9.4 L/min, Cardiac index (CI) 4.3 L/min/mÂ², Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) 1,400 dynes/s/cmâµ/mÂ².
- Fluid balance: Total input 4,330 mL, Total output 4,155 mL, Urine output 550 mL.
- Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode, Tidal volume (Vt) 600 mL, Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 50%, Respiratory system resistance (RSBI) 27, Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 11 cmH2O.
- Laboratory values: Hemoglobin (Hb) 12.7 g/dL, Hematocrit (Hct) 41.3%, Platelet count (Plt) 179,000/mmÂ³, Creatinine (Cr) 1.1 mg/dL, Blood glucose (Glucose) 95 mg/dL, Electrolytes (Na+: 141 mEq/L, K+: 4.1 mEq/L, Cl-: 107 mEq/L, HCO3-: 25 mEq/L, Ca2+: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg2+: 2.0 mg/dL, PO43-: 4.4 mg/dL).
- Echocardiogram: Severe depression of left ventricular systolic function, moderate-sized thrombus in the left ventricle, very small pericardial effusion (no signs of tamponade).

The patient has multiple medical complications that require attention:
1. Cardiomyopathy: severe chronic systolic heart failure with LVEF of 9% and large apical thrombus.
2. Coronary artery disease: LMCA and 3VD seen on catheterization, with previous treatment of DES to diagonal branch and left main coronary artery.
3. Respiratory: intubated in preparation for CABG, currently on spontaneous breathing trial and planned for extubation today.
4. Hyperlipidemia: continued on simvastatin.
5. Depression: holding bupropion while intubated, can restart when extubated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis from immobility and central venous catheterization.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac tamponade due to the small pericardial effusion and potential progression.
4. Recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina due to ongoing coronary artery disease.
5. Stroke or systemic embolism due to the presence of a left ventricular thrombus.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of these complications and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage them."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse. He was admitted for an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. During the procedure, a left ventricular apical thrombus was found, leading to an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient's severe systolic dysfunction complicated by hypotension required continued respiratory support.

The patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with tandem heart placement today. The tandem heart is a device used to temporarily assist the heart's pumping function. The patient also received stents in the diagonal branch and left main coronary artery. Post-procedure, the tandem heart was removed, and a follow-up echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion but revealed severely reduced left ventricular function. The patient received 130 mL of contrast during the procedure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 114/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600-850 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart disease. He was admitted after an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. During the procedure, a left ventricular apical clot was found, and the patient underwent an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to concerns about reversibility of severe systolic dysfunction. The patient experienced hypotension and required continued respiratory support.

24-hour events:
- The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement versus jacket in the setting of an ejection fraction (EF) less than 35%. It was decided to schedule him for ICD placement on Monday.
- The patient successfully extubated and had a swan transducer removed.
- He began taking captopril 6.25mg three times a day and metoprolol 12.5mg.
- The patient appeared well all afternoon and evening.
- He experienced generalized discomfort, and acetaminophen did not work, so ultram was given.
- The dose of metoprolol was increased to 25mg at night.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Last dose of antibiotics:
Infusions:
- Heparin sodium - 1,900 units/hour

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU after an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. On admission, he was found to have a left ventricular apical clot while on heparin and underwent an aborted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to concern for reversibility of severe systolic dysfunction, complicated by hypotension and the need for continued respiratory support.

24-hour events:
- The patient successfully extubated and had a swan transducer removed.
- He was started on captopril and metoprolol.
- The patient experienced generalized discomfort, and ultram was given as pain relief.
- The dose of metoprolol was increased.
- An electrophysiology (EP) consult was scheduled for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement or jacket in the setting of an ejection fraction (EF) less than 35%.
- The patient is NPO after midnight on Sunday for possible pacemaker placement.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies

Last dose of antibiotics:
- [No information provided]

Infusions:
- Heparin sodium - 1,900 units/hour

Other ICU medications:
- Furosemide (Lasix) - [Date] 09:00 AM

Other medications:
- Captopril 6.25 mg three times a day (TID)
- Metoprolol 12.5 mg [Hospital1 7]"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) and heart failure (HL) who was admitted after an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and triple vessel disease. During the procedure, a left ventricular apical clot was discovered, leading to an aborted coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to concerns about the reversibility of severe systolic dysfunction and hypotension. The patient experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), lost consciousness, and converted prior to shock. It is unclear if he lost pulses during the event. The patient is currently scheduled for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 94/63 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable but requires ongoing monitoring and support.

The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, which may contribute to his cardiomyopathy and severe chronic systolic heart failure. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 9% with a large apical thrombus noted. This finding is consistent with his history of severe CAD but also accounts for his EtOH abuse.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   50-year-old male with HTN, HL admitted after an elective cath with LMCA
   disease and 3VD, found to have a given LV apical clot on heparin, now
   s/p aborted CABG due to concern for reversibility of his severe
   systolic dysfunction complicated by hypotension, polymorphic VT,
   scheduled for ICD placement.
   #. Cardiomyopathy: severe chronic systolic heart failure. TTE shows
   LVEF of [**9-2**]% with LV diameter of 7cm. Large apical thrombus noted.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to severe CAD but also has history of EtOH abuse. Now
   extubated and off pressors. S/p PCI with no need for extrended
   tandemheart.
   - heparin gtt for thrombus
   - I/Os, daily weights
   - captopril 6.25mg TID
   - metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - ICD placement - NPO p MN
   - Heparin gtt for thrombus

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension and heart failure, admitted to the ICU after an elective cardiac catheterization due to left main coronary artery disease and three-vessel disease. He was found to have a left ventricular apical clot while on heparin and underwent an aborted CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) due to concerns about reversibility of severe systolic dysfunction complicated by hypotension and polymorphic VT (ventricular tachycardia). The patient is scheduled for ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) placement.

The patient experienced a polymorphic VT lasting for approximately one minute, during which he lost consciousness. It is unclear if he lost his pulses, but he spontaneously reverted. His QT interval is slightly prolonged.

The patient has been febrile, but the fever has subsided overnight. His chest X-ray and urinalysis are unrevealing. Blood cultures have been obtained, and if positive, the central line will be discontinued.

The patient has a history of angina upon exertion, which has been increasing in frequency. He underwent a diagnostic and left main coronary artery stenting with a right radial approach. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, clopidogrel, heparin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and telehealth monitoring.

The patient was intubated in preparation for CABG but is now extubated without issues. His respiratory status"
