   A/P: 66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD,
   PVD with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension.
   # Obtundation: dramatic response to narcan, likely secondary to renal
   dysfunction and standing morphine.  Hold narcotics.
   -use narcan 0.1mg - 0.2mg IV prn somnolence
   -use haldol or zydis for agitation post narcan
   -treat hypoglycemia, plan for HD tomorrow tentatively
   # Hypotension: given hypoglycemia, leukocytosis and multiple sources of
   infection this is possible sepsis.  other possibilities include
   narcotic overdose given initial report of pinpoint pupils.
   -cultured HD line in ER, peripheral cultures
   -repeat Bcx in a.m.
   -wound vac to lower extremity
   -u/a negative, ucx pending
   -cxr w/ possible LUL infiltrate, repeat CXR in a.m., send sputum
   culture
   -broad abx: dapto / zosyn (last dose tomorrow [**2116-6-19**])
   -hold standing narcotics for now
   -stress dose steroids hydrocort 25mg IV q6hrs (if he becomes
   hypotensive again, currently normotensive) and continue home prednisone
   5mg qhs
   -remove PICC line and culture tip
   # Hypoxia: no hypoxia
   -normal EF on [**2116-6-10**], 2+ TR and 1+ AI, no report of diastolic
   dysfunction but given that he is a dialysis patient he likely has
   diastolic dysfunction
   -fluid removal w/ HD when BP stable, for now will have to supplement O2
   as maintaining BP
   -possible pna but more likely pulm edema, f/u a.m. cxr
   -for COPD continue standing nebs q6hrs and prn albuterol q2 hrs
   # ESRD: HD on T/Th/Sa, missed dialysis on admission day.
   -d/w renal HD tomorrow
   # altered mental status:
   -likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to hypoglycemia for his
   second episode of altered mental status.  Will correct these and w/u
   for leukocytosis.  Also will discontinue digoxin.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   -continue home meds dig 0.125mg qHD
   -hold lopressor overnight, start in a.m. if BP is stable
   -normal EF but likely diastolic dysfunction given that he is a dialysis
   patient
   # hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   -has had insulin levels in the past which have been low [**10-15**], C
   peptide was normal (elevated to 4.8 on [**10-7**]), Insulin Ab which was
   negative, insulin like growth factor-1 which was negative and IGF
   binding protein - 2 that was high.
   -send insulin level and c peptide level during hypoglycemia, confirm
   low BG on FS with serum glucose level
   -send TSH

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The patient responded dramatically to narcan, indicating a likely secondary renal dysfunction and standing morphine overdose. Narcotics have been held, and narcan has been administered as needed for somnolence.

The patient's hypotension could be due to hypoglycemia, leukocytosis, and multiple sources of infection, possibly sepsis. Other possibilities include narcotic overdose given the initial report of pinpoint pupils. Cultures have been obtained from the HD line and peripheral sites. Blood cultures will be repeated in the morning. A wound vacuum has been applied to the lower extremity, and an ultrasound (U/S) will be performed to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's hypoxia is being managed with supplemental oxygen. Fluid removal will be done with HD when the patient's blood pressure is stable. Possible pneumonia is being followed up with an additional chest X-ray.

ESRD management includes HD on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and the patient missed dialysis on admission day. Renal HD is planned for tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD,
   PVD with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension.
   # Obtundation: presented with pinpoint pupils and had a dramatic
   response to narcan, thus likely secondary to renal dysfunction and
   standing morphine.   Has received 5 doses of 0.1 mg and also responded
   to 0.05 mg this morning. Will continue to follow and dose as necessary
   -use narcan 0.05mg - 0.1mg every hour IV prn somnolence
   -use haldol or zydis for agitation post narcan
   -treat hypoglycemia
   -Currently receiving HD
   # Hypotension: unlikely that hypotension was real given normal
   dopplered pressures, but had leukocytosis  and multiple sources of
   infection, cannot rule out sepsis.  other possibilities include
   narcotic overdose given initial report of pinpoint pupils.
   --Dopplered blood pressure has been normal.
   --Has blood cultures including HD cath culture pending, follow up urine
   culture
   --Continue current antibiotics for now
   --repeat CXR without evidence of pneumonia
   --home prednisone, d/c stress steroids
   # Hypoxia: has variable oxygen requirement, with occasional drops to
   85% on RA, now on 1L NC.   Goal sat 88-92%
   -normal EF on [**2116-6-10**], 2+ TR and 1+ AI, no report of diastolic
   dysfunction but given that he is a dialysis patient he likely has
   diastolic dysfunction
   -fluid removal w/ HD when BP stable, for now will have to supplement O2
   as maintaining BP
   -for COPD continue standing nebs q6hrs and prn albuterol q2 hrs
   # ESRD: HD on T/Th/Sa, missed dialysis on admission day, currently
   receiving HD. Follow up renal recs
   # altered mental status:
   -likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to hypoglycemia for his
   second episode of altered mental status.  Evaluation and treatment as
   above. Appears to be at baseline MS this morning after narcan, continue
   narcan.  Also will discontinue digoxin.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   -continue home meds dig 0.125mg qHD
   -restart 12.5 mg metoprolol as BP is stable.
   # hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   -has had insulin levels in the past which have been low [**10-15**], C
   peptide was normal (elevated to 4.8 on [**10-7**]), Insulin Ab which was
   negative, insulin like growth factor-1 which was negative and IGF
   binding protein - 2 that was high.
   -Insulin and C-peptide levels pending from admission BG of 25.
   -send TSH
   -continue prednisone at bedtime, 5mg po qhs
   -w/u for leukocytosis as above, continue antibiotics
   -q2 hour fingersticks, continues to have D50 requirement (5 amps since
   arrival)
   -consider endocrinology consultation
   # PVD s/p TMA debridement: has wound vac.  Continue, possible source of
   infection.
   -Vascular consult for further management
continue current antibiotics
   -Foot X-ray pending
   # LUE edema: u/s negative on left side, right UE DVT seen, right upper
   extremity ultrasound pending. Likely HD cath related.
   FEN: NPO for now, monitor electrolytes, continue vitamins

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer. He presented with confusion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient has received multiple doses of narcan for somnolence and responded to 0.05 mg this morning. He is currently receiving HD and has been treated for hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Obtundation: The patient presented with pinpoint pupils and had a dramatic response to narcan, suggesting possible secondary renal dysfunction and standing morphine. He requires ongoing monitoring and treatment with narcan every hour as needed for somnolence.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure has been normal after receiving IV fluids, the possibility of sepsis or narcotic overdose cannot be ruled out. Blood cultures, including the HD catheter culture, are pending, and the current antibiotics should be continued.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has variable oxygen requirements, with occasional drops to 85% on room air. He is currently on a nasal cannula and will be supplemented with oxygen to maintain a goal saturation of 88-92%. COPD management includes standing nebs q6hrs and prn albuter"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD
   with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension with recent admission concering for
   infected HD catheter (early [**2116-6-8**]) which was changed over a wire
   (growing out VRE) then new line sited. Picture complicated by med
   effects from narcotics and end stage renal disease with a missed HD on
   [**6-18**].  Now with concern for new source of sepsis (awaiting clx data)
   > Hypotension /  Leukocytosis:  recent VRE HD line sepsis still on
   treatment with  Daptomycin. Will need to check peripheral and HD line
   cultures as well as his mid line (and remove the lateral). His TMA is
   also a potneital souce although was OK on last admit. No obvious path
   on CT abd/pel and CXR is unchanged. Given hx would favor broad coverage
   (Pip-tazo and Daptomycin). No linezolid secondary to chronic low counts
   Also possible steroid deficiency with this new septic source.
   - stop stress dose steroids (systolic BP is OK on Doppler), go back to
   5 mg prednisone
   - Daptomycin and Pip Tazo penign clx data
   - F/u clx as above
    > Hypercarbia: hx of COPD,  hypercarbic in setting of sepsis and
   increased metabolic production of CO2. Target SaO2 90-93%.
   - follow ABG. Good response to naloxone
   - BiPAP if needed (hypercarbi and not responding to narcan)
    > ESRD:  Clx off HD line and T, Th, Sat HD
   > Altered mental status:   likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to
   hypoglycemia for his second episode of altered mental status, in
   addition to hypercarbia and med effect (narcotics.    Also will benefit
   from HD today as he missed his usual dose. .
   - follow ABG
   - support for infection as above
   - Cont naloxone
   - Haldo for agitation.
   > Atrial fibrillation: Digoxin not indicated (although seemes to work
   given his normal TTE), Will hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   > hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   > Left upper extremity swelling: will f/u read of the US
   > PVD s/p TMA debridement: has wound vac.  Continue, possible source of
   infection.  s/p surgery on [**5-11**]. Has known peripheral vascular disease.
   Tissue culture without growth on culture. Was seen on [**5-22**] by Dr.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, presenting with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The patient has a history of infected HD catheter, which was changed over a wire (growing out vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus or VRE) and then a new line was sited. The patient also has a TMA ulcer that is potentially a source of infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, presenting with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. He has a recent history of an infected HD catheter, which was changed over a wire due to a suspected infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He is currently being treated for sepsis with daptomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but there are concerns about a new source of infection. Other issues include hypoxia, ESRD, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, hypoglycemia, and PVD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis with daptomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, there are concerns about a new source of infection, which could lead to further complications.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of COPD and may be hypercarbic in the setting of sepsis and increased metabolic production of CO2. This can result in respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. ESRD: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, presenting with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The patient has a history of an infected HD catheter, which was changed over a wire due to suspected vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection. There are concerns for a new source of sepsis, and the patient is currently being treated with daptomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's TMA is also a potential source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Leukocytosis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis could indicate ongoing sepsis, possibly from the HD catheter or another source. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is recommended.
2. Hypercarbia: The patient's history of COPD and increased metabolic production of CO2 during sepsis may result in hypercarbia. BiPAP may be necessary if the patient does not respond to naloxone.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing HD, and the HD line should be cultured to identify any potential infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and altered mental status. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) on Saturday and there were concerns about deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A repeat venous ultrasound (VU) confirmed a nonocclusive thrombus in the right proximal subclavian vein extending into the right internal jugular vein (RIJ). There is no administration of heparin due to high bleeding risk. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 81/33 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 79 bpm, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and has a SpO2 of 95%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 65, PaO2 of 31, and bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 36. The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 5.0 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed nonocclusive thrombus in the right proximal subclavian vein extending into the right internal jugular vein (RIJ). This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, uncertain chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, presenting with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU.

24-hour events include plans for HD on Saturday, upper extremity swelling concerning for a clot in the superior vena cava (SVC) or central stenosis. If a clot is associated with the catheter, the line will need to be re-sited to the left and an SVC evaluation in interventional radiology (IR) will be done at that time. The patient also has a nonocclusive thrombus in the right proximal subclavian into the right internal jugular vein (RIJ), but no heparin is given due to high bleeding risk. The patient received narcan and then became agitated, so zyprexa was given. There is also a concern about potential cortical irregularity and osteomyelitis in the right foot, which is healing appropriately with a wound vac in place. Antibiotics were stopped as there does not appear to be an infection. Stress dose steroids have been discontinued, and metoprolol 12.5 mg has been started. The patient is now on a regular diet, and palliative care consultations have been initiated per family request.

Allergies include violent reactions to Neupogen, unknown reactions to Neurontin, and hives from Dilaudid. The last doses of antibiotics were Daptomycin on 06/18/2116 at 09:30 PM, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 06/19/2116 at 08:00 PM. Current infusions include naloxone (narcan) on 06/19/2116 at 02:00 PM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) on 06/19/2116 at 11:59 PM, and morphine sulfate on 06/20/2116 at 03:26 AM. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 815 mL and a total output of 1,515 mL, with a negative balance of -700 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent, with an ABG showing pH of 7.27, PCO2 of 65 mmHg, and PO2 of 31 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be somnolent, with minimal responsiveness to verbal stimuli. There are anicteric sclera, dry mucous membranes, and pupils that are equal, round, and reactive to light. The neck is supple and without jugulo-diagastric venous distention. The heart is irregularly irregular with soft heart sounds and no murmurs. The lungs show coarse bilateral bibasilar rales. The abdomen is obese with soft, nontender, nondistended bowel sounds, and no rebound or guarding. Extremities reveal a right foot that has been amputated with a wound vac in place, and no pitting edema. Skin shows diffuse ecchymosis in the upper extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient to be somnolent, arousable, and moving arms.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.9%, leukocyte count of 7.2 K/uL, platelet count"

The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, PVD with recent TMA ulcer. The patient presented with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal: The patient has nonocclusive thrombus in the right proximal subclavian into the right internal jugular vein (RIJ). There is a concern for clot in the superior vena cava (SVC) or central stenosis. If the clot is associated with the catheter, re-site the line to the left and consider SVC evaluation in interventional radiology (IR).
2. Respiratory: The patient has hypoxia with variable oxygen requirements. There are occasional drops to 85% on RA, now on 50% FiO2 face tent due to presumed volume overload. Plan for HD today, reassess after additional volume removal. If persistent O2 requirement, consider repeat chest X-ray. Goal sat 88-92%.
3. Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation and hypotension. It is unlikely that hypotension was real given normal dopplered pressures. The patient tolerated HD yesterday. Continue home meds dig 0.125mg qHD and restart 12.5 mg metoprolol as BP is stable.

   66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD
   with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension.
   # Obtundation: presented with pinpoint pupils and had a dramatic
   response to narcan, thus likely secondary to renal dysfunction and
   standing morphine.   Has received 5 doses of 0.1 mg and also responded
   to 0.05 mg this morning. Will continue to follow and dose as necessary
   -use narcan 0.05mg - 0.1mg every hour IV prn somnolence
   -use haldol or zydis for agitation post narcan
   -treat hypoglycemia
   -Currently receiving HD
   # Hypotension: unlikely that hypotension was real given normal
   dopplered pressures, but had leukocytosis  and multiple sources of
   infection, cannot rule out sepsis.  other possibilities include
   narcotic overdose given initial report of pinpoint pupils.
   --Dopplered blood pressure has been normal.
   --Has blood cultures including HD cath culture pending, follow up urine
   culture
   --Continue current antibiotics for now
   --repeat CXR without evidence of pneumonia
   --home prednisone, d/c stress steroids
   # Hypoxia: has variable oxygen requirement, with occasional drops to
   85% on RA, now on 1L NC.   Goal sat 88-92%
   -normal EF on [**2116-6-10**], 2+ TR and 1+ AI, no report of diastolic
   dysfunction but given that he is a dialysis patient he likely has
   diastolic dysfunction
   -fluid removal w/ HD when BP stable, for now will have to supplement O2
   as maintaining BP
   -for COPD continue standing nebs q6hrs and prn albuterol q2 hrs
   # ESRD: HD on T/Th/Sa, missed dialysis on admission day, currently
   receiving HD. Follow up renal recs
   # altered mental status:
   -likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to hypoglycemia for his
   second episode of altered mental status.  Evaluation and treatment as
   above. Appears to be at baseline MS this morning after narcan, continue
   narcan.  Also will discontinue digoxin.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   -continue home meds dig 0.125mg qHD
   -restart 12.5 mg metoprolol as BP is stable.
   # hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   -has had insulin levels in the past which have been low [**10-15**], C
   peptide was normal (elevated to 4.8 on [**10-7**]), Insulin Ab which was

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer. He presented with confusion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient responded to narcan (naloxone) administration, suggesting opioid overdose as a possible cause for his altered mental status. He also showed signs of hypoxia and required supplemental oxygen. The patient has been receiving HD and has been diagnosed with a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). His recent foot X-ray revealed cortical irregularity and osteomyelitis cannot be excluded, with vascular calcifications present. He is currently on multiple medications, including morphine sulfate, dextrose, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and multiple sources of infection raise concerns about sepsis. It is important to closely monitor his vital signs and continue appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's repeated episodes of hypoglycemia need to be addressed. Further investigation is required to determine the cause, which could include medication error, surreptitious insulin use, or an underlying endocrine disorder.

","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint remains unchanged. There are several significant findings in the 24-hour events section of the progress note. Firstly, the patient is scheduled for hemodialysis on Saturday to return to their regular dialysis schedule. There is concern for a possible clot in the superior vena cava (SVC) or central stenosis. If a clot is present and associated with the catheter, it will be necessary to re-site the line to the left and perform an SVC evaluation in interventional radiology at that time. Additionally, a repeat venous blood gas reveals a pH of 7.27, which indicates acidosis. The patient has a nonocclusive thrombus in the right proximal subclavian vein extending into the right internal jugular vein. However, no heparin has been given due to a high bleeding risk. The patient also experienced agitation after receiving narcan, so zyprexa was administered. X-rays of the right foot show cortical irregularity and osteomyelitis cannot be excluded, along with vascular calcifications. The patient's foot is healing appropriately, and the wound vacuum will be replaced. Antibiotics have been prescribed according to previous plans, but there does not appear to be an infection. Stress dose steroids have been stopped, and metoprolol 12.5 mg has been started. The patient is now on a regular diet. Palliative care consultation has been initiated per family request.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and hypotension. He responded to naloxone, indicating a possible narcotic overdose. The patient received multiple doses of narcan and dextrose 50% for hypoglycemia. His vital signs include a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 81/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a shovel mask. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of allergies to Neupogen, Neurontin, and Dilaudid. He was on various medications including nephrocaps, B12, ASA 325, digoxin, simvastatin, prednisone 5mg, Plavix 75mg, atrovent, albuterol, lopressor 12.5mg, and zyprexa prn.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for AMS and hypoglycemia. His fluid balance shows a negative balance of 700 mL and his respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a face tent with an ABG result of /31. Physical examination reveals no apparent distress, but the patient is not oriented and occasionally follows commands. He appears cushingoid and has bruising on his skin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). He has altered mental status (AMS) and is suspected to have experienced a possible narcotic overdose. The patient has been given naloxone multiple times, and his hypoglycemia was treated with D50W. The plan includes dialysis today, completion of antibiotics, and further evaluation for infection, renal failure, and hypoglycemia. The patient is not taking oral intake due to AMS and will be started on D10W at 30cc/hour. Considering the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) is also being considered. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is completing antibiotics today, indicating a current or recent infection. This could potentially lead to complications if not effectively treated.
2. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is undergoing dialysis today. Complications related to dialysis, such as line-associated thrombosis, need to be monitored.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia was treated but the etiology is unclear. If not properly managed, recurrent hypoglycemic episodes may occur.
4. Narcotic overdose: Although naloxone has been administered, the possibility of ongoing narcotic effects or further overdose needs to be considered and managed appropriately.

   A/P: 66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD,
   PVD with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension.
   # Obtundation: presented with pinpoint pupils and had a dramatic
   response to narcan, thus likely secondary to renal dysfunction and
   standing morphine.   Has received 5 doses of 0.1 mg and also responded
   to 0.05 mg this morning. Will continue to follow and dose as necessary
   -use narcan 0.05mg - 0.1mg every hour IV prn somnolence
   -use haldol or zydis for agitation post narcan
   -treat hypoglycemia
   -Currently receiving HD
   # Hypotension: unlikely that hypotension was real given normal
   dopplered pressures, but had leukocytosis  and multiple sources of
   infection, cannot rule out sepsis.  other possibilities include
   narcotic overdose given initial report of pinpoint pupils.
   --Dopplered blood pressure has been normal.
   --Has blood cultures including HD cath culture pending, follow up urine
   culture
   --Continue current antibiotics for now
   --repeat CXR without evidence of pneumonia
   --home prednisone, d/c stress steroids
   # Hypoxia: has variable oxygen requirement, with occasional drops to
   85% on RA, now on 1L NC.   Goal sat 88-92%
   -normal EF on [**2116-6-10**], 2+ TR and 1+ AI, no report of diastolic
   dysfunction but given that he is a dialysis patient he likely has
   diastolic dysfunction
   -fluid removal w/ HD when BP stable, for now will have to supplement O2
   as maintaining BP
   -for COPD continue standing nebs q6hrs and prn albuterol q2 hr
   # ESRD: HD on T/Th/Sa, missed dialysis on admission day, currently
   receiving HD. Follow up renal rec
   # altered mental status:
   -likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to hypoglycemia for his
   second episode of altered mental status.  Evaluation and treatment as
   above. Appears to be at baseline MS this morning after narcan, continue
   narcan.  Also will discontinue digoxin.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   -continue home meds dig 0.125mg qHD
   -restart 12.5 mg metoprolol as BP is stable.
   # hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   -has had insulin levels in the past which have been low [**10-15**], C
   peptide was normal (elevated to 4.8 on [**10-7**]), Insulin Ab which was
   negative, insulin like growth factor-1 which was negative and IGF
   binding protein - 2 that was high.
   -Insulin and C-peptide levels pending from admission BG of 25.
   -send TSH
   -continue prednisone at bedtime, 5mg po qhs
   -w/u for leukocytosis as above, continue antibiotics
   -q2 hour fingersticks, continues to have D50 requirement (5 amps since
   arrival)
   -consider endocrinology consultation
   # PVD s/p TMA debridement: has wound vac.  Continue, possible source of
   infection.
   -Vascular consult for further management
continue current antibiotics
   -FootX-ray pending
   # LUE edema: u/s negative on left side, right UE DVT seen, right upper
   extremity ultrasound pending. Likely HD cath related.
   FEN: NPO for now, monitor electrolytes, continue vitamins

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transfusion-associated myocardial injury (TMA) ulcer. He presented with confusion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes somnolence, hypotension, hypoglycemia, ESRD, atrial fibrillation, PVD, and lower extremity edema. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may be experiencing adrenal insufficiency, which could be causing his hypoglycemia and somnolence. This condition needs to be addressed promptly.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: Although the patient's electrolytes are currently within normal limits, it is important to monitor them closely as imbalances can occur in critically ill patients.
3. Infection: The presence of coarse bilateral crackles in the lungs may indicate a possible infection, which needs to be further evaluated.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a right upper extremity DVT, likely related to the hemodialysis catheter. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD,
   PVD with recent TMA ulcer, presents with confusion in the setting of
   hypoglycemia and hypotension.
   # Obtundation: presented with pinpoint pupils and had a dramatic
   response to narcan, thus likely secondary to renal dysfunction and
   standing morphine.   Has received 5 doses of 0.1 mg and also responded
   to 0.05 mg this morning. Will continue to follow and dose as necessary
   -use narcan 0.05mg - 0.1mg every hour IV prn somnolence
   -use haldol or zydis for agitation post narcan
   -treat hypoglycemia
   -Currently receiving HD
   # Hypotension: unlikely that hypotension was real given normal
   dopplered pressures, but had leukocytosis  and multiple sources of
   infection, cannot rule out sepsis.  other possibilities include
   narcotic overdose given initial report of pinpoint pupils.
   --Dopplered blood pressure has been normal.
   --Has blood cultures including HD cath culture pending, follow up urine
   culture
   --Continue current antibiotics for now
   --repeat CXR without evidence of pneumonia
   --home prednisone, d/c stress steroids
   # Hypoxia: has variable oxygen requirement, with occasional drops to
   85% on RA, now on 1L NC.   Goal sat 88-92%
   -normal EF on [**2116-6-10**], 2+ TR and 1+ AI, no report of diastolic
   dysfunction but given that he is a dialysis patient he likely has
   diastolic dysfunction
   -fluid removal w/ HD when BP stable, for now will have to supplement O2
   as maintaining BP
   -for COPD continue standing nebs q6hrs and prn albuterol q2 hrs
   # ESRD: HD on T/Th/Sa, missed dialysis on admission day, currently
   receiving HD. Follow up renal recs
   # altered mental status:
   -likely secondary to hypoxia initially and to hypoglycemia for his
   second episode of altered mental status.  Evaluation and treatment as
   above. Appears to be at baseline MS this morning after narcan, continue
   narcan.  Also will discontinue digoxin.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   -continue home meds dig 0.125mg qHD
   -restart 12.5 mg metoprolol as BP is stable.
   # hypoglycemia: differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypothryoidism
   or adrenal insufficiency or insulinoma versus medication error /
   surreptitious insulin use.
   -has had insulin levels in the past which have been low [**10-15**], C
   peptide was normal (elevated to 4.8 on [**10-7**]), Insulin Ab which was
   negative, insulin like growth factor-1 which was negative and IGF
   binding protein - 2 that was high.
   -Insulin and C-peptide levels pending from admission BG of 25.
   -send TSH
   -continue prednisone at bedtime, 5mg po qhs
   -w/u for leukocytosis as above, continue antibiotics
   -q2 hour fingersticks, continues to have D50 requirement (5 amps since
   arrival)
   -consider endocrinology consultation
   # PVD s/p TMA debridement: has wound vac.  Continue, possible source of
   infection.
   -Vascular consult for further management
continue current antibiotics
   -Foot X-ray pending
   # LUE edema: u/s negative on left side, right UE DVT seen, right upper
   extremity ultrasound pending. Likely HD cath related.
   FEN: NPO for now, monitor electrolytes, continue vitamins

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer. He presented with confusion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient responded to narcan (0.1 mg) for obtundation, indicating opioid overdose. He also responded to a lower dose of narcan (0.05 mg) this morning. 

The assessment and plan include treating hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient is currently receiving HD and has been treated with multiple doses of narcan for somnolence. He is also receiving haloperidol or risperidone for agitation post-narcan. The doctors are monitoring his blood glucose levels every two hours and continue to administer D50 as needed. 

The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, medication overdose, or other causes. Blood cultures, including the HD catheter culture, are pending. The patient's hypoxia requires oxygen supplementation, and his COPD should be managed with nebulizers every six hours and albuterol as needed. 

The patient has ESRD and is on maintenance HD on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. He missed a dial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been persistently sedated without any narcotics or other sedatives. The patient also has hypoglycemia that has improved with D10W. Additionally, he has renal failure and is on dialysis, as well as a DNR/I status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could potentially progress to delirium, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the prolonged stay in the ICU, increasing the risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Worsening Renal Function: The patient's renal failure may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest and limited oral intake can lead to malnutrition, which can impair wound healing and immune function.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and poor nutrition can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to infection."

","The patient has several ongoing medical conditions and potential complications based on the provided progress note. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is persistently sedated without any narcotics or other sedatives. This can be due to various causes such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying brain dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed, including a trial of narcan, checking ammonia and dig levels, and imaging studies like a head CT.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient continues to have low blood sugar levels, which has improved with the administration of D10W (dextrose 50% in water). It is important to monitor and manage blood glucose levels carefully to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

3. Renal failure (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis last Friday and has end-stage renal disease. This indicates significant kidney dysfunction, and ongoing management of renal replacement therapy will be required.

4. Potential infections: The patient had a line sepsis and received antibiotics. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

5. Respiratory support: The patient is on a face tent with supplemental oxygen and has an ABG (arterial blood gas) indicating respiratory acidosis with a PaCO2 of 65 mmHg. This suggests the need for ongoing respiratory support and monitoring.

6. Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation and low blood pressure (hypot"

He presented with confusion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient's condition has been somnolent and waxing/waning mental status. He received 100mg IV hydrocortisone for missed PO prednisone. His D10 drip was decreased to 50cc/hr. Ammonia level is 18. CXR showed no significant change. Dig level is 2.2, and dig was stopped. Solumedrol 5mg IV bid was started. ASA was changed to PR, and Plavix was not given due to no PO intake. The wife wants to take him home, and there will be a discussion about goals of care with palliative care and hospice. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency based on his symptoms and the fact that he missed two days of PO prednisone.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has imbalances in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and magnesium (Mg++).
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has obesity hypo"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transmural amputation (TMA) ulcer. The patient presented with confusion in the setting of hypoglycemia and hypotension. The patient's wife has expressed that the current care is not consistent with the patient's wishes, as discussed previously.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of low blood sugar levels, which can lead to confusion and other neurological symptoms if not promptly addressed.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced low blood pressure, which may compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient's obesity hypoventilation and suspected COPD could lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of the underlying respiratory condition.
4. Infection: The presence of coarse bilateral crepitations in the lungs suggests a possible pulmonary infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. ESRD complications: The patient's end-stage renal disease may lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload, requiring careful management of dialysis and electrolyte levels.
6. PVD complications: The patient's peripheral vascular disease increases the risk of complications such as poor wound healing and potential amputation of other extremities.
7. TMA ulcer: The patient's recent TMA ulcer may become infected or worsen, leading to additional complications.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events, such as stroke.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which can be associated with malnutrition.
10. Medication allergies: The patient has known allergies to Neupogen (filgrastim), Neurontin (gabapentin), and Dilaudid (hydromorphone HCl/PF), which need to be considered when prescribing medications.

It is important to monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being and provide appropriate care based on the goals of care discussed with the patient's wife."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, uncertain chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with confusion, hypoglycemia, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes somnolence, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may be experiencing adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by the low cortisol level and symptoms such as confusion and hypotension.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugar levels, which can lead to confusion, weakness, and even seizures if not promptly addressed.
3. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's obesity hypoventilation and uncertain COPD, there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially if the patient does not adequately ventilate.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right upper extremity DVT, and further evaluation is needed. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed.
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The presence of a dialysis catheter increases the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and poor nutrition can contribute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been persistently sedated without any narcotics or other sedatives. Infection workup is pending, and there is no clear etiology identified. The patient's wife prefers changing the management to comfort measures. The patient also has a history of hypoglycemia, which has been extensively worked up in the past. He is currently improving with D10W but cannot safely take oral glucose due to altered mental status. The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis last Friday. The family wishes to hold off on further hemodialysis, understanding the risks and potential outcome of resultant electrolyte abnormalities. The focus of care will be changed to comfort measures. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and has multiple lumen lines and a dialysis catheter in place. Prophylactic measures include boots and subcutaneous UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and elevation of the head of bed for ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) with comfort measures only, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has an altered mental status, which is not due to delirium, and an infection workup is pending. The patient also has hypoglycemia, renal failure (ESRD), and is on dialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and infection workup suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistent hypoglycemia needs close monitoring and management. If not properly controlled, it can result in severe brain damage or even death.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) indicates a chronic kidney condition. This can lead to various complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.

4. Dialysis complications: As the patient is on dialysis, there is a risk of complications related to the procedure itself, such as infection at the catheter site, bleeding, or hypotension during the treatment.

5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can be difficult to treat and may lead to further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a chief complaint of being uncomfortable and confused. She has allergies to Neupogen, Neurontin, and Dilaudid. The patient is currently on morphine sulfate infusion and other ICU medications. She is also receiving inpatient hospice care and is expected to continue until her family arrives. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/37 to 138/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on dialysis and has multiple lines inserted. Her blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and potassium, as well as low levels of hemoglobin and platelets. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI/CMO.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) but still shows signs of elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Renal impairment: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction or damage.
3. Hyperglycemia: The high glucose level indicates poor glycemic control, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Electrolyte"
