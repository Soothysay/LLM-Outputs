   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, tumor lysis, and acute hypotension. They have been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure of 86/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They have a fever of 101.5Â°F and show signs of severe acidosis.

The patient's medical history is significant for suspected underlying COPD, and their current condition suggests possible sepsis or hypovolemia. They also have acute kidney injury (ARF) with poor urine output, and it is likely pre-renal in nature. The patient is suspected to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and requires urgent oncological intervention.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 266 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 240. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, while renal function tests reveal elevated creatinine and BUN levels. Lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are also elevated.

   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with ongoing VAC support,
   may need to increase PEEP and RR for ongoing respiratory distress.
   Cause unclear, suspect some component may be infectious or related to
   tachycardia induced cardiogenic edema, but the CT is most concerning
   for infiltrating malignancy. Will continue vanco / CTX / cipro, and
   will hydrate for now while following up echo. Will need BMBx to r/o

   also consider fat pad bx for possible amyloidosis, though it wouldn't
   explain everything. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a likely new diagnosis of acromegaly, persistent tachycardia, and tumor lysis. He developed worsening respiratory distress despite lasix and failed non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), leading to intubation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.5Â°C (103.1Â°F), a heart rate of 106 bpm, a blood pressure of 104/47 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9-13 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation of 81%, and a fluid balance of 4,153 mL in and 2,750 mL out.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 266 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 5.4 mmol/L, elevated troponin-T level of 0.02, and significantly elevated lactic acid level of 3.0 mmol/L. Imaging findings suggest a possible malignant process in the spine, lymphoma, testicular cancer, and granulomatous disease.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse bilateral rales, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and the use of accessory muscles. Neurological examination is limited due to acute respiratory distress, but there is a right facial droop.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to profound dysynchrony, suspected underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the need for passive ventilation support. Hypotension is suspected to be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or acidosis, and the patient will be treated with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Acute renal failure is also noted, with poor urine output, and the patient is receiving intravenous fluids and diuretics. Oncological considerations include a possible diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or other malignancy, and the need for consultation with oncology. Tumor lysis syndrome is being treated with rasburicase and hydration. Tachycardia may be related to high-output heart failure from acromegaly, and further evaluation is needed. Other findings include bilateral leg weakness, tender scrotal swelling due to epididymitis and orchitis, and joint pain related to acromegaly or infiltrative bone process.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, tumor lysis syndrome, and cardiac complications related to acromegaly and tachycardia."

   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with ongoing VAC support,
   may need to increase PEEP and RR for ongoing respiratory distress.
   Cause unclear, suspect some component may be infectious or related to
   tachycardia induced cardiogenic edema, but the CT is most concerning
   for infiltrating malignancy. Will continue vanco / CTX / cipro, and
   will hydrate for now while following up echo. Will need BMBx to r/o

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a likely new diagnosis of acromegaly, persistent tachycardia, and tumor lysis syndrome. He developed worsening respiratory distress despite Lasix and failed non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), leading to intubation. The patient has been sedated with fentanyl, versed, and propofol. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.5Â°C, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96% on supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals an alert and oriented patient with sclera anicteric, normal oropharynx, supple neck, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), no leg edema or lower limb pain, diffuse bilateral rales in the lungs, and no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows right facial droop.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.2 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 266 thousand/mm3,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a likely new diagnosis of acromegaly, persistent tachycardia, and tumor lysis syndrome. He developed worsening respiratory distress despite Lasix and failed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). The patient was intubated in the setting of intravenous fluid (IVF) administration and remains intubated on 8 mg/hour versed, 200 mcg/hour fentanyl, and 50 mcg/hour propofol. Pressors include levo at 0.03 and neo at 1.5. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 9-13, urine output per hour (UOP) is 150-250 ml/hr, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 81%. The patient is on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and rasburicase. Extensive family meetings were held, and the healthcare power of attorney (HCP) is [**Name (NI) 1068**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient developed worsening respiratory distress and required intubation. The etiology is believed to be pulmonary edema, with concerns for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy causing an inability to tolerate fluid challenge. There is also evolving left lower lobe pneumonia (LLPNA) in the context of chemotherapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-inch-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's condition remains unchanged from admission, except for the recent development of fever, hypotension, renal failure, and tachycardia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, receiving phenylephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature of 39.5 degrees Celsius, tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 104/47 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's blood gas analysis indicates a slightly low pH level of 7.34, elevated PaCO2 level of 51 mmHg, and normal oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 102 to 188 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 3.0 mmol/L, and elevated levels of creatinine, troponin T, and lactic acid. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and decreased urine output of 2,150 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis suggests respiratory acidosis with compensation. The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, and need for mechanical ventilation indicate the development of ARDS.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine level, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level suggest renal dysfunction, which may progress to AKI.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and low albumin level may indicate hepatic dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's consistently elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which may lead to hyperglycemia-related complications.

The patient remains intubated and on sedation and analgesia. Pressors are weaned down, CV (central venous) pressure is within normal range, and urine output is stable. The patient is on appropriate antibiotics and has been started on rasburicase as per oncology. There was an extensive family meeting involving HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has profound dysnchronry and a suspected underlying COPD. They must become passive on the ventilator, and if needed, paralysis will be added. Nebulizers and steroids will be added to the treatment plan.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or acidosis. The treatment plan includes fluid resuscitation with d5w, targeting a CVP of 12, checking SCVO2, and administering empirical antibiotics to correct acidosis.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has poor urine output, and a bladder scan is negative. IVF and trend but shock and dense pre-renal azotemia are likely. Monitoring potassium levels and dosing medications accordingly are recommended.
4. Oncology: Preliminary findings suggest a possible diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Collaboration with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 2803**]"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has profound dysynchrony suspecting underlying COPD. They improved once they became passive on the ventilator and are being considered for weaning to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. The need to wean sedation.

2. Fevers: The patient is experiencing fevers, and it is unclear whether they are due to B symptoms or an infectious cause. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, Cipro) have been started.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, and there is a concern for possible shock due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or acidosis. The patient is improving and off Levophed (a vasopressor), with plans to wean Neo (another vasopressor). The central venous pressure (CVP) is being monitored at 10-12 mmHg, and urine output is being watched.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has signs of acute renal failure but is improving after sedation. Further evaluation and management are needed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing profound dysynchrony while on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to carefully wean sedation as the patient attempts to transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

2. Fever: The patient is experiencing fevers, which could be due to B symptoms or an infectious cause. Empiric antibiotics have been started, including Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Cipro.

3. Hypotension: The patient has shown signs of hypotension, potentially indicating shock. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, or acidosis. The patient is being weaned off Levophed and Neo, and the CVP is being monitored.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is improving after resuscitation. Renal dosing of medications will be done accordingly, and hemodialysis (HD) may be required.

5. Oncological issues: The patient may have preliminary findings suggestive of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Further evaluation and treatment planning are needed in collaboration with oncologists.

6. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient is at risk for tumor lysis syndrome, and measures such as rasburicase"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Resp Failure: profound dysynchrony with underlying COPD, improved
   once he could become passive on the vent. Will try to wean to PSV
   today. Need to wean sedation carefully as we do this.
   2. Fevers: B symptoms versus infectious, pan cultured Empiric ABX
   Vanco, ceftriaxone, Cipro
   3. Hypotension: DDX shock due to sepsis or hypovolemia or acidosis.
   Improving and off Levophed, weaning Neo
 CVP 10-12. Watch UOP
   4. ARF: improving after resuscitation. Renal following no acute
   iundicatin for HD, renally dose all meds.
   5. Onc: prelim maybe ALL/AML- await final path. Will work with Drs
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2803**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 6993**]. Start with dexamethasone and may need Onc RN to
   come from East for urgent Rx.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to profound dysynchrony with underlying COPD. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient also has fevers, hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and possible oncological issues such as ALL/AML. The patient is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and others.

There are concerns about tumor lysis syndrome and the need for rasburicase treatment. The patient also has a condition called acromegaly, which requires further workup.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are being implemented.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has profound dysynchrony with underlying COPD and requires ventilatory support. Weaning off sedation and mechanical ventilation should be done carefully.

2. Fevers: The patient is experiencing fevers, which could be due to infection or non-infectious causes. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, including Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ciprofloxacin.

3. Hypotension: The patient has shown signs of hypotension, possibly due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or acidosis. The patient is improving and off Levophed, with Neo being weaned off as well. Continuous monitoring of the central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output (UOP) is recommended.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is improving after resuscitation. Renal replacement therapy (such as hemodialysis) may be required, and all medications should be dosed according to renal function.

5. Oncologic Condition: The patient's preliminary diagnosis suggests a possible hematologic malignancy such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Further evaluation and consultation with oncologists are needed. Urgent chemotherapy may be required, and an oncology"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial, suspect pneumonia LLL (possible
   aspiration), diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic
   engorgement, and possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse history,
   enlarged lung fields).   Improved on mechanical ventilation.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue antimicrobials.
   FEVERS
 persistent, possible underlying systemic process (such as
   symptoms from maligancy) or infection (ex. Pneumonia).  Unrevealing
   imaging.  Cultures pending.  Monitor fevers, use coolig blanket.
   Continue empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxicin)
   HYPOTENSION
 concern for sepsis and component of hypovolemia.  No
   evidence for adrenal insufficiency.  Improved, and now off
   vasopressors.   Maintain = CVP 10-12 cm H2O.
   FLUIDS
 need to further assess intravascular status.  [**Month (only) 11**] require iv
   fluid bolus to maintain.  Follow CVP= 10-12 cm H2O.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Improving following resuscitation.  Attributed
   to ATN, possible tumor lysis syndrome, bilateral obstruction, drug
   effect.  Renal dose all medications.
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
  unclear etiology.  Continue Rasburicase,
   Allopurinol.  Trend electrolytes q4-6 hrs.  Oncology preliminary
   impression favors ALL/AML
 bone marrow results pending.  Continue
   dexamethasone.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with acromegaly, persistent tachycardia, and evidence of tumor lysis syndrome. He was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure and is now transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU for initiation of chemotherapy. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38Â°C (100.4Â°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 146/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. The patient has an endotracheal tube in place, and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, the patient is sedated but responds to tactile stimuli.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.2 thousand/mm3, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 266 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte im"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They have a history of profound dysynchrony with underlying COPD and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient is sedated and unable to provide their own medical history. They have received multiple doses of antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. Vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/45 mmHg to 146/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has been monitored for fluid balance, hemodynamics, and blood products. They have an arterial line and are receiving medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis and venous thromboembolism prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, they are at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and atelectasis.
2. Infection: The patient has fevers and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. They are also at risk for hospital-acquired infections due to their prolonged ICU stay.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and will require careful monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Intubated, on vent on AC mode. Consider decreasing FI02 this morning.
   -Continue sedation with fentanyl/midazolam.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca Q8H)
   -hold allopurinol in setting of ARF
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -single dose rasbiricase already given
   - Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -tests to order include free IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this),
   IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load,
   pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP.
   -Cipro started for [**10-28**] day course on [**7-11**] in case of STI. Consider
   d/cing.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40-year-old male with new diagnosis of acromegaly, Bell's Palsy,
   persistent tachycardia, tumor lysis presentation who is s/p BMB with
   suspected lymphoma vs. leukemia.
   ALL vs. Burkitts developed respiratory distress in the setting of IVF
   administration.
   # Respiratory Failure- Patient had respiratory distress likely
   secondary to a combination of factors which include worsening pulmonary
   edema from aggressive IVFs, infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process
   diffusely in lungs and noted LLL PNA on CTA from [**2144-7-12**]. Had been on
   ceftriaxone/azithro on floor, now on CTX/Vanco & Ciprofloxacin. Now on
   AC mode on vent (TV 600, PEEP 8, RR 22, FiO2 60%, sats 98-100%). Last
   CXR with question of ETT being a bit too high (>6cm)
   -- repeat CXR
   -- repeat ABG
   -- continue to sedate w/ fentyl/versed, continue current AC mode on
   above settings
   -- continue ABX coverage with ceftriaxone/cipro/vanco therapy
   -- f/up pending blood and sputum cultures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia on telemetry and EKG. Persistent
   despite significant volume resuscitation. TSH was WNL. TTE was largely
   WNL and no evidence of CMY or heart failure. Cardiology was consulted
   and recommended Metoprolol TID but patient had this held after serious
   bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]. Prior cardiac
   enzymes not concerning for MI, CK MB and CK negative and slight
   troponin elevation likely from ARF.
   --f/up latest Cardiology recs
   --hold BB for now
   --repeat EKG
   --continue telemetry
   - treat underlying infectious process as above
   - pain control w/ fentanyl gtt
   # Malignancy/Tumor lysis syndrome: Significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia since admission but all
   improving slowly with IVFs and s/p rasbiricase therapy. Holding off on
   additional allopurinol while ARF recovers. CT c/w lymphangitic spread
   of diffuse malignant process and patient also with concerning
   thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom of thoracic
   spine per MRI. Final BM biopsy results all pending and Heme/Onc
   actively following. Granulomatous disease still in the differential but
   very unlikely given clearer picture now that favors underlying lymphoma
   vs. leukemia. Preliminary views on BM biopsy challenging in setting of
   steroid artifact.
   - will continue q8hours lysis labs
   - follow-up Heme/Onc recommendations
   - d/w Heme/Onc plans for chemotherapy
   - now s/p rasbiricase therapy
   - sending off EBV studies given possibility of Burkitts in differential
   - follow-up final bone marrow bx results
   - f/up SPEP results
   # Bilateral LE weakness:  MRI T-spine done and showed no overt
   compressions, but diffuse nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and
   epidural signal changes at T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall
   infiltrative process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA,
   MRI concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy).
   --questionable T-spine mass; d/w NSG
   --consider repeat evaluation with MRI including the lumbar spine, when
   the patient is cooperative to get full sagital and axial post-contrast
   sequences for better assessment
   --follow-up neurosurg recs
   # Acromegaly / Pituitary Macroadenoma: Per OSH records, he had an
   MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma
   which had some invasion of left cavernous sinus. No prior notes of
   complaints of vision changes and patient sedated so exam now limited.
   Endocrinology consult called and patient has had normal TSH, low
   testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol levels. Prolactin is
   normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was 188.
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   # Urinary retention  - [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to enlarged prostate from
   acromegaly.  Not clearly related to spinal mass or cord compression per
   recent MRI thoracic spine but would be helpful to get lumbar films in
   future. Also note of some Unable to get good exam on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] as
   he is sedated. Urotherial thickening noted and may also be contributing
   to his trouble with urination.
   -keep foley in place
   -slow IVFs
   -closely monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hour
   #ARF: baseline Cr went from 0.6--> 1.5 range, now resolving. Renal
   consult called and following. Recent ARF attributed to ATN from
   oliguria and very high uric acid levels to 12 range. BUN/Cr now
   trending down.
   - monitoring BUN/Cr trend, down from 1.5 to 1.1 today
   - continue IVFs slowly
   - renally dose meds, avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxins
   - hold allopurinol for now, d/w Heme/Onc restart
   # Tender scrotal swelling. Epididymitis and orchitis are main
   differential based on scrotal US. No clear masses. G&C swab was
   negative. [**Month (only) 11**] also be a presentation related to infiltrative malignancy
   along with his general anasarca all over on imaging of CT chest/Abd and
   clinical exam findings with bilateral LE edema.
   -continue to monitor and cover with cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for 10-14 days from
   day #1 [**7-11**]
   # Bell's Palsy: Acromegaly has been associated with nerve palsies and
   this may be related. Otherwise, differential includes viral etiology as
   well. Neuro exam now limited as he is sedated.
   - continue with acyclovir, continue steroids
   # Diffuse arthralgias: Most likely secondary to both acromegalic
   osseous changes and an underlying infiltrative process.
   - avoiding NSAIDs
   - once awake tylenol, for now pain control w/ fentnyl
   #Hypernatremia: Improved now from 150 to 145.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a new diagnosis of acromegaly, Bell's Palsy, persistent tachycardia, and tumor lysis presentation. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy with suspected lymphoma vs. leukemia. The patient developed respiratory distress in the setting of intravenous fluid administration and was placed on assisted mechanical ventilation (AC mode) with a tidal volume of 600 mL, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 60%. He also has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention secondary to an enlarged prostate from acromegaly.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory distress likely secondary to a combination of factors including worsening pulmonary edema from aggressive IVFs, infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process, and noted left lower lobe pneumonia on CT angiography. The patient is currently on assisted mechanical ventilation with the settings mentioned above. Repeat chest X-ray and ABG are recommended. Continue sedation with fentanyl andversed, and continue current AC mode on the mentioned settings. Continue antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone/cipro/vanco therapy, and follow up with blood and sputum cultures.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent sinus tachycardia on telemetry and EKG, despite significant volume resuscitation. TSH was within normal limits"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Advance ETT 1cm more because cuff appears to be above thoracic inlet
   -Switched from AC mode to pressure support [**5-19**] and well tolerated this
   morning. Given that and ABG as well as patient being more alert on
   increased sedation, work toward weaning the vent today.
   -sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, continue until ready to wean vent.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs if they still would like to follow the patient
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q8H
   -start allopurinol given normalized Cr
   -repeat dose of rasbiracase 6mg x 1
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   -guaiac stools (Hct trending down since admission)
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u endocrine recs  (do they still want the following labs: free
   IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this), IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT
   with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load, pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -When stabilized, consider repeat Ca and PTH drawn at same time (PTH
   was normal in setting of high Ca)
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -d/c cipro
   -continue vanc and CTX for hospital-acquired PNA
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP given recent h/o retention.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Advance ETT 1cm more because cuff appears to be above thoracic inlet
   -Switched from AC mode to pressure support [**5-19**] and well tolerated this
   morning. Given that and ABG as well as patient being more alert on
   increased sedation, work toward weaning the vent today.
   -sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, continue until ready to wean vent.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs if they still would like to follow the patient
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q8H
   -start allopurinol given normalized Cr
   -repeat dose of rasbiracase 6mg x 1
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   -guaiac stools (Hct trending down since admission)
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u endocrine recs  (do they still want the following labs: free
   IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this), IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT
   with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load, pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -When stabilized, consider repeat Ca and PTH drawn at same time (PTH
   was normal in setting of high Ca)
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -d/c cipro
   -continue vanc and CTX for hospital-acquired PNA
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP given recent h/o retention.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Intubated, on vent on AC mode. Consider decreasing FI02 this morning.
   -Continue sedation with fentanyl/midazolam.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca Q8H)
   -hold allopurinol in setting of ARF
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -single dose rasbiricase already given
   - Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -tests to order include free IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this),
   IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load,
   pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP.
   -Cipro started for [**10-28**] day course on [**7-11**] in case of STI. Consider
   d/cing.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a complex medical history, including tumor lysis syndrome, suspected acromegaly, and possible lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. The patient has a history of COPD and significant smoking history. He presented with Bell's palsy and urinary retention initially. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, respiratory/lactic acidosis, and potential infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with AC mode. FiO2 should be decreased, and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam should be continued. Antibiotics for PNA (CTX + Cipro) should be continued, and a repeat CXR for ETT placement should be done. ABG should be repeated after changing vent settings.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient had persistent tachycardia despite significant volume resuscitation. TSH is normal, and TTE showed normal EF without evidence of heart failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but was discontinued due to serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing. Cardiac enzymes are not concerning for MI, with slight elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF. EKGs should be followed, and cardiology recommendations should be followed. Beta-blockers should be avoided, and CVP should be monitored with fluids to a goal"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Intubated, on vent on AC mode. Consider decreasing FI02 this morning.
   -Continue sedation with fentanyl/midazolam.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca Q8H)
   -hold allopurinol in setting of ARF
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration

   # Bilateral LE weakness:  MRI T-spine done and showed no overt
   compressions, but diffuse nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and
   epidural signal changes at T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall
   infiltrative process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA,
   MRI concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy).
   --questionable T-spine mass; d/w NSG
   --consider repeat evaluation with MRI including the lumbar spine, when
   the patient is cooperative to get full sagital and axial post-contrast
   sequences for better assessment
   --follow-up neurosurg recs
   # Acromegaly / Pituitary Macroadenoma: Per OSH records, he had an
   MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma
   which had some invasion of left cavernous sinus. No prior notes of
   complaints of vision changes and patient sedated so exam now limited.
   Endocrinology consult called and patient has had normal TSH, low
   testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol levels. Prolactin is
   normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was 188.
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   # Urinary retention  - [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to enlarged prostate from
   acromegaly.  Not clearly related to spinal mass or cord compression per
   recent MRI thoracic spine but would be helpful to get lumbar films in
   future. Also note of some Unable to get good exam on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] as
   he is sedated. Urotherial thickening noted and may also be contributing
   to his trouble with urination.
   -keep foley in place
   -slow IVFs
   -closely monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hour
   #ARF: baseline Cr went from 0.6--> 1.5 range, now resolving. Renal
   consult called and following. Recent ARF attributed to ATN from
   oliguria and very high uric acid levels to 12 range. BUN/Cr now
   trending down.
   - monitoring BUN/Cr trend, down from 1.5 to 1.1 today
   - continue IVFs slowly
   - renally dose meds, avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxins
   - hold allopurinol for now, d/w Heme/Onc restart
   # Tender scrotal swelling. Epididymitis and orchitis are main
   differential based on scrotal US. No clear masses. G&C swab was
   negative. [**Month (only) 11**] also be a presentation related to infiltrative malignancy
   along with his general anasarca all over on imaging of CT chest/Abd and
   clinical exam findings with bilateral LE edema.
   -continue to monitor and cover with cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for 10-14 days from
   day #1 [**7-11**]
   # Bell's Palsy: Acromegaly has been associated with nerve palsies and
   this may be related. Otherwise, differential includes viral etiology as
   well. Neuro exam now limited as he is sedated.
   - continue with acyclovir, continue steroids
   # Diffuse arthralgias: Most likely secondary to both acromegalic
   osseous changes and an underlying infiltrative process.
   - avoiding NSAIDs
   - once awake tylenol, for now pain control w/ fentnyl
   #Hypernatremia: Improved now from 150 to 145.
   --Trending Na, continue D5W as needed

   Assessment and Plan
   40-year-old male with new diagnosis of acromegaly, Bell's Palsy,
   persistent tachycardia, tumor lysis presentation who is s/p BMB with
   suspected lymphoma vs. leukemia.
   ALL vs. Burkitts developed respiratory distress in the setting of IVF
   administration.
   # Respiratory Failure- Patient had respiratory distress likely
   secondary to a combination of factors which include worsening pulmonary
   edema from aggressive IVFs, infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process
   diffusely in lungs and noted LLL PNA on CTA from [**2144-7-12**]. Had been on
   ceftriaxone/azithro on floor, now on CTX/Vanco & Ciprofloxacin. Now on
   AC mode on vent (TV 600, PEEP 8, RR 22, FiO2 60%, sats 98-100%). Last
   CXR with question of ETT being a bit too high (>6cm)
   -- repeat CXR
   -- repeat ABG
   -- continue to sedate w/ fentyl/versed, continue current AC mode on
   above settings
   -- continue ABX coverage with ceftriaxone/cipro/vanco therapy
   -- f/up pending blood and sputum cultures
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia on telemetry and EKG. Persistent
   despite significant volume resuscitation. TSH was WNL. TTE was largely
   WNL and no evidence of CMY or heart failure. Cardiology was consulted
   and recommended Metoprolol TID but patient had this held after serious
   bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]. Prior cardiac
   enzymes not concerning for MI, CK MB and CK negative and slight
   troponin elevation likely from ARF.
   --f/up latest Cardiology recs
   --hold BB for now
   --repeat EKG
   --continue telemetry
   - treat underlying infectious process as above
   - pain control w/ fentanyl gtt
   # Malignancy/Tumor lysis syndrome: Significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia since admission but all
   improving slowly with IVFs and s/p rasbiricase therapy. Holding off on
   additional allopurinol while ARF recovers. CT c/w lymphangitic spread
   of diffuse malignant process and patient also with concerning
   thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom of thoracic
   spine per MRI. Final BM biopsy results all pending and Heme/Onc
   actively following. Granulomatous disease still in the differential but
   very unlikely given clearer picture now that favors underlying lymphoma
   vs. leukemia. Preliminary views on BM biopsy challenging in setting of
   steroid artifact.
   - will continue q8hours lysis labs
   - follow-up Heme/Onc recommendations
   - d/w Heme/Onc plans for chemotherapy
   - now s/p rasbiricase therapy
   - sending off EBV studies given possibility of Burkitts in differential
   - follow-up final bone marrow bx results
   - f/up SPEP results
   # Bilateral LE weakness:  MRI T-spine done and showed no overt
   compressions, but diffuse nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and
   epidural signal changes at T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall
   infiltrative process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA,
   MRI concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy).
   --questionable T-spine mass; d/w NSG
   --consider repeat evaluation with MRI including the lumbar spine, when
   the patient is cooperative to get full sagital and axial post-contrast
   sequences for better assessment
   --follow-up neurosurg recs
   # Acromegaly / Pituitary Macroadenoma: Per OSH records, he had an
   MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma
   which had some invasion of left cavernous sinus. No prior notes of
   complaints of vision changes and patient sedated so exam now limited.
   Endocrinology consult called and patient has had normal TSH, low
   testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol levels. Prolactin is
   normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was 188.
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u endocrine recs
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   # Urinary retention  - [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to enlarged prostate from
   acromegaly.  Not clearly related to spinal mass or cord compression per
   recent MRI thoracic spine but would be helpful to get lumbar films in
   future. Also note of some Unable to get good exam on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] as
   he is sedated. Urotherial thickening noted and may also be contributing
   to his trouble with urination.
   -keep foley in place
   -slow IVFs
   -closely monitor UOP, goal >30cc/hour
   #ARF: baseline Cr went from 0.6--> 1.5 range, now resolving. Renal
   consult called and following. Recent ARF attributed to ATN from
   oliguria and very high uric acid levels to 12 range. BUN/Cr now
   trending down.
   - monitoring BUN/Cr trend, down from 1.5 to 1.1 today
   - continue IVFs slowly
   - renally dose meds, avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxins
   - hold allopurinol for now, d/w Heme/Onc restart
   # Tender scrotal swelling. Epididymitis and orchitis are main
   differential based on scrotal US. No clear masses. G&C swab was
   negative. [**Month (only) 11**] also be a presentation related to infiltrative malignancy
   along with his general anasarca all over on imaging of CT chest/Abd and
   clinical exam findings with bilateral LE edema.
   -continue to monitor and cover with cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for 10-14 days from
   day #1 [**7-11**]
   # Bell's Palsy: Acromegaly has been associated with nerve palsies and
   this may be related. Otherwise, differential includes viral etiology as
   well. Neuro exam now limited as he is sedated.
   - continue with acyclovir, continue steroids
   # Diffuse arthralgias: Most likely secondary to both acromegalic
   osseous changes and an underlying infiltrative process.
   - avoiding NSAIDs
   - once awake tylenol, for now pain control w/ fentnyl
   #Hypernatremia: Improved now from 150 to 145.

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Switched from AC mode to pressure support [**5-19**] and well tolerated this
   morning. Given that and ABG as well as patient being more alert on
   increased sedation, work toward weaning the vent today.
   -sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, continue until ready to wean vent.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs if they still would like to follow the patient
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q8H
   -start allopurinol given normalized Cr
   -repeat dose of rasbiracase 6mg x 1
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   -guaiac stools (Hct trending down since admission)
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u endocrine recs  (do they still want the following labs: free
   IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this), IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT
   with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load, pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -When stabilized, consider repeat Ca and PTH drawn at same time (PTH
   was normal in setting of high Ca)
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -d/c cipro
   -continue vanc and CTX for hospital-acquired PNA
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP given recent h/o retention.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Advance ETT 1cm more because cuff appears to be above thoracic inlet
   -Switched from AC mode to pressure support [**5-19**] and well tolerated this
   morning. Given that and ABG as well as patient being more alert on
   increased sedation, work toward weaning the vent today.
   -sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, continue until ready to wean vent.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs if they still would like to follow the patient
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q8H
   -start allopurinol given normalized Cr
   -repeat dose of rasbiracase 6mg x 1
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   -guaiac stools (Hct trending down since admission)
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u endocrine recs  (do they still want the following labs: free
   IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this), IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT
   with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load, pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -When stabilized, consider repeat Ca and PTH drawn at same time (PTH
   was normal in setting of high Ca)
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -d/c cipro
   -continue vanc and CTX for hospital-acquired PNA
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP given recent h/o retention.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a chief complaint of tumor lysis syndrome. He is being worked up for new diagnoses of acromegaly and possible lymphoma. The patient is currently in the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress, leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia. He also has pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. The patient's presentation includes Bell's Palsy and urinary retention.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory: The patient's respiratory distress on [07/13] was attributed to his respiratory/lactic acidosis with left lower lobe pneumonia, possible infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation. The ETT was advanced 1cm more because the cuff appears to be above the thoracic inlet. The patient was switched from assist-control mode to pressure support and tolerated it well this morning. The ABG and patient's increased alertness on increased sedation suggest that weaning off the ventilator today is appropriate.
- Sedation with fentanyl/midazolam will continue until ready to wean vent.
- Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro.
- Repeat CXR for ETT placement.
- Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
- Follow up blood and sputum cultures.

2. Cardiovascular: The patient has persistent tachycardia in the 120s for the first"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient responds appropriately to questions although remains sedated. Allergies are not reported. The patient has received antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.

The patient's review of systems is generally unremarkable except for the respiratory system, where there are signs of a possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse history, enlarged lung fields) and pneumonia (fever, diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement).

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.3Â°C (100.9Â°F), which indicates a fever. Blood pressure is within normal limits, heart rate is slightly elevated, respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is 98% on mechanical ventilation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 148 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure: Multifactorial, suspect pneumonia LLL (possible aspiration), diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying COPD. Improved on mechanical ventilation. Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The note mentions several potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a suspected pneumonia in the left lower lobe (LLL), possibly due to aspiration. The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including this underlying infection.

2. Underlying COPD: The patient has a history of tobacco abuse, enlarged lung fields, and diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement. These findings suggest the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

3. Systemic process or infection: The patient has persistent fevers, which could indicate an underlying systemic process such as malignancy or infection like pneumonia. Unrevealing imaging and pending cultures suggest that the cause of the fever is not yet identified.

4. Sepsis and hypovolemia: The patient initially had hypotension, which was a concern for sepsis and component of hypovolemia. However, the patient improved and was taken off vasopressors. It is important to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12 cm H2O.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possible tumor lysis syndrome, bilateral obstruction, or drug effect. The renal function is improving following resuscitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Extubated and reintubated yesterday due to tachypnea and
   increased difficulty breathing. Being treated for LLL PNA, suspicion
   for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Repeat CXR this afternoon
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Get ABG if change in respiratory status or if change ventilator
   settings
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -EKG
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, flow
   cytometry of peripheral blood now pending with high suspiction for an
   acute lymphoma. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process,  thickening in stomach, ureters.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q12H
   -continue allopurinol
   -EBV antibodies pending; consider sending PCR if suspicion is high
   given his hypogammaglobulinemia on SPEP
   -continue hydration
   -f/u stool guaiac
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain intial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, and free IGF-1 level requested by endocrine was not
   possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and PTH were both normal, eliminating
   suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine consult
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.  Neurosurgery following. Patient already on
   dexamethasone for malignancy treatment.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   as well as repeat imaging of pituitary macroadenoma (surgery likely the
   definitive treatment)
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue [**Month/Year (2) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 4 vancomycin, Day 3 CTX.
   -urine cx negative; sputum and blood cx pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP given recent h/o retention.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 40-year-old male with a chief complaint of tumor lysis syndrome.
- He is being worked up for acromegaly and possible lymphoma.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress and was intubated.
- He had an episode of hypotensive bradycardia and is currently on invasive ventilation.
- The patient was extubated and then reintubated due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing.
- Tumor lysis labs have improved, and the patient has received doses of rasburicase and is now on allopurinol.
- A peripheral blood sample for flow cytometry has been sent because the bone marrow biopsy was inadequate for results.
- The patient has a history of Bell's Palsy and urinary retention.
- He has been treated for left lower lobe pneumonia and there is suspicion of infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.
- The patient's cardiovascular system is tachycardic, but TSH is within normal limits and a TTE showed normal ejection fraction and no evidence of heart failure.
- The patient's heme-onc labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. These labs have trended down and are now normal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a chief complaint of tumor lysis syndrome. He is being worked up for acromegaly and possible lymphoma. The patient is currently in the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress, leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia. He also has pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis.

24-hour events:
- The patient was extubated at 4 pm but had to be reintubated at 11 pm due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing.
- Tumor lysis labs improved, and the patient received another dose of rasburicase, then transitioned to allopurinol as per hematology/oncology recommendations.
- A peripheral blood sample for flow cytometry was requested because necrosis of the bone marrow rendered the biopsy inadequate for results.

Assessment and Plan:
- The patient has tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in the ICU after respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis.
- Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitt's.
- Respiratory: The patient has respiratory distress attributed to his respiratory/lactic acidosis with left lower lobe pneumonia, possible infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of aggressive fluid resusc"

Cardiology recommended metoprolol, but it was discontinued after an episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing. Cardiac enzymes are not concerning for myocardial infarction, with a slight elevation in troponin likely secondary to acute kidney injury.

The patient's hematologic/oncologic condition includes significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia. These laboratory values are trending down with intravenous fluids and a single dose of rasburicase. A CT scan showed lymphangitic spread of"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Extubated and reintubated yesterday due to tachypnea and
   increased difficulty breathing. Being treated for LLL PNA, suspicion
   for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Repeat CXR this afternoon
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Get ABG if change in respiratory status or if change ventilator
   settings
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -EKG
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, flow
   cytometry of peripheral blood now pending with high suspiction for an
   acute lymphoma. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process,  thickening in stomach, ureters.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q12H
   -continue allopurinol
   -EBV antibodies pending; consider sending PCR if suspicion is high
   given his hypogammaglobulinemia on SPEP
   -continue hydration
   -f/u stool guaiac
   -Today is Day 4 of dexamethasone. Tomorrow decrease dose by half.
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain intial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine consult
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.  Neurosurgery following. Patient already on
   dexamethasone for malignancy treatment.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary. Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although
   in light of recent ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until
   patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue [**Month/Year (2) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 4 vancomycin, Day 3 CTX.
   -urine cx negative; sputum and blood cx pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV antibodies pending
   -Legionella negative
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP.
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-inch-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of tachypnea and increased work of breathing. They were intubated due to tachypnea but extubated today. The patient has TLS and requires allopurinol as per heme-onc recommendations. The patient's HIV status needs to be checked once they can consent, and peripheral blood for flow cytometry should be resent. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on 07/14/2144 at 11:32 PM.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient required reintubation due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure.
2. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Prophylaxis for DVT has been initiated, indicating a risk of developing blood clots in the veins.
3. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis, suggesting a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers due to critical illness.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated on multiple occasions, indicating poor glycemic control.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium, sodium,"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Respiratory distress on [**7-13**] attributed to his
   respiratory/lactic acidosis with LLL PNA, possible infiltrative
   lymphangitic malignant process in both lungs, in the setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patient also has a question of a
   history of COPD with significant smoking history (50+ pack years)
   -Advance ETT 1cm more because cuff appears to be above thoracic inlet
   -Switched from AC mode to pressure support [**5-19**] and well tolerated this
   morning. Given that and ABG as well as patient being more alert on
   increased sedation, work toward weaning the vent today.
   -sedation with fentanyl/midazolam, continue until ready to wean vent.
   -Continue antibiotics for PNA: CTX + Cipro
   -Repeat CXR for ETT placement
   -Repeat ABG today after changing vent settings.
   -f/u blood and sputum cx
   Cardiovascular: Persistent tachycardia to 120s for first couple days of
   admission on telemetry and EKG despite significant volume
   resuscitation. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF and no evidence of heart
   failure. Cardiology recommended metoprolol but this was d/c
ed after an
   episode of serious bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing on [**7-13**]
   as well as pressors. Cardiac enzymes not concerning for MI, slight
   elevation in troponin likely secondary to ARF.
   -Follow EKGs
   -Follow cardiology recs if they still would like to follow the patient
   -Avoid beta-blockers
   -Monitor CVP with fluids to a goal of [**10-26**] to protect his kidneys.
   -If becomes hypotensive and tachycardic, first choice pressor would be
   phenylephrine.
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia. All
   trending down with IVF and single dose of rasbiricase. CT c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process and patient also with
   concerning thickening in stomach, ureters, and possible mass at bottom
   of thoracic spine per MRI.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs (bone marrow biopsy pending, current thinking is ALL
   versus Burkitt
s. challenging review in setting of steroid
   administration) and discuss chemotherapy plans
   -trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) Q8H
   -start allopurinol given normalized Cr
   -repeat dose of rasbiracase 6mg x 1
   -EBV results
   -SPEP results
   -continue hydration
   -guaiac stools (Hct trending down since admission)
   Renal/FEN: Creatinine went from 0.6 at admission to max of 1.6,
   currently 0.8. ARF was attributed to ATN in the setting of high uric
   acid levels to 12 range.  Patient
s initial presentation was also
   urinary retention. U/S at OSH was reportedly normal. CT shows
   urothelial thickening and prostate may also be enlarged in the setting
   of acromegaly.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds until Cr stabilized
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed.
   Endocrine: Per OSH records, he had an MRI/MRA head [**7-11**] which revealed
   a 19 x30x 15mm pituitary macroadenoma which had some invasion of left
   cavernous sinus. Acromegaly suspected and could help explain appearance
   and intial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and
   urinary retention. Endocrinology consult called and patient has had
   normal TSH, low testosterone, LH elevated, slightly high cortisol
   levels. Prolactin is normal. PTH is normal. High [**Hospital1 **] at 11.2 and IGF was
   188.
   - f/u endocrine recs  (do they still want the following labs: free
   IGF-1(lab can instruct how to do this), IGFBP, repeat [**Hospital1 **], possible OGTT
   with [**Hospital1 **] levels 2hrs post 75g load, pituitary MRI, Vit D labs, UPEP
   - call for full opthalmology consult once alert and awake for thorough
   visual field tests
   -When stabilized, consider repeat Ca and PTH drawn at same time (PTH
   was normal in setting of high Ca)
   Neuro: MRI T-spine done and showed no overt compressions, but diffuse
   nerve root enhancement of lumbar spine and epidural signal changes at
   T9, T12, L2. Most likely from his overall infiltrative
   process/malignancy. Thoracic epidural enhancement on MRA, MRI
   concerning for possible masses.  Neurosurgery team is  following.
   Patient already on dexamethasone for malignancy treatment. No reported
   incontinence, only retention of urine but may be due to enlarged
   prostate from acromegaly vs additional obstruction at the level of
   ureter as imaging noted thickening of urothelial linings ( likely also
   related to underlying malignancy). Patient also initially presented
   with a Bell
s palsy, possibly related to acromegaly.
   -f/u with neurosurgery regarding T-spine mass and MRI of lumbar spine
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII
   -continue acyclovir
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc and CTX.
   Patient also on Cipro for question of STI orchitis.
   -consider HIV test in setting of possible aggressive lymphoma
   -f/u EBV PCR
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -d/c cipro
   -continue vanc and CTX for hospital-acquired PNA
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   Hcg and AFP negative.
   -Foley in place
   -Closely monitor UOP given recent h/o retention.
   MSK: Patient complained of diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly, possible infiltrative
   process.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Extubated and reintubated yesterday due to tachypnea and
   increased difficulty breathing secondary to copious secretions. Being
   treated for LLL PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant
   process based on chest CT
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow morning
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Get ABG if change in respiratory status or if change ventilator
   settings
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -EKG
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, flow
   cytometry of peripheral blood now pending with high suspicion for an
   acute lymphoma. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -EBV antibodies pending; consider sending PCR if suspicion is high
   given his hypogammaglobulinemia on SPEP
   -continue hydration
   -Today is Day 4 of dexamethasone. Tomorrow start brief taper.
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry pending
   -touch base with neurosurgery to see if CT guided biopsy of spinal mass
   is possible
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine consult
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.  Neurosurgery following. Patient already on
   dexamethasone for malignancy treatment.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary. Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although
   in light of recent ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until
   patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc.
   -Continue [**Month/Year (2) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 4 vancomycin, Day 3 CTX.
   -Increase vanc dosing to 1mg Q8H
   -urine cx negative; sputum and blood cx pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV antibodies pending
   -Legionella negative
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP.
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Extubated and reintubated yesterday due to tachypnea and
   increased difficulty breathing secondary to copious secretions. Being
   treated for LLL PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant
   process based on chest CT
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow morning
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Get ABG if change in respiratory status or if change ventilator
   settings
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -EKG
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, flow
   cytometry of peripheral blood now pending with high suspicion for an
   acute lymphoma. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -EBV antibodies pending; consider sending PCR if suspicion is high
   given his hypogammaglobulinemia on SPEP
   -continue hydration
   -Today is Day 4 of dexamethasone. Tomorrow start brief taper.
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry pending
   -touch base with neurosurgery to see if CT guided biopsy of spinal mass
   is possible
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine consult
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.  Neurosurgery following. Patient already on
   dexamethasone for malignancy treatment.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary. Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although
   in light of recent ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until
   patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc.
   -Continue [**Month/Year (2) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 4 vancomycin, Day 3 CTX.
   -Increase vanc dosing to 1mg Q8H
   -urine cx negative; sputum and blood cx pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV antibodies pending
   -Legionella negative
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP.
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for acromegaly and possible lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress, leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia. The patient has been treated for left lower lobe pneumonia and has shown improvement. His renal function has also improved, but he still requires ongoing medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening of the underlying pneumonia.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and history of hypotension on metoprolol indicate potential cardiovascular issues. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular status is necessary to prevent complications like arrhythmias or heart failure.

3. Renal Complications: The patient initially presented with acute kidney injury (ARF), which has shown improvement. However, ongoing monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent further renal complications.

4. Endocrine Complications: The patient has a new diagnosis of acromegaly, which may explain his initial complaints of cranial nerve palsies, lower extremity weakness, and urinary retention. Close follow-up and management by endocrinology will be required.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial.  Re-intubated for difficulty
   handling copious oral secretions.  Also contibution of pneumonia LLL
   (possible aspiration), diffuse bronchovascular disease with
   lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse
   history, enlarged lung fields).   Improved on mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation trial.
   FEVERS
 persistent, possible underlying systemic process (such as
   symptoms from maligancy) or infection (ex. Pneumonia).  Unrevealing
   imaging.  Cultures pending.  Monitor fevers, use coolig blanket.
   Continue empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxicin)
   ABN BONE MARROW -- biopsy unrevealing for specific diagnosis.  Necrosis
   and many small cells of unclear etiology.  Next plan for peripherlal
   blood sample for flow cytometry analysis.  Will also send bronchoscopy
   BAL for flow cytometry.  Consider repeat Bone Marrow Bx.
   TACHYCARDIA -- consistent with sinus tachycardia with APCs.  Monitor.
   HYPOTENSION
 concern for sepsis and component of hypovolemia.  No
   evidence for adrenal insufficiency.  Improved, and now off
   vasopressors.   Maintain = CVP 10-12 cm H2O.
   FLUIDS
 need to further assess intravascular status.  [**Month (only) 11**] require iv
   fluid bolus to maintain.  Follow CVP= 10-12 cm H2O.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Improving following resuscitation.  Attributed
   to ATN, possible tumor lysis syndrome, bilateral obstruction, drug
   effect.  Creatinine now at baseline.
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
  unclear etiology.  Continue Rasburicase,
   Allopurinol.  Trend electrolytes q8 hrs.  Oncology preliminary
   impression favors ALL/AML
 bone marrow results pending.  Continue
   dexamethasone.
   ACROMEGALLY
 Reportedly with evidnece for Pituitary adenoma.
   Evaluation in progresss.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday but developed copious oral secretions and poor handling of cough, leading to declining SaO2. The patient was re-intubated and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of tobacco abuse and has shown signs of pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease, lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying COPD. The patient's fever persists, and cultures are pending. The patient also has abnormal bone marrow findings, sinus tachycardia with APCs, hypotension, acute renal failure, and possible tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and multiple interventions are being implemented to manage their various complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease, and possible underlying COPD.
2. Fever indicating a possible underlying systemic process or infection.
3. Abnormal bone marrow findings, which may indicate a hematological malignancy such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
4. Sinus tachycardia with APCs, which may indicate cardiac involvement or arrhythmia.
5. Hypotension, possibly due to sepsis and hypovolemia.
6. Acute renal failure, potentially attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), tumor lysis syndrome"

   opacity improved, new small R pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal mass.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Intubated, on assist control mode for past 36 hours after
   failed extubation secondary to copious secretions. Being treated for
   PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on
   chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Daily CXR
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. EKG yesterday showed frequent PVCs,
   no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, now trying to
   obtain diagnosis from alternate tissue.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -d/c dexamethasone today
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry and cytology pending
   -call IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.
   -IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc. CXR on [**7-15**]
   newly concerning for aspiration.
   -Continue [**Month/Day (4) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 5 vancomycin, Day 4 CTX.
   -Add gram-negative coverage for suspected aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgG negative, IgM and PCR pending
   -Legionella negative
   - negative ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA A,B AND, RSV
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal mass.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Intubated, on assist control mode for past 36 hours after
   failed extubation secondary to copious secretions. Being treated for
   PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on
   chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Daily CXR
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. EKG yesterday showed frequent PVCs,
   no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, now trying to
   obtain diagnosis from alternate tissue.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -d/c dexamethasone today
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry and cytology pending
   -call IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.
   -IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc. CXR on [**7-15**]
   newly concerning for aspiration.
   -Continue [**Month/Day (4) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 5 vancomycin, Day 4 CTX.
   -Add gram-negative coverage for suspected aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgG negative, IgM and PCR pending
   -Legionella negative
   - negative ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA A,B AND, RSV
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He has a history of tumor lysis syndrome, suspected lymphoma, and acromegaly. The patient is currently intubated and on assist control mode ventilation due to failed extubation secondary to copious secretions. He has been treated for pneumonia and there is suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.

The patient's cardiovascular status is tachycardic with a heart rate in the 110s/120s. TSH levels are within normal range and a TTE showed normal ejection fraction and no evidence of heart failure. Frequent PVCs were noted on the EKG, but no signs of myocardial ischemia were present.

The patient's renal function is improving, with creatinine levels returning to baseline. He has a Foley catheter in place for urinary retention, which has not been an issue since the catheter was inserted. Electrolyte abnormalities are improving, with repletion as needed.

Endocrine labs show elevated LH and a low testosterone, along with an elevated [**Hospital1 **] level. IGF-1 was normal, but repeat Ca and PTH were both normal, ruling out parathyroid process. The patient has a new diagnosis of acromegaly, with an MRI/MRA showing a pituitary macroadenoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, sputum culture, EKG, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show a fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. The patient's laboratory results indicate renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's current medications include midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and glycemic control is maintained. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest possible acute kidney injury.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show imbalances in potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal mass.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Intubated, on assist control mode for past 36 hours after
   failed extubation secondary to copious secretions. Being treated for
   PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on
   chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean to pressure support as tolerated.
   -Daily CXR
   -Obtain better COPD history
   -Continue abx for 2 more days (7 day total)
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. EKG yesterday showed frequent PVCs,
   no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Start metoprolol 25mg PO TID and titrate as needed.
   -f/u other cardiology recs
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, now trying to
   obtain diagnosis from alternate tissue.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -d/c dexamethasone today
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry and cytology pending
   -biopsy of paraspinal mass not possible per IR. Plan to repeat bone
   marrow bx on monday
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -d/c IVF, start again if CVP<8
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.
   -IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc. CXR on [**7-15**]
   newly concerning for aspiration.
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 5 vancomycin, Day 4 CTX.
   Continue to day 7.
   -Add gram-negative coverage for suspected aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgG negative, IgM and PCR pending
   -Legionella negative
   - negative ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA A,B AND, RSV
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal mass.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Intubated, on assist control mode for past 36 hours after
   failed extubation secondary to copious secretions. Being treated for
   PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on
   chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Daily CXR
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. EKG yesterday showed frequent PVCs,
   no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, now trying to
   obtain diagnosis from alternate tissue.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -d/c dexamethasone today
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry and cytology pending
   -call IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.
   -IR to biopsy paraspinal mass
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc. CXR on [**7-15**]
   newly concerning for aspiration.
   -Continue [**Month/Day (4) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 5 vancomycin, Day 4 CTX.
   -Add gram-negative coverage for suspected aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgG negative, IgM and PCR pending
   -Legionella negative
   - negative ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA A,B AND, RSV
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in the ICU after respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. The patient initially presented with Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 650 mL and RR set at 22. The FiO2 is 50% and PEEP is 5 cmH2O. The ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 244, indicating good oxygenation. The physical examination reveals diffuse wheezing on the left side, decreased bowel sounds, and edematous lower extremities.

The lab results show a WBC count of 5.5, Hct of 27%, Plt of 140,000/mm3, and LDH of 3020 IU/L. The electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The imaging studies show evidence of mild pulmonary vasc congestion, new parenchymal opacity at the left lung apex, and worsening opacity at the right lung base. The CXR also shows a small right pleural effusion.

The assessment and plan include respiratory support, cardiovascular monitoring, heme-oncological workup, renal monitoring, endocrine"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of
   acromegaly and possible lymphoma, in ICU after respiratory distress
   leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive bradycardia, in the
   setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy and urinary retention.
   Current work-up is considering ALL vs Burkitts.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Extubated and reintubated yesterday due to tachypnea and
   increased difficulty breathing secondary to copious secretions. Being
   treated for LLL PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant
   process based on chest CT
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Repeat CXR tomorrow morning
   -Get better COPD history from friend
   -Continue [**Name2 (NI) 114**]
   -Get ABG if change in respiratory status or if change ventilator
   settings
   -f/u blood cx
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure.
   -Continue volume resuscitation to goal CVP of [**10-26**].
   -EKG
   -Avoid beta blockers given h/o hypotension on metoprolol
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, flow
   cytometry of peripheral blood now pending with high suspicion for an
   acute lymphoma. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -d/c dexamethasone today
   -EBV antibodies pending; consider sending PCR if suspicion is high
   given his hypogammaglobulinemia on SPEP
   -continue hydration
   -daily differential
   -BAL flow cytometry pending
   -touch base with neurosurgery to see if CT guided biopsy of spinal mass
   is possible
   Renal/FEN: ARF seems to be resolving with Cre back at baseline of 0.5.
   Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention has not been an issue. This
   will need to be monitored when Foley is eventually removed.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -continue fluids to CVP 10-12
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now.
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly; MRI/MRA shows pituitary
   macroadenoma (presumptive source). This may help explain initial
   complaints of cranial nerve palsies, LE weakness, and urinary retention
   although follow-up for these complaints will be required when patient
   is extubated and stabilized. Only endocrine lab abnormalities to date
   are an elevated [**Hospital1 **] and LH and a low testosterone. Interestingly, IGF-1
   was normal, although this is not reliable in acute illness. Free IGF-1
   level requested by endocrine was not possible at our lab. Repeat Ca and
   PTH were both normal, eliminating suspicion for parathyroid process.
   -f/u endocrine consult
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.  Neurosurgery following. Patient already on
   dexamethasone for malignancy treatment.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary. Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although
   in light of recent ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until
   patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc.
   -Continue [**Month/Year (2) 114**] for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 5 vancomycin, Day 4 CTX.
   -Increase vanc dosing to 1mg Q8H
   -urine cx negative; sputum and blood cx pending
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EB- EBV IgG negative, IgM and PCR pending
   -Legionella negative
   - negative ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3 INFLUENZA A,B AND, RSV
   -- sputum-yeast
   GU:  Initial complaint was urinary retention. Possibly secondary to
   enlarged prostate from acromegaly and/or urothelial thickening on CT.
   Tender scrotal swelling also noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to anasarca and malignancy work-up.
   -Foley in place
   -When patient extubated/stabilized and Foley removed, close follow-up
   will be needed for h/o urinary retention as well as presumptive
   diagnosis of orchitis. No treatment currently given negative G&C swab.
   -Monitor UOP.
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for left lower lobe pneumonia, which indicates an active infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of respiratory failure.
   - Respiratory distress: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress leading to intubation. This could be due to various factors such as lung infection, pulmonary edema, or respiratory muscle weakness.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection acquired during hospitalization.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Tachycardia: The patient has been consistently tachycardic with a heart rate in the range of 110-120 beats per minute. This may be due to fever, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
   - Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotensive bradycardia, which could be related to septic shock or medication effects.
   - Cardiac tamponade: Although not explicitly mentioned, the presence of significant respiratory variation in heart rhythm suggests the possibility of cardiac tamponade, especially considering the patient's history of malignancy.

3. Hematologic Complications:

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial.  Re-intubated for difficulty
   handling copious oral secretions.  Also contibution of pneumonia,
   diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and
   possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse history, enlarged lung
   fields).   Improved on mechanical ventilation.  Monitor ABG, maintain
   pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue antimicrobials.  Hope to work
   towards SBT and extubation trial.
   FEVERS, likely lymphoma, repeat BMBx in 3 days , also Pneumonia
   possibly contributing. Continue empiric antimicrobials (Vanco,
   ceftriaxone)
   ABN BONE MARROW -- biopsy suggested lymphoma, repeat Bone Marrow Bx in
   3 days, stop steroids
   TACHYCARDIA -- consistent with sinus tachycardia with APCs.  Will

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and sedated, indicating difficulty in managing their respiratory function. They have a history of tobacco abuse, enlarged lung fields, and evidence of pneumonia. Mechanical ventilation is being used to assist breathing, and monitoring ABG levels is important to maintain pH within the normal range and ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Fever: The patient has an elevated temperature, which could be due to an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or lymphoma. Empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone) are being continued, and a repeat bone marrow biopsy is planned to investigate the possibility of lymphoma.

3. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing a rapid heart rate consistent with sinus tachycardia with APCs. Metoprolol will be restarted to manage this condition.

4. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: This is a potential complication related to the suspected lymphoma. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent or manage this condition.

5. Acromegaly: The patient has evidence of a pituitary adenoma and elevated HGH levels, suggesting acromegaly.

6. ICU Care: The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and measures are in place to prevent and manage potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial.  Re-intubated for difficulty
   handling copious oral secretions.  Also contibution of pneumonia LLL
   (possible aspiration), diffuse bronchovascular disease with
   lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse
   history, enlarged lung fields).   Improved on mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation trial.
   FEVERS
 persistent, possible underlying systemic process (such as
   symptoms from maligancy) or infection (ex. Pneumonia).  Unrevealing
   imaging.  Cultures pending.  Monitor fevers, use coolig blanket.
   Continue empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxicin)
   ABN BONE MARROW -- biopsy unrevealing for specific diagnosis.  Necrosis
   and many small cells of unclear etiology.  Next plan for peripherlal
   blood sample for flow cytometry analysis.  Will also send bronchoscopy
   BAL for flow cytometry.  Consider repeat Bone Marrow Bx.
   TACHYCARDIA -- consistent with sinus tachycardia with APCs.  Monitor.
   HYPOTENSION
 concern for sepsis and component of hypovolemia.  No
   evidence for adrenal insufficiency.  Improved, and now off
   vasopressors.   Maintain = CVP 10-12 cm H2O.
   FLUIDS
 need to further assess intravascular status.  [**Month (only) 11**] require iv
   fluid bolus to maintain.  Follow CVP= 10-12 cm H2O.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Improving following resuscitation.  Attributed
   to ATN, possible tumor lysis syndrome, bilateral obstruction, drug
   effect.  Creatinine now at baseline.
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
  unclear etiology.  Continue Rasburicase,
   Allopurinol.  Trend electrolytes q8 hrs.  Oncology preliminary
   impression favors ALL/AML
 bone marrow results pending.  Continue
   dexamethasone.
   ACROMEGALLY
 Reportedly with evidnece for Pituitary adenoma.
   Evaluation in progresss.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been re-intubated due to difficulty handling copious oral secretions and possible aspiration pneumonia. They also have diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and underlying COPD is suspected. Monitoring ABG, maintaining pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg, and continuing antimicrobials are recommended.

2. FEVERS: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to an underlying systemic process or infection such as pneumonia. Cultures are pending, and it is advised to monitor fevers and use cooling blankets. Empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin) should be continued.

3. ABN BONE MARROW: The patient's bone marrow biopsy was unrevealing for a specific diagnosis, showing necrosis and many small cells of unclear etiology. A peripheral blood sample for flow cytometry analysis and bronchoscopy BAL for flow cytometry are planned. A repeat bone marrow biopsy may also be considered.

4. TACHYCARDIA: The patient has sinus tachycardia with APCs (atrial premature contractions). Monitoring is recommended.

5. HYPOTENSION: The patient has concern for sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial.  Re-intubated for difficulty
   handling copious oral secretions.  Also contibution of pneumonia,
   diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and
   possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse history, enlarged lung
   fields).   Improved on mechanical ventilation.  Monitor ABG, maintain
   pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue antimicrobials.  Hope to work
   towards SBT and extubation trial.
   FEVERS, likely lymphoma, repeat BMBx in 3 days , also Pneumonia
   possibly contributing. Continue empiric antimicrobials (Vanco,
   ceftriaxone)
   ABN BONE MARROW -- biopsy suggested lymphoma, repeat Bone Marrow Bx in
   3 days, stop steroids
   TACHYCARDIA -- consistent with sinus tachycardia with APCs.  Will
   restart metoprolol
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and sputum culture.
- Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and slightly elevated blood pressure.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- Physical examination reveals acromegaly, neck supple, distant breath sounds in the lungs, and heart tachy.
- Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 5.5-5.8 K/uL, normal hemoglobin levels, and slightly elevated creatinine and lactic acid levels.
- The patient has a history of tobacco abuse and enlarged lung fields.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, but following simple commands.
- The patient has a known allergy to ciprofloxacin.
- The patient received antibiotics including vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes such as handling copious oral secretions, pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying COPD. Close monitoring of ABG values and maintaining pH 7.35-7.40 and pO2 >60 mmHg is necessary. Continuing antimicrobials is important.
2. Fevers: The patient has fevers likely due to lymphoma or pneumonia. Repeat BMBx in 3 days, along with continuing empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone), is advised.
3. Abnormal Bone Marrow: The patient has an abnormal bone marrow biopsy suggesting lymphoma. Repeat Bone Marrow Bx in 3 days and stopping steroids are recommended.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia with APCs. Restarting metoprolol is necessary.
5. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient is at risk for tumor lysis syndrome, which is likely related to lymphoma. Close monitoring of labs is advised.
6. Acromegaly: The patient has acromegaly, possibly with evidence of a pituitary adenoma and elevated HGH levels. Further evaluation and management are needed.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal mass.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Intubated, on assist control s/p 1 failed extubation
   secondary to copious secretions. Has continued to fail daily breathing
   trial. Being treated for PNA, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic
   malignant process based on chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean to pressure support as tolerated
   -Daily CXR
   -Consider expanding antibiotic regimen to vanc/zosyn plus flagyl for
   anaerobes due to possibility of aspiration and opacity in RLL that is
   not resolving
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed no signs of
   myocardial ischemia. Remains tachycardic despite fluid boluses,
   addition of metoprolol, one transfusion. Urine Na 23meq/L suggesting
   absence of hypovolemia.
   -Continue metoprolol 37.5mg TID and titrate up as needed
   -Monitor UOP (currently 30-90mL/hr) and bolus as needed
   -f/u other cardiology recs
   -transfuse again if Hct<21
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, now trying to
   obtain diagnosis from alternate tissue.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx on Monday
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline. Patient has Foley so h/o urinary retention
   has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored when Foley is
   eventually removed. UOP 25-90 cc/hr
   -hypernatremia likely secondary to dehydration
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -bolus IVF as needed
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -consider OGTT in future
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc. CXR on [**7-15**]
   newly concerning for aspiration.
   -On abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Consider expanding regimen and duration.
   -Add gram-negative coverage for suspected aspiration PNA.
   -Repeat blood cx with spikes
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending

","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in the ICU after respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. The patient presented with Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation due to failed extubation secondary to copious secretions. He continues to fail daily breathing trials. He is being treated for pneumonia, suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.

Cardiovascular: The patient is tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH is within normal limits, and TTE showed normal ejection fraction with no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown no signs of myocardial ischemia. The patient remains tachycardic despite fluid boluses, addition of metoprolol, and one transfusion. Urine sodium level is 23 meq/L, suggesting absence of hypovolemia.

Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. All trends are down and now normal. The patient has received two doses of ras"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 123 bpm, hypertension with a blood pressure of 167/76 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% on 50% FiO2. 

The patient's physical examination reveals prominent facial features, wasting in the temporal regions, supple neck, and no lymphadenopathy. The patient has a barrel-shaped chest, regular heart rhythm with distant heart sounds, and diffuse wheezing on the left side. The patient also has decreased bowel sounds, soft and non-distended abdomen, and enlarged hands and feet with edematous lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination is limited due to sedation, but he moves both arms and legs spontaneously.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, and albumin levels. The patient has deranged electrolyte levels including high potassium, low sodium, and magnesium. The patient's renal function tests indicate acute renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Other laboratory abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes, lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease, and possible underlying COPD. The patient was intubated again for difficulty handling copious oral secretions. There is a suspicion of lymphoma based on abnormal bone marrow biopsy results. The patient also has sinus tachycardia with APCs and is on metoprolol. There are concerns about tumor lysis syndrome, acromegaly, and scrotal swelling. The patient's anemia needs to be monitored, and ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, bronchovascular disease, and possible underlying COPD. Continuous monitoring of ABG and maintaining pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg is necessary. Mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever likely due to lymphoma and possible pneumonia. Empiric antimicrobials (Vancomycin and ceftriaxone) should be continued, and repeat BMBx in 2 days is suggested.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia with APCs. Metop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including copious oral secretions, pneumonia, bronchovascular disease, and possible underlying COPD. The patient underwent re-intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 131/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent events include conversion to PSV, increased dose of metoprolol, and transfusion of packed red blood cells.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including difficulty handling copious oral secretions, pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying COPD. The patient requires close monitoring of ABG, maintenance of pH 7.35-7.40, and pO2 >60 mmHg. Empiric antimicrobials should be continued, and the healthcare team hopes to work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial.
2. FEVERS: The patient has a fever likely due to lymphoma or pneumonia. Repeat bone marrow biopsy in 2 days is suggested, along with continuing empiric antimicrobials"

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 650 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits, indicating a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 96%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 202 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.8 g/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.5 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 140 K/uL, blood glucose of 112 mg/dL, and creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's medication regimen includes metoprolol, midazolam, propofol, heparin sodium, famotidine, and various other medications. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheterization increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and heparin should be considered.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections. Regular assessment of vital signs and laboratory parameters"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial.  Re-intubated for difficulty
   handling copious oral secretions.  Also contibution of pneumonia,
   diffuse bronchovascular disease with lymphangitic engorgement, and
   possible underlying COPD (tobacco abuse history, enlarged lung
   fields).   Improved on mechanical ventilation.  Monitor ABG, maintain
   pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.  Continue antimicrobials.  Hope to work
   towards SBT and extubation trial.
   FEVERS, likely lymphoma, repeat BMBx in 3 days , also Pneumonia
   possibly contributing. Continue empiric antimicrobials (Vanco,
   ceftriaxone)
   ABN BONE MARROW -- biopsy suggested lymphoma, repeat Bone Marrow Bx in
   3 days, stop steroids
   TACHYCARDIA -- consistent with sinus tachycardia with APCs.  Will
   restart metoprolol
   TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
  likely lymphoma related,  labs improved
   ACROMEGALLY

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient has respiratory failure due to a combination of factors including pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease, lymphangitic engorgement, and possible underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is being mechanically ventilated and will be monitored for ABG results to maintain pH between 7.35-7.40 and pO2 above 60 mmHg. Antimicrobials will continue, and the healthcare team hopes to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and consider extubation soon.

- The patient also has fevers, likely caused by lymphoma or pneumonia. Empiric antimicrobials (Vancomycin and ceftriaxone) will continue, and a repeat bone marrow biopsy is planned in three days to confirm the presence of lymphoma. Steroids will be stopped.

- The patient has tachycardia, specifically sinus tachycardia with atrial premature complexes (APCs). Metoprolol will be restarted to manage the heart rate.

- There are concerns about tumor lysis syndrome, which is likely related to lymphoma. Lab results have improved.

- The patient reportedly has acromegaly, possibly due to a pituitary adenoma with elevated growth hormone levels.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with recent tumor lysis syndrome. He is being worked up for new diagnoses of acromegaly and B cell lymphoma. The patient experienced respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia in the setting of pneumonia and lactic acidosis.

The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), NS bolus, and 500 cc NS bolus for decreased urine output and cardiac recommendations. His metoprolol dosage was increased to 37.5mg TID. The patient had a conversation with family members and failed rota caps (RISB) in the morning but did well on propofol sedation, showing labored breathing and anxiety once more sedation was lightened. Secretions were mostly above the cuff.

The patient's allergies are listed as no known drug allergies. Antibiotics administered include ceftriaxone and vancomycin on 07/18/2144 at 03:45 AM and 09:00 AM, respectively. The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam (Versed). Other ICU medications include metoprolol, midazolam (Versed), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal mass.
   By system:
   Respiratory: Intubated, one failed extubation secondary to copious
   secretions. Currently on pressure support, requiring high pressure but
   breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA, suspicion for
   infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx for until day 10 (4 more days)
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed no signs of
   myocardial ischemia and frequent PVCs.
   -Switch metoprolol to 50mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -guaiac stool
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis, now trying to
   obtain diagnosis from alternate tissue.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx mon morning
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP 29-90cc/hr
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]). ID approval was received for vanc.
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgG negative, IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in texticular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [**Hospital 7094**]: Intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary to
   copious secretions. Currently on pressure support, requiring high
   pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA; suspicion
   for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx for until day 10 (4 more days)
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -ETT 6.6cm from carina by CXR today, RT will check and advance if
   necessary
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed frequent
   PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Switch metoprolol to 50mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -no IVF necessary now, bolus as needed
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious
   for B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx mon am
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP adequate at 29-90cc/hr. Urine Na
   of 23meq/L suggests absence of marked hypovolemia.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in testicular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   GI: Decreased bowel sounds and last bowel movement 3 days ago.
   -continue colace, senna. Dulcolax added yesterday.
   -try to wean fentanyl to help with gut motility
   -guaiac stool
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [**Hospital 7094**]: Intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary to
   copious secretions.  SIRS. 0 Currently on pressure support, requiring
   high pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA;
   suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on
   chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx (4 more days) (vanco start [**7-13**], cefipine start [**7-18**]),
   start cipro
   -Bronch today, send BAL cxs
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -ETT 6.6cm from carina by CXR today, RT will check and advance if
   necessary
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed frequent
   PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Switch metoprolol to 50mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -no IVF necessary now, bolus as needed
   .
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious
   for B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx mon am
   -peripheral smear pending
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP adequate at 29-90cc/hr. Urine Na
   of 23meq/L suggests absence of marked hypovolemia.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in testicular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   GI: Decreased bowel sounds and last bowel movement 3 days ago.
   -continue colace, senna. Dulcolax added yesterday.
   -try to wean fentanyl to help with gut motility
   -guaiac stool
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia. The patient initially presented with Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
3. Hypotension (not shock)
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
6. Tachycardia, other

The patient has resolving tumor lysis syndrome, pneumonia, respiratory/lactic acidosis, and is being treated for presumed lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT. The patient is intubated, requiring high pressure but breathing spontaneously. The plan includes continuing ventilation and sedation, weaning pressure support as tolerated, daily chest X-ray, sending BAL cxs, continuing antibiotics, and monitoring ABG twice daily.

Cardiovascular: The patient is tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH is within normal limits, and TTE showed normal ejection fraction and no evidence of heart failure. Frequent PVCs were noted on EKGs, but no signs of myocardial ischemia. Metoprolol was switched to 50mg TID, and the patient will be followed up for other cardiology recommendations.

Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. All trends have normalized now, and the patient has received two doses of rasburicase. CT shows evidence of malignancy consistent with lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in the stomach, ureters. Bone marrow biopsy was inadequate secondary to necrosis, although suspicious for B-cell lymphoma.

Renal/FEN: The patient's baseline creatinine has been present for several days. There is a Foley catheter in place, and the patient has not experienced urinary retention. The urine sodium of 23meq/L suggests the absence of marked hypovolemia. Monitoring BUN and Cr, no continuous IVF, bolus as needed, avoiding IV contrast, and nephrotoxic medications for now are part of the plan.

Endocrine: A new diagnosis of acromegaly has been made. Further work-up is of no additional value during the acute illness. Labs and confirmation of the diagnosis as well as additional imaging can be obtained when the patient is stabilized.

Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [**Hospital 7094**]: Intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary to
   copious secretions.  SIRS. 0 Currently on pressure support, requiring
   high pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA;
   suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on
   chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx (4 more days) (vanco start [**7-13**], cefipine start [**7-18**]),
   start cipro
   -Bronch today, send BAL cxs
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -ETT 6.6cm from carina by CXR today, RT will check and advance if
   necessary
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed frequent
   PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Switch metoprolol to 50mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -no IVF necessary now, bolus as needed
   .
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious
   for B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx mon am
   -peripheral smear pending
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP adequate at 29-90cc/hr. Urine Na
   of 23meq/L suggests absence of marked hypovolemia.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in testicular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   GI: Decreased bowel sounds and last bowel movement 3 days ago.
   -continue colace, senna. Dulcolax added yesterday.
   -try to wean fentanyl to help with gut motility
   -guaiac stool

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in the ICU after respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. The patient's original presenting complaint was Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. The patient is currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [Hospital 7094]. The patient is intubated, one failed extubation on [7-15] secondary to copious secretions. Currently on pressure support, requiring high pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA; suspicion for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and reduced mobility.
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has been febrile, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure readings have been low, indicating a potential risk of inadequate tissue perfusion.
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient has demonstrated elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [**Hospital 7094**]: Intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary to
   copious secretions. Currently on pressure support, requiring high
   pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA; suspicion
   for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx for until day 10 (4 more days)
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -ETT 6.6cm from carina by CXR today, RT will check and advance if
   necessary
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed frequent
   PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.
   -Switch metoprolol to 50mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -no IVF necessary now, bolus as needed
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious
   for B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx mon am
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP adequate at 29-90cc/hr. Urine Na
   of 23meq/L suggests absence of marked hypovolemia.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in testicular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   GI: Decreased bowel sounds and last bowel movement 3 days ago.
   -continue colace, senna. Dulcolax added yesterday.
   -try to wean fentanyl to help with gut motility
   -guaiac stool
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress, leading to intubation. He also experienced hypotensive bradycardia and is being treated for pneumonia. The patient's presenting complaints included Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. The patient has a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome and is being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly.

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), hypotension (not shock), acute renal failure, tachycardia (other), and respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS). The patient is intubated and on pressure support, requiring high pressure but breathing spontaneously. He is being treated for pneumonia and there is suspicion for an infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on a chest CT.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Progression of renal failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary. Adjustments in fluid and electrolyte management may be required.
3. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient's fever persists. Continued"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [**Hospital 7094**]: Intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary to
   copious secretions. Currently on pressure support, requiring high
   pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA; suspicion
   for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.  CXR
   show worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx (4 more days) (vanco start [**7-13**], ceftazidime start [**7-18**]),
   start cipro today
   -consider Bronch today, send BAL cxs
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -ETT 6.6cm from carina by CXR today, RT will check and advance if
   necessary
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed frequent
   PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.  Tachycardia is likely
   physiologic as patient has high metabolic demand secondary to
   infection, lymphoma, and high growth hormone
   -Switch metoprolol to 75mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -no IVF necessary now, bolus as needed
   .
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious
   for B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx this am
   -peripheral smear pending
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP adequate at 29-90cc/hr. Urine Na
   of 23meq/L suggests absence of marked hypovolemia.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in testicular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   GI: Decreased bowel sounds and last bowel movement 3 days ago.
   -continue colace, senna. Dulcolax added yesterday.
   -try to wean fentanyl to help with gut motility
   -guaiac stool
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly. He is currently in the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia. The patient's original presenting complaint was Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. He has been treated for pneumonia and there is suspicion for an infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT. CXR shows worsening bibasilar infiltrates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient is sedated and intubated, which can lead to impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube.
2. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin): The patient has had a persistent fever, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which could be related to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated, suggesting possible acute renal failure, especially considering the history of tumor lysis syndrome.
5. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is suspicion of pneumonia and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, fevers, and possible lymphoma. The patient has a history of tobacco abuse and enlarged lung fields. He has been intubated due to difficulty handling copious oral secretions and pneumonia. Empiric antimicrobials (Vanco, ceftriaxone) are being continued. A repeat bone marrow biopsy is suggested to confirm lymphoma. The patient also has sinus tachycardia with APCs, which will be managed with metoprolol. There are concerns about tumor lysis syndrome, acromegally, and anemia. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP precautions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including copious oral secretions, pneumonia, diffuse bronchovascular disease, and possible underlying COPD. Complications may arise if the patient does not improve or if there are further infections.
2. Fever: The patient's fevers may indicate an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or lymphoma. Failure to identify and treat the cause of the fever can lead to worsening of the patient's condition.
3. Lymphoma: The patient has a suspected diagnosis of lymphoma, and complications may arise if the disease progresses or if treatment is ineffective.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure initially due to pneumonia. The patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. There have been recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes, and worsening bibasilar infiltrates are noted on chest X-ray. The patient also has tachycardia, possibly related to sinus tachycardia with atrial premature contractions (APCs), and is on metoprolol. Additionally, there is a suspicion of tumor lysis syndrome, likely related to lymphoma, and the patient is on allopurinol. The patient reportedly has acromegaly with evidence of a pituitary adenoma and elevated human growth hormone (HGH) levels. Further work-up and treatment for acromegaly are on hold. There is mention of scrotal swelling and a planned repeat ultrasound on Monday. The patient has anemia and requires follow-up. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent VAP episodes indicate a risk of ongoing respiratory failure due to pneumonia.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The suspicion of tumor lysis syndrome suggests a potential complication related to the underlying lymphoma.
3. Acromegaly: The presence of a pituitary adenoma and elevated HGH levels indicate the need for further evaluation and management of acromegaly.
4. Scrotal Swelling: The mention of scrotal swelling requires further investigation, which may reveal a potential underlying pathology.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be addressed to improve overall health and prevent further complications.
6. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis due to the risk of deep vein thrombosis associated with prolonged immobility in the ICU.
7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers or gastritis."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx, vanco (start [**7-13**]), ceftazidime (start [**7-18**]), cipro
   (start [**7-19**])
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -continue metoprolol 100mg TID
   -bolus IVF as needed
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -f/u results of second bone marrow bx
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -daily differential
   -peripheral smear pending
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient can be stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak 1.6.
   Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN from
   tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom of
   urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized
   -repeat testicular u/s if appearance worsens
   Distended abdomen: Increasing abdominal distention noted with
   hypoactive bowel sounds.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in the ICU after respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. The patient initially presented with Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, tachycardia, tumor lysis syndrome, anemia, acromegaly, acute renal failure (ARF), orchitis, distended abdomen, neurologic abnormalities, and joint pain.

Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and ventilated due to respiratory distress and worsening bibasilar infiltrates on CXR. Daily CXR and ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status are planned.

Tachycardia: The patient is consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH levels are within normal range, and TTE showed normal EF with no evidence of heart failure. Frequent PVCs are noted on repeat EKGs without signs of myocardial ischemia. Physiologic tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, and high [Hospital1] is suspected. Metoprolol 100mg TID is continued, and IVF as needed.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, suspected lymphoma, and acromegaly. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia. The patient's presenting complaints include Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. He is being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has failed extubation once. He meets the definition of ARDS and is being ventilated at a lower tidal volume. Daily breathing trials are planned to work towards extubation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient is consistently tachycardic, likely due to infection, lymphoma, anemia, and high output state. Metoprolol has been started to manage the heart rate.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has a history of tumor lysis syndrome, characterized by elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia. Rasburicase has been administered, and tumor lysis labs are being trended daily.
4. Acromegaly: The patient presents with acromegalic features and a new presumptive diagnosis of acromegaly. Further work-up is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
5. Anemia: The patient is anemic most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma. He received one unit of PRBCs and will be transfused at Hct < 21.
6. Orchitis: The patient has tender scrotal swelling on admission, which is thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and generalized edema. Further evaluation is needed, and a scrotal ultrasound showed epididymitis/orchitis.
7. Distended Abdomen: The patient has increasing abdominal distention with hypoactive bowel sounds. He is on bowel regimens and fentanyl weaning is being considered.
8. Neurologic Abnormalities: The patient has Bell's Palsy, loss of right facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of lower extremities, and pituitary macroadenoma. Neurosurgery consultation is pending, and MRI of the spine and pituitary are planned.
9. Joint Pain: The patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly. Pain control with fentanyl is ongoing.
10. Social Concerns: The patient's family is focused on the pituitary adenoma and further explanation of lymphoma concerns are warranted. A family meeting with onc and endocrine is scheduled to address these concerns."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx, vanco (start [**7-13**]), ceftazidime (start [**7-18**]), cipro
   (start [**7-19**])
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -continue metoprolol 100mg TID
   -bolus IVF as needed
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -f/u results of second bone marrow bx
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -daily differential
   -peripheral smear pending
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient can be stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak 1.6.
   Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN from
   tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom of
   urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized
   -repeat testicular u/s if appearance worsens
   Distended abdomen: Increasing abdominal distention noted with
   hypoactive bowel sounds.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress leading to intubation. He has a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, suspected lymphoma, and acromegaly. His presenting complaints include Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin, for pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia and a possible infiltrative malignant process. He requires continued ventilation and sedation. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor his condition.
2. Tachycardia: The patient consistently has a heart rate in the 110s/120s. It is likely a physiologic tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, and high hospital stress. Metoprolol 100mg TID will be continued, and IV fluids will be given as needed.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome/Lymphoma: The patient's initial labs showed elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia, consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. LDH levels increased again, and the patient received two doses of rasburicase. A CT"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain tissue for definitive lymphoma diagnosis
   from BAL, peripheral blood, and paraspinal [**Hospital 7094**]: Intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary to
   copious secretions. Currently on pressure support, requiring high
   pressure but breathing spontaneously. Being treated for PNA; suspicion
   for infiltrative lymphangitic malignant process based on chest CT.  CXR
   show worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam
   -Wean pressure as tolerated but likely not much change until breathing
   trial tomorrow am
   -Daily CXR
   -Continue abx (4 more days) (vanco start [**7-13**], ceftazidime start [**7-18**]),
   start cipro today
   -consider Bronch today, send BAL cxs
   -Continue ABG twice daily from art line or if changes in respiratory
   status
   -ETT 6.6cm from carina by CXR today, RT will check and advance if
   necessary
   Cardiovascular: Tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed normal EF
   and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have showed frequent
   PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia.  Tachycardia is likely
   physiologic as patient has high metabolic demand secondary to
   infection, lymphoma, and high growth hormone
   -Switch metoprolol to 75mg TID.
   -f/u other cardiology recs if any.
   -transfuse if Hct<21
   -no IVF necessary now, bolus as needed
   .
   Heme-Onc: Labs at admission included significantly elevated LDH,
   hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor
   lysis syndrome. All trended down and now normal. Now s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT also shows evidence of malignancy
 c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious
   for B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u Heme/Onc recs
   -continue to trend lysis labs (uric acid, LDH, K, phos, Ca) daily
   -continue allopurinol
   -daily differential
   -repeat bone marrow bx this am
   -peripheral smear pending
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
   Renal/FEN: Cre at baseline for several days. Patient has Foley so h/o
   urinary retention has not been an issue. This will need to be monitored
   when Foley is eventually removed. UOP adequate at 29-90cc/hr. Urine Na
   of 23meq/L suggests absence of marked hypovolemia.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   -Electrolyte abnormalities all improving. Replete as needed
   Endocrine: New diagnosis of acromegaly. Per endocrine, further work-up
   is of no additional value during acute illness. Labs and confirmation
   of dx as well as additional imaging can be obtained when patient is
   stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Neuro: MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement concerning for
   possible masses; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   ID: CXR on [**7-12**] showed LLL PNA, being treated with vanc (since [**7-13**])
   and CTX (since [**7-14**]).
   -Continue abx for hospital-acquired PNA. Day 6 vancomycin, Day 5 CTX.
   Continue for 10-14 days.
   -If patient does not recover, consider anaerobic coverage for possible
   aspiration PNA.
   -urine cx negative; sputum cx grew yeast; blood cx from [**7-13**] pending
   -repeat blood cx today
   -HIV test when patient alert and able to consent
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   GU:  Tender scrotal swelling noted on admission and scrotal US
   suggested epididymitis/orchitis. No clear mass was identified and G&C
   swab was negative. Exam today shows marked increase in testicular
   swelling, especially on the left. Thought to be likely due to malignant
   infiltration and generalized edema.
   -f/u urinary retention and orchitis when patient stabilized
   -if testicular appearance worsens, repeat testicular u/s
   GI: Decreased bowel sounds and last bowel movement 3 days ago.
   -continue colace, senna. Dulcolax added yesterday.
   -try to wean fentanyl to help with gut motility
   -guaiac stool
   MSK: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary
   to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam.
   -Patient meets definition of ARDS. Thus, try ventilator at lower tidal
   volume (6cc/kg) with respiratory
s input.
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 8, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 2,start [**7-19**]).
   d/c ceftazidime and start meropenem for possible ESBL (need ID
   approval)
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   -ethics consult for possibly doing HIV test w/o consent in setting of
   acute lymphoma, ARDS
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -change metoprolol 100mg to dose Q6H to try to avoid spikes in HR
   -bolus IVF as needed
   -repeat EKG today
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -f/u results of second bone marrow bx
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -add PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
 daily bactrim
   -daily differential
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
 call
   lab to make sure sample was received
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   -explore possibility of testicular bx if bone marrow inconclusive
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized
   -call urology to discuss possibility of bx if second bone marrow does
   not provide definitive dx
   Distended abdomen: Increasing abdominal distention noted with
   hypoactive bowel sounds. One small stool in last 24 hrs.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   Social:
   -social work consult
   -schedule family meeting with onc and endocrine to address family
   concerns and explain suspicion for lymphoma. Family currently focused
   on the pituitary adenoma and further explanation of lymphoma concerns
   likely are warranted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, intubated, and diagnosed with pneumonia. He has a history of presumed lymphoma, acromegaly, and tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible secondary infection or progression of his underlying conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration, leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has a history of tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to metabolic abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia. These imbalances can result in renal failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Pneumonia: The worsening lung infiltrates and positive findings on bronchoscopy suggest ongoing or worsening pneumonia. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and potential sepsis.
4. Orchitis: The patient has testicular swelling, which could be due to orchitis or malignant infiltration. This requires further evaluation and management.
5. Acromegaly: The patient is suspected to have acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone. Long-term complications of acromegaly"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with respiratory failure, likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as indicated by the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 152. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. Bronchoscopy was performed on 07/19/2144 at 11:50 AM.

The patient has a fever, and there is a potential concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and quinolones have been initiated due to the risk of gram-negative bacteria. Ceftazidime will be changed to a carbapenem due to the risk of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Antibiotics will be continued for 8 days, and if cultures are negative and the patient is not improving after 48-72 hours, consideration will be given to discontinuing antibiotics.

The patient is also suspected to have a lymphoma, and a bone marrow biopsy is pending. There are concerns about tumor lysis syndrome, which is likely related to the lymphoma and has caused an improvement in laboratory values. Allopurinol will be continued to manage this condition.

Other issues include acromegaly, scrotal swelling, anemia, and anemia of chronic disease. Social work follow-up and a family meeting have been scheduled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with ongoing fevers, decreased tidal volumes, and worsening oxygenation. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500cc. The patient's ABG results show increasing carbon dioxide and acidemia. The patient is being started on chemotherapy today. Allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics since admission. Infusions include midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. Metoprolol, famotidine, and heparin sodium are also administered. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fevers. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.9Â°C (103.8Â°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/69 mmHg to 146/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 84.4 kg, and height is 69 inches. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, with total input of 4,493 mL and total output of 1,645 mL. The patient's blood products, urine output, and other fluid balances are also noted. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI deferred due to PEEP > 10. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 52, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 184. The patient's physical examination reveals sedation, intubation, and minimal responsiveness to voice. The patient appears older than stated age with acromegalic features. The patient's cardiac examination shows sinus tachycardia, normal S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient's lung examination reveals diffuse wheezing bilaterally and mild bibasilar crackles. The patient's abdomen is distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient has marked testicular swelling, particularly on the left side. The patient's extremities show no edema or calf pain, and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+. The patient's skin examination is unremarkable except for a tattoo on the right forearm. The patient's neurologic examination is not detailed due to sedation and intubation.

Lab results include a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, sodium of 125 mg/dL, potassium of 0.4 mg/dL, chloride of 26 mEq"

   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam.
   -Patient meets definition of ARDS. Thus, try ventilator at lower tidal
   volume (6cc/kg) with respiratory
s input.
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 8, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 2,start [**7-19**]).
   d/c ceftazidime and start meropenem for possible ESBL (need ID
   approval)
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   -ethics consult for possibly doing HIV test w/o consent in setting of
   acute lymphoma, ARDS
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -change metoprolol 100mg to dose Q6H to try to avoid spikes in HR
   -bolus IVF as needed
   -repeat EKG today
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -f/u results of second bone marrow bx
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -add PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
 daily bactrim
   -daily differential
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
 call
   lab to make sure sample was received
   -EBV IgM and PCR pending
   -explore possibility of testicular bx if bone marrow inconclusive
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized
   -call urology to discuss possibility of bx if second bone marrow does
   not provide definitive dx
   Distended abdomen: Increasing abdominal distention noted with
   hypoactive bowel sounds. One small stool in last 24 hrs.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   Social:
   -social work consult
   -schedule family meeting with onc and endocrine to address family
   concerns and explain suspicion for lymphoma. Family currently focused
   on the pituitary adenoma and further explanation of lymphoma concerns
   likely are warranted.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in the ICU after respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode of hypotensive bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic acidosis. The patient's presenting complaints included Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, tachycardia, tumor lysis syndrome, anemia, acromegaly, acute kidney injury (ARF), orchitis, abdominal distention, neurologic abnormalities, joint pain, and suspected lymphoma.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500cc and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The FiO2 is set at 50%. ABG results show a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 52, and PaO2 of 184. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.9Â°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 119/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem), sedatives (midazolam, propofol), analgesics (fentanyl), and other medications (metoprolol, famotidine, heparin).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocyte count, and platelet count. There are also abnormalities in electrolytes (hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia), kidney function (creatinine), liver enzymes (ALT, AST), lactate levels, LDH, and various other lab values.

The patient's plan includes continuing ventilation and sedation, daily breathing trials, administration of antibiotics, monitoring ABG results, obtaining further diagnostic tests (bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics labs), and management of other medical conditions (tumor lysis syndrome, anemia, acromegaly, ARF, orchitis, abdominal distention, neurologic abnormalities, joint pain).

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -Continue ventilation and sedation with propofol/fentanyl/midazolam.
   -Due to ARDS, keep ventilation at lower tidal volume of 500cc (just
   over 6cc/kg).
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 9, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 3,start [**7-19**])
   and meropenem (day 2, start [**7-20**])
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   -ethics consult for possibly doing HIV test w/o consent in setting of
   acute lymphoma, ARDS
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -metoprolol 100mg Q6H
   -bolus IVF as needed
   -repeat EKG showed
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -to start chemo this morning for B cell lymphoma
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]

   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
 call
   lab to make sure sample was received
   -EBV IgM was negative. PCR pending.
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized
   -call urology to discuss possibility of bx if second bone marrow does
   not provide definitive dx
   Distended abdomen: Increasing abdominal distention noted with
   hypoactive bowel sounds. One small stool in last 24 hrs.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   Social:
   -social work consult
   -schedule family meeting with onc and endocrine to address family
   concerns and explain suspicion for lymphoma. Family currently focused
   on the pituitary adenoma and further explanation of lymphoma concerns
   likely are warranted. Family meeting to be Friday pm.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with multiple medical complications and suspected malignancies. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to pneumonia and suspected infiltrative malignant process, tachycardia likely secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, and high cortisol levels. The patient also has tumor lysis syndrome with elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and is being treated with rasburicase. Additionally, the patient has acromegaly with signs of pituitary macroadenoma and possible cord compression in the thoracic spine. The patient's abdominal distention may be due to bowel obstruction or paralytic ileus. Neurological abnormalities include Bell's palsy, loss of facial sensation, weakness, and decreased sensation in the lower extremities. Joint pain is also present, most likely due to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, decreased tidal volumes, and respiratory distress. The patient's ABG showed acidemia and increasing carbon dioxide. The patient was started on chemo and has been receiving various antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.9Â°C (103.8Â°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 119/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500cc, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and has an RSBI of 62.5 cmH2O/mL. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high sodium, low potassium, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is evidence of skin integrity impairment. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, metoprolol, famotidine, and heparin.

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -switch to Pressure-support to see how it is tolerated. Goal with
   ventilatory today is improve his comfort level in order to be able to
   lift the sedation a little. Wean back propofol.
   -Due to ARDS, keep ventilation at lower tidal volume of 500cc (just
   over 6cc/kg). Hopefully PSV will help with that today.
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 9, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 3,start [**7-19**])
   and meropenem (day 2, start [**7-20**])
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   -ethics consult for possibly doing HIV test w/o consent in setting of
   acute lymphoma, ARDS
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -increase comfort on ventilator with PSV which will hopefully lessen
   tachycardia
   -metoprolol 100mg Q6H
   -bolus IVF as needed
   -repeat EKG showed
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -to start chemo this afternoon for B cell lymphoma
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]
 daily bactrim
   -daily differential
   -f/u cytogenetics labs (Bcr-abl and FISH for 9,22 translocation)
 call
   lab to make sure sample was received
   -EBV IgM was negative. PCR pending.
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -maintain 100cc/hr of urine output while on chemo
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Distended abdomen: Increasing abdominal distention noted with
   hypoactive bowel sounds. One small stool in last 24 hrs.
   -check residuals on tube feeds
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   -consider PO narcan if worsens
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   Social:
   -social work consult
   -schedule family meeting with onc and endocrine to address family
   concerns and explain suspicion for lymphoma. Family currently focused
   on the pituitary adenoma and further explanation of lymphoma concerns
   likely are warranted. Family meeting to be Friday pm.

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of respiratory distress leading to intubation. He is currently in the ICU for pneumonia and suspected infiltrative malignant process. The patient has been diagnosed with resolving tumor lysis syndrome and is being worked up for new diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly. He presented with Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, tachycardia, anemia, acute kidney injury, orchitis, distended abdomen, and neurologic abnormalities. The patient's labs show elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. A bone marrow biopsy showed suspicion for B-cell lymphoma, and a CT scan revealed diffuse evidence of malignancy with lymphangitic spread and thickening in the stomach and ureters.

The patient's treatment plan includes starting chemotherapy for B-cell lymphoma, monitoring tumor lysis syndrome labs, administering dexamethasone, and continuing allopurinol. The patient's care team is also considering a PCP consult, daily Bactrim, and further evaluation for acromegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The care team is attempting to wean him off sedation and plans to perform"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for
   Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Dysonchronous with vent on AC
   requiring significant sedation. PS trials have resulted in either
   acidemia down to 7.12 or dyspnea as patient is requiring minute
   ventilations around 13-15. Contributing factors to respiratory status
   include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as
   well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**].

   is to maximize comfort level and minimize dysynchrony while keeping

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of recent tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. The patient's original presenting complaint was Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. He has been intubated since July 12th and had one failed extubation on July 15th due to copious secretions. He is currently on pressure support and has had trials of pressure support with either acidemia down to 7.12 or dyspnea requiring minute ventilations around 13-15. 

The patient's medical history includes acromegaly, which is a presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features. A definitive work-up has been postponed until the patient is stabilized. He also has anemia most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma, orchitis possibly due to malignant infiltration and generalized edema, a distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, and neurologic abnormalities including Bell's Palsy, loss of right facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of lower extremities, and a pituitary macroadenoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to pneumonia, possible ARDS, and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated, one failed extubation on [**7-15**] secondary
   to copious secretions. Currently on AC. Contributing factors to
   respiratory failure include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative
   malignant process on CT. CXR showing worsening bibasilar infiltrates
   over the weekend.
   -switch to Pressure-support to see how it is tolerated. Goal with
   ventilatory today is improve his comfort level in order to be able to
   lift the sedation a little. Wean back propofol.
   -Due to ARDS, keep ventilation at lower tidal volume of 500cc (just
   over 6cc/kg). Hopefully PSV will help with that today.
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 9, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 3,start [**7-19**])
   and meropenem (day 2, start [**7-20**])
   -f/u BAL results and blood cx
   -ABG twice daily or if changes in respiratory status
   -ethics consult for possibly doing HIV test w/o consent in setting of
   acute lymphoma, ARDS
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -increase comfort on ventilator with PSV which will hopefully lessen
   tachycardia
   -metoprolol 100mg Q6H
   -bolus IVF as needed
   -repeat EKG showed
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. First bone
   marrow biopsy inadequate secondary to necrosis although suspicious for
   B cell lymphoma.
   -to start chemo this afternoon for B cell lymphoma

   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -maintain 100cc/hr of urine output while on chemo
   -no continuous IVF, bolus as needed.
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested

   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   -consider PO narcan if worsens
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with resolving tumor lysis syndrome, being worked up for new
   diagnoses of presumptive lymphoma and acromegaly, in ICU after
   respiratory distress leading to intubation and one episode hypotensive
   bradycardia, in the setting of pneumonia and respiratory/lactic
   acidosis. Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary
   retention, and lower extremity weakness.
   Currently trying to obtain definitive diagnosis of lymphoma to start
   treatment.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Dysonchronous with vent on AC
   requiring significant sedation. PS trials have resulted in either
   acidemia down to 7.12 or dyspnea as patient is requiring minute
   ventilations around 13-15. Contributing factors to respiratory status
   include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as
   well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**].
   -continue trials of pressure support to see how it is tolerated. Goal
   is to maximize comfort level and minimize dysynchrony while keeping
   ph>7.20 and avoid tidal volumes >500cc in the setting of ARDS. Wean
   back propofol as tolerated.
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status,
   permissive hypercapnia but pH>7.20
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA and will be ok to wait as he is receiving high dose chemotherapy
   right now.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 10, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 4,start [**7-19**])
   and meropenem (day 3, start [**7-20**])
   -per ID, added fluconazole 400mg IV daily for ppx given
   immunosuppression
   -sent for cryptococcal serology given yeast in BAL (only pathologic
   organism that could be read as y east. [**Female First Name (un) **] PNA not possible)
   -f/u final BAL results and blood cx
   -ethics consult says go ahead and proceed with HIV test/CD4 count
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -increased comfort on PS yesterday showed less tachycardia, HR in 90s.
   has persisted around 100 even back on AC
   -metoprolol 100mg Q6H
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended down for several
   days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT
   shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - /w lymphangitic spread of
   diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters. Bone marrow
   bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma and hyper-CVAD started on [**7-21**] beginning with
   cyclophosphamide.
   -continue chemo regimen
   -f/u heme/onc recs
   -maintain UOP of 100cc/hr
   -continue allopurinol
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1694**]

   -daily differential
   -EBV PCR pending
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]. Hct stable around 24.
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -maintain 100cc/hr of urine output while on chemo
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. One small stool in last 24 hrs.
   -residuals on tube feeds about 60
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -guaiac stool
   -consider PO narcan if worsens
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for
   Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Dysonchronous with vent on AC
   requiring significant sedation. PS trials have resulted in either
   acidemia down to 7.12 or dyspnea as patient is requiring minute
   ventilations around 13-15. Contributing factors to respiratory status
   include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as
   well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**].
   -continue trials of pressure support to see how it is tolerated. Goal
   is to maximize comfort level and minimize dysynchrony while keeping
   ph>7.20, C02<70.
   -Despite meeting ARDS definition, lung compliance has remained high, so
   large tidal volumes ok to maximize comfort and achieve the high minute
   ventilation he is requiring.
   -leave propofol off if possible
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   -Daily breathing trials in the morning to work toward extubation.
   Limiting factors now include mental status, gag/secretions/resolution
   of PNA and will be ok to wait as he is receiving high dose chemotherapy
   right now.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: Continue vanco (day 10, start [**7-13**]) and cipro (day 4,start [**7-19**]).
   meropenem (day 3, start [**7-20**]) to be discussed with ID (see below)
   -per ID, added fluconazole 400mg IV daily for ppx given
   immunosuppression
   - cryptococcal serology negative
   -f/u final BAL results and blood cx
   -per ethics, ok to proceed with HIV test/CD4 count
   -CXR today indicates possible volume overload, plan to diurese to
   maintain UOP
   Tumor lysis/lymphoma: : Labs at admission included significantly
   elevated LDH, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia,
   hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome. All trended
   down for several days until LDH bumped again startng [**7-17**]. s/p 2 doses
   rasburicase. CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w lymphangitic
   spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in stomach, ureters.
   Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma and hyper-CVAD started on [**7-21**]
   beginning with cyclophosphamide.
   -f/u with heme/onc regarding recs, safety of methotrexate today in
   light of bilateral pleural effusions
   -new thrombocytopenia and leukopenia today, unlikely to be a side
   effect of chemo this early. Talk to ID regarding stopping meropenem
   and/or bactrim as a possible cause. Allopurinol also a potential
   suspect.
   -maintain UOP of 100cc/hr, touch base with onc to see if this is ok if
   we achieve it with lasix drip in place of IVF
   -continue allopurinol for now, although could consider stopping in
   light of low platelets, WBC
   -trend tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -dexamethasone 40mg daily
   -PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
 ?switch from bactrim in light of pancytopenia
   -daily differential
   -EBV PCR pending
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -increased comfort on PS yesterday showed less tachycardia, HR in 90s.
   has persisted around 100 even back on AC
   -decrease metoprolol to 50mg Q6H
   Anemia: Most likely secondary to bone marrow crowding from lymphoma.
   s/p 1 unit PRBCs on [**7-16**]. Hct stable around 24.
   -transfuse at Hct<21
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u endocrine recs
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   ARF, resolved: Cre bumped early in admission from 0.6 baseline to peak
   1.6. Trended down and now stable at 0.5. Thought to be secondary to ATN
   from tumor lysis with a possible contribution from presenting symptom
   of urinary retention.
   -monitor BUN and Cr
   -maintain 100cc/hr of urine output while on chemo
   -avoid IV contrast, nephrotoxic meds for now
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. One small stool in last 48 hrs.
   -residuals on tube feeds about 60
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -consider PO narcan if worsens
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting Friday pm (endocrine available between 12 and 2pm),
   contact family to ensure their presence and request onc

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a recent history of tumor lysis syndrome, who is being treated for Burkitt lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient also has a new diagnosis of acromegaly, and his original presenting complaints included Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure due to pneumonia, suspicion for infiltrative malignant process on CT, and meeting ARDS criteria.

2. Volume Overload: The recent chest X-ray indicates possible volume overload, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.

3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Although the patient received two doses of rasburicase, he continues to have hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. Monitoring of tumor lysis syndrome labs is ongoing, and allopurinol has been started.

4. Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia: The patient's low platelet and white blood cell counts may be due to chemotherapy or possibly related to his underlying condition. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary.

5. Acromegaly: The patient has been diagnosed with acromegaly, and it will require a definitive work-up when the"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for
   Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Intermittent dysynchrony with vent and
   trying to use PSV to ameliorate that. Contributing factors to
   respiratory status include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant
   process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**].
   -Continue PSV, wean pressures as tolerated. Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70.
   -Despite meeting ARDS definition, lung compliance has remained high, so
   large tidal volumes ok to maximize comfort and achieve the high minute
   ventilation he is requiring.
   -leave propofol off
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   -Daily breathing trials while on PSV.
   -Daily CXR
   -Abx: d/c vanco (after 10 days); Continue cipro (day 5,start [**7-19**]),
   meropenem (day 4, start [**7-20**])

   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis
   - fluconazole for ppx  (day 3, start [**7-21**])

s Lymphoma. Labs at
   admission included significantly elevated LDH, hypercalcemia,
   hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia c/w tumor lysis syndrome
   s/p 2 doses rasburicase. CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in

   started on [**7-21**].
   -heme/onc following for chemo. IT cytarabine yesterday, IT MTX today.
   -thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. unlikely to be a side effect of chemo
   this early. ID does not think it is attributable to Bactrim or
   meropenem. Consider allopurinol?
   -Maintain UOP of 100 cc/hr, using lasix gtt, IVF boluses as needed.
   -continue allopurinol for now, although could consider stopping in
   light of low platelets, WBC

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for
   Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Intermittent dysynchrony with vent and
   trying to use PSV to ameliorate that. Contributing factors to
   respiratory status include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant
   process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**]. However,
   compliance has remained normal so tolerating large tidal volumes on
   PSV.
   -Continue PSV, wean pressures as tolerated. Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70.
   -Daily breathing trials while on PSV, follow RISB when weaned toward
   [**5-19**].
   -sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -continue diuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr as it is improving his
   respiratory status
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   -Daily CXR
   -CXR today indicates possible volume overload, plan to diurese to
   maintain UOP
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -HIV-negative
   -D/c vanco today (10 days of total tx)
   -D/c meropenem today (3 days of total tx)
   -Continue cipro (day 5,start [**7-19**])
   -Start cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 1)
   -Start flagyl 500mg IV TID (day 1)
   -Start doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 2)
   -Continue fluconazole for ppx  (day 3, start [**7-21**])
   -Start acyclovir for ppx (day 2)
   -Stop Bactrim in setting of pancytopenia
   -Start Atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**], 1500mg PO daily (day 1)
   -check G6PD for above
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis
   -f/u final BAL results and blood cx
   -send CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx
   -CSF EBV PCR
   -serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR
   -galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 2 doses rasburicase. Tumor lysis labs started
   to rise again on [**7-21**].
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q6H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr with lasix gtt
   -repeat rasburicase 6mg x 1
   -continue allopurinol
   -change tube feeds to low phos
   -add phos binder (sevelemer possible through OGT?)
   -add kaexelate
   -renal consult in setting of worsening lab values with distinct
   possibility of needing dialysis in near future
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p 4 doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1
   -f/u onc recs
   -intrathecal methotrexate today
   -dexamethasone daily 40mg
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.
   -Transfuse PRBCs at Hct<21
   -give platelets if needed
   -CBC Q8H
   -start neupogen on [**7-24**]
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -repeat EKG
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 3 days.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -Add PO narcan or investigate possibility of SC methylnaltrexone for
   gut motility
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting [**Hospital1 1583**] pm (endocrine available between 12 and 2pm),
   contact family to ensure their presence and request onc
s presence as
   well
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of recent tumor lysis syndrome, starting chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma, and a new diagnosis of acromegaly. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possible ARDS, and intubated since July 12th. He has also had failed extubation on July 15th secondary to copious secretions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/56 to 87/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. His physical examination shows acromegalic features, supple neck, distant heart sounds with sinus tachycardia, CTAB, mildly distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, and marked testicular swelling without heat or redness.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, elevated LDH, and other abnormalities. The patient is neutropenic with an ANC <500 following chemotherapy. Imaging studies show diffuse evidence of malignancy with lymphangitic spread of a diffuse malignant process, thickening in the stomach and ureters, and a pituitary macroadenoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of lymphoma and currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to an upper airway obstruction caused by a tumor mass. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and is on multiple antibiotics for suspected sepsis. The patient's condition has been complicated by impaired skin integrity, fever, hypotension, acute renal failure, tachycardia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2Â°F (39Â°C), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/56 mmHg to 129/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
2. Fever: The patient's fever indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may indicate septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is essential.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Intermittent dysynchrony with vent,
   PSV has increased his comfort level.  Contributing factors to
   respiratory status include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant
   process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**]. However,
   compliance has remained normal so tolerating large tidal volumes on
   PSV.
   -Continue PSV, wean pressures as tolerated. Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70.
   -Daily breathing trials while on PSV, follow RISB when weaned toward
   [**5-19**]. (RISB today 15 on PSV 10/10, Vt 800, Rate 12)
   -Sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue diuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr as it is improving his
   respiratory status and as his Na level tolerates
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   -Daily CXR
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)

   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 2 doses rasburicase. Tumor lysis labs started
   to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are trending down.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q6H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr with lasix gtt and HC03 IVF as long as
   Na<150
   -s/p 3^rd dose rasburicase
   -continue allopurinol
   -low phos tube feeds
   -started aluminum hydroxide for PO phos binding
   -continue kaexelate
   -renal consult in setting of worsening lab values with distinct
   possibility of needing dialysis (CVVHD?) in near future
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, m
   -f/u onc recs
   -consult rad-onc for possibility of radiation to skull in light of
   cranial nerve palsies. Likely will need imaging first.
   -intrathecal methotrexate today
   -dexamethasone daily 40mg
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.
   -s/p 3 units of PRBCs over last 48 hours
   -give platelets if needed
   -CBC Q8H
   -start neupogen today
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG from [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 4 days.
   -Colace increased, receiving senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1. repeat if no stool in 24h
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting today (endocrine available between 12 and 2pm), contact
   family to ensure their presence and request onc
s presence as well
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

The goal is to maintain a pH >7.20 and CO2 <70. Daily breathing trials while on PSV should be continued, and the RISB should be followed when weaning towards a PSV of 5-10.
2. Pneumonia/Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on CXR. His WBC count was elevated on 07/18 but has now precipitously dropped in setting of chemotherapy. He is now neutropenic (ANC <500).

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Intermittent dysynchrony with vent,
   PSV has increased his comfort level.  Contributing factors to
   respiratory status include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant
   process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**]. However,
   compliance has remained normal so tolerating large tidal volumes on
   PSV.
   -Continue PSV, wean pressures as tolerated to [**5-19**] today.
   -Breathing trial today, follow RISB when weaned toward [**5-19**]. (RISB today
   15 on PSV 10/10, Vt 800, Rate 12)
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue diuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr as it is improving his
   respiratory status and as his Na level tolerates
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -Vanco and meropenem d/c

   total)
   -cipro (day 6,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 2)
   -flagyl 500mg IV TID (day 2)
   -touch base with ID regarding stopping flagyl today, cipro tomorrow to
   increase number of abx
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 3)
   -fluconazole for ppx  (day 4, start [**7-21**])
   -Start acyclovir for ppx (day 3)
   -Bactrim d/c
ed, continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 2)
   -check G6PD for above, if negative, switch to dapsone
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis pending
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 2 doses rasburicase. Tumor lysis labs started
   to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are trending down.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr with lasix gtt
   -check urine pH tomorrow
   -stop HC03 as respiratory status better with less IVF and tumor lysis
   labs stable
   -s/p 3^rd dose rasburicase
   -continue allopurinol
   -low phos tube feeds
   -started aluminum hydroxide for PO phos binding
   -continue kaexelate
   -renal consult in setting of worsening lab values with distinct
   possibility of needing dialysis (CVVHD?) in near future
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, m
   -f/u onc recs
   -consult rad-onc for possibility of radiation to skull in light of
   cranial nerve palsies. Likely will need imaging first.
   -intrathecal methotrexate today
   -dexamethasone daily 40mg
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.
   -s/p 3 units of PRBCs over last 48 hours
   -give platelets if needed
   -CBC Q8H
   -start neupogen today
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG from [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 4 days.
   -Colace increased, receiving senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1. repeat if no stool in 24h
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting today (endocrine available between 12 and 2pm), contact
   family to ensure their presence and request onc
s presence as well
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, undergoing chemotherapy for Burkitt's lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. The patient also has new diagnoses of acromegaly and Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's ongoing fevers and persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest ongoing infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued and adjusted based on culture results. Close monitoring for clinical improvement or deterioration is essential.

3. Tumor lysis syndrome: Although the patient's labs are currently trending down, there is a risk of recurrence due to ongoing chemotherapy. Frequent monitoring of tumor lysis syndrome markers and prompt management with rasburicase and allopurinol if necessary is crucial.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient's drop in white blood cell count and platelets indicates pancytopenia. Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate management with growth factors and blood products as needed is necessary.

5. Acromegaly: The patient's new presumptive diagnosis of acromegaly requires further evaluation and"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Intermittent dysynchrony with vent,
   PSV has increased his comfort level.  Contributing factors to
   respiratory status include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant
   process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**]. However,
   compliance has remained normal so tolerating large tidal volumes on
   PSV.
   -Continue PSV, wean pressures as tolerated to [**5-19**] today.
   -Breathing trial today, follow RISB when weaned toward [**5-19**]. (RISB today
   15 on PSV 10/10, Vt 800, Rate 12)
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue diuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr as it is improving his
   respiratory status and as his Na level tolerates
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -Vanco and meropenem d/c
ed yesterday (10 days vanco, 3 days [**Last Name (un) **]
   total)
   -cipro (day 6,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 2)
   -flagyl 500mg IV TID (day 2)
   -touch base with ID regarding stopping flagyl today, cipro tomorrow to
   increase number of abx
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 3)
   -fluconazole for ppx  (day 4, start [**7-21**])
   -Start acyclovir for ppx (day 3)
   -Bactrim d/c
ed, continue atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 2)
   -check G6PD for above, if negative, switch to dapsone
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis pending
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 2 doses rasburicase. Tumor lysis labs started
   to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are trending down.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr with lasix gtt
   -check urine pH tomorrow
   -stop HC03 as respiratory status better with less IVF and tumor lysis
   labs stable (could consider oral HC03)
   -s/p 3^rd dose rasburicase
   -continue allopurinol
   -low phos tube feeds
   -aluminum hydroxide for PO phos binding
   -continue kaexelate
   -f/u renal recs
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, m
   -f/u onc recs
   -vincristine and doxorubicin today
   -consult rad-onc for possibility of radiation to skull in light of
   cranial nerve palsies. Likely will need imaging first. (Hold off on
   this for now)
   -intrathecal methotrexate today
   -dexamethasone daily 40mg
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.
   -s/p 3 units of PRBCs over last 48 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -start neupogen today
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 4 days.
   -Colace increased, receiving senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1. repeat if no stool in 24h
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -add PO narcan
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200s starting [**7-23**]. likely largely
   due to the dexamethasone.
   -increase ISS. If persists in the 200s add insulin drip.
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting today for providing more information about diagnoses
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, undergoing chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma. He has been diagnosed with acromegaly and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, with a possible ARDS. The patient presented with Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. He has been intubated since July 12th and had one failed extubation on July 15th.

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with CPAP/PSV ventilation, and his ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 56, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 216. The patient's physical examination reveals acromegalic features, neck supple without any LAD, and marked testicular swelling without heat or redness.

Laboratory findings show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. The patient has received multiple doses of rasburicase and allopurinol for tumor lysis syndrome, as well as chemotherapy agents like cyclophosphamide and cytarabine. He is also on various antibiotics and antiviral medications.

The patient's pancytopenia is being managed with blood product transfusions and neupogen. His hyperglycemia is likely due to dexamethasone. The patient"

   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], one failed extubation on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions. Intermittent dysynchrony with vent,
   PSV has increased his comfort level.  Contributing factors to
   respiratory status include PNA and suspicion for infiltrative malignant
   process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting [**7-18**]. However,
   compliance has remained normal so tolerating large tidal volumes on
   PSV.
   -Continue PSV, wean pressures as tolerated to [**5-19**] today.
   -Breathing trial today, follow RISB when weaned toward [**5-19**]. (RISB today
   15 on PSV 10/10, Vt 800, Rate 12)
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue diuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr as it is improving his
   respiratory status and as his Na level tolerates
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R

   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 2 doses rasburicase. Tumor lysis labs started
   to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are trending down.

   -dexamethasone daily 40mg
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.
   -s/p 3 units of PRBCs over last 48 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)

   -start neupogen today
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 4 days.
   -Colace increased, receiving senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1. repeat if no stool in 24h
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -add PO narcan
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200s starting [**7-23**]. likely largely
   due to the dexamethasone.
   -increase ISS. If persists in the 200s add insulin drip.
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting today for providing more information about diagnoses
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of Burkitt's lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been intubated since July 12th and has experienced two failed extubations. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by pneumonia and a possible infiltrative malignant process, as well as meeting ARDS criteria starting July 18th. He is currently comfortable on assist-control ventilation and is being weaned off sedation.

The patient has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on CXR. His WBC count was elevated on July 18th but has now dropped in the setting of chemotherapy, leaving him neutropenic (ANC < 500). He has received a 10-day course of vancomycin, which has been discontinued, as well as three days of meropenem, which will be discontinued on July 25th. He will also receive ciprofloxacin starting July 19th and cefepime 2gm IV q8h starting July 21st. Prophylaxis with fluconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone for PCP has been initiated.

The patient also has tumor lysis syndrome, which resolved to baseline but reappeared on July 21st. He has received three doses of rasburicase and is currently stable. His tumor"

   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Continue CMV/ PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Continue CMV/PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Start lasix gtt if
   needed but monitor metabolic alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy. Contact IP tomorrow. Call HCP
   today to set up a meeting to discuss that early this week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -cipro (day 8,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 4)
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 5)
   -Start vanco again today for fever, neutropenia.
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum cx if
   possible
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 6, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 5),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 4: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis negative
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing
   -continue allopurinol
   -increase phos in tube feeds in setting of phos back to normal/low
   today
   -renal following in case of tumor lysis induced ATN again. Cre
   currently stable.
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -f/u onc recs
   -IT chemo today, give platelets first
   - continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen started yesterday
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 6 days.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1 and PO narcan.
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -restart tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   -repeat LFTs
   -KUB
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W and acromegaly.
   -started insulin drip with goal BG 100-150mg/dL
   -may be able to transition to less intensive insulin protocol when
   patient is no longer receiving steriods
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend), will contact today
   regarding possibility of trach.
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. He is intubated and on ventilatory support. The patient has recently been diagnosed with acromegaly, Burkitt's lymphoma, and shows signs of pancytopenia. He is also experiencing hyperglycemia, distended abdomen, tachycardia, and joint pain. The patient is neutropenic and has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray. He requires aggressive management of his conditions, including chemotherapy, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of continued respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS.
2. Infection: The patient is neutropenic and has persistent fevers, indicating an increased risk of infection. There is a concern for ongoing pneumonia and potential sepsis.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has a history of tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to metabolic abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and renal failure.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing pancytopenia, characterized by low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and low hemoglobin levels. This increases the risk of bleeding, infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Continue CMV/PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Patient autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr, do not restart lasix
   gtt now in setting of metabolic alkalosis prior to extubation
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy in the future when condition has
   stabilized
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -cipro (day 8,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 4)
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 5)
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 6, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 5),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 4: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis pending
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing
   -stop HC03 as respiratory status better with less IVF and tumor lysis
   labs stable (could consider oral HC03)
   -continue allopurinol
   -low phos tube feeds
   -continue kaexelate
   -f/u renal recs
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin yesterday, s/p
   intrathecal methotrexate
   -f/u onc recs
   -consult rad-onc for possibility of radiation to skull in light of
   cranial nerve palsies. Likely will need imaging first. (Hold off on
   this for now)
   - continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen started yesterday
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 6 days.
   -Colace increased, receiving senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1 and PO narcan.
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   - restart tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W and acromegaly.
   -started insulin drip with goal BG 100-150mg/dL
   - may be able to transition to less intensive insulin protocol when
   patient is no longer receiving steriods
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting yesterday for providing more information about
   diagnoses
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, undergoing chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS, and new diagnosis of acromegaly. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 107/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. 

The patient is intubated and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume set at 500 mL. The plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O, and PEEP is at 10 cmH2O. FiO2 is currently 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, HCO3- of 111 mEq/L, Na+ of 134 mEq/L, Cl- of 103 mEq/L, K+ of 7.3 mEq/L, and glucose of 177 mg/dL. 

The patient has a history of recent chemotherapy, during which he developed tumor lysis syndrome. His current labs show a WBC count of 0.1 K/uL, Hct of 23.4%, Plt of 21, Cr of 0.5 mg/dL, TCO2 of 34, and amylase/lipase levels within normal limits. The patient's electrolytes are somewhat imbalanced with hypokalemia (K+ of 7.3 mEq/L) and hyperphosphatemia (PO4 of 1.9 mg/dL). 

The patient also has a pancytopenia with a precipitous drop in WBC count following chemotherapy, as well as thrombocytopenia (Plt of 21). He is neutropenic with an ANC below 500. 

Other notable findings include acromegalic features, left facial droop, mild distension of the abdomen, and somewhat diminished testicular swelling. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, chemotherapy agents, pain control, insulin, and other supportive care measures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include further respiratory distress, infection due to neutropenia, tumor lysis syndrome recurrence, and complications related to his acromegaly diagnosis."

   - D51/2NS at 75cc/L to help resolve hypernatremia
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W and acromegaly.
   -started insulin drip with goal BG 100-150mg/dL
   - may be able to transition to less intensive insulin protocol when
   patient is no longer receiving steriods
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting yesterday for providing more information about
   diagnoses
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of recent tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma, and a new diagnosis of acromegaly. The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. He has been intubated since July 12th and experienced two failed extubations. The patient also has Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness. He is neutropenic with an ANC below 500 following chemotherapy. Other medical conditions include pancytopenia, hyperglycemia, distended abdomen, and joint pain. The patient requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for various complications such as pneumonia/infection, tumor lysis syndrome, Burkitt lymphoma, pancytopenia, tachycardia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on CXR, indicating a possible ongoing infection. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has a history of tumor lysis syndrome, and his labs are showing signs of elevated LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphat"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Continue CMV/PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Patient autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr, do not restart lasix
   gtt now in setting of metabolic alkalosis prior to extubation
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy in the future when condition has
   stabilized
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -cipro (day 8,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 4)
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 5)
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 6, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 5),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 4: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis pending
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing
   -stop HC03 as respiratory status better with less IVF and tumor lysis
   labs stable (could consider oral HC03)
   -continue allopurinol
   -low phos tube feeds
   -continue kaexelate
   -f/u renal recs
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin yesterday, s/p
   intrathecal methotrexate
   -f/u onc recs
   -consult rad-onc for possibility of radiation to skull in light of
   cranial nerve palsies. Likely will need imaging first. (Hold off on
   this for now)
   - continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen started yesterday
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg Q6H
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 6 days.
   -Colace increased, receiving senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1 and PO narcan.
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   - restart tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W and acromegaly.
   -started insulin drip with goal BG 100-150mg/dL
   - may be able to transition to less intensive insulin protocol when
   patient is no longer receiving steriods
   Social:
   -social work consulted
   -family meeting yesterday for providing more information about
   diagnoses
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, recent chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma, and a new diagnosis of acromegaly. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient has been intubated since July 12th, with two failed extubations on July 15th and July 25th. He is comfortable on assisted control ventilation (AC) and tolerating large tidal volumes on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on chest X-ray, indicating a possible infection. His white blood cell count has dropped precipitously after chemotherapy, and he is now neutropenic (ANC < 500). He has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, and is currently on a regimen of fluconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone for prophylaxis against fungal, viral, and Mycoplasma hominis infections.

The patient's labs show elevated LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia, which have resolved to baseline. He has been treated with rasburicase and allopurinol for tumor lysis syndrome, which is currently stable. The patient's renal function is monitored closely, and he has received blood products and plate"

   Attending Note: I saw and examined the patient, and was physically
   present with the ICU team for the key portions of the services
   provided. I agree with the note above, including the assessment and
   plan. I would emphasize and add the following points: 40M ARDS,
   lymphoma, acromegaly, Bell's palsy, with tumor lysis syndrome
   Impression: complicated case. Currently neutropenic and febrile, and
   s/p second re-intubation.
   Agree with plan to wean FiO2/peep as tolerated. From a respiratory
   perspective, once he is more stable, afebrile and pancytopenia
   improving, he will almost certainly require a tracheostomy. This was
   discussed briefly with Mr [**Known lastname 7019**] again this morning but a meeting
   should be set up with HCP.
   Febrile/neutropenia - would restart Vancomycin. Continue other Abx -
   cipro d8, cefepime d 4, doxy d5. Will continue broad antibiotic
   coverage for M. hominis / nosocomial aspiration / VAP and prophylaxis
   for neutropenia / fever.
   Lymphoma/Tumor lysis syndrome - labs relatively stable. IT chemo to be
   given today. C/w allopurinol. Continue chemo for Burkitt's lymphoma;
   will continue to treat tumor lysis with dex and allopurinol - numbers
   are improving s/p rasburicase. WBC and plts appear to be at nadir -
   continue to monitor, on neupogen and continue with blood product
   support.
   Endocrine following for acromegaly / macroadenoma, no immediate plans
   for treatment; no evidence of pituitary hypofunction at this point.
   Will continue PCP prophylaxis while on high dose steroids. On insulin
   drip for hyperglycemia. Continue TFs.
   On PPI, SCH and remains full code. HCP is friend [**Name (NI) **].
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident's note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 40-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), lymphoma, acromegaly, Bell's palsy, and tumor lysis syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several complications.

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to prolonged immobility or pressure ulcers caused by lying in one position for a long time.

2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has been febrile, indicating an infection or inflammatory response in the body. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has low blood pressure, which could be due to sepsis, dehydration, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and urea. This could be caused by factors such as inadequate perfusion, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.

5. Lymphoma (cancer, malignant neoplasm, lymphoid): The patient has a history of lymphoma, which is a type of cancer affecting the lymphatic system. Treatment for the lymphoma is ongoing.

6. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS/[**Doctor"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -CXR this morning worse and patient reporting subjective dyspnea.
   Possibly related to IVF overload.
   -Continue CMV/PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Start lasix gtt if
   needed but monitor metabolic alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy, which was addressed with HCP
   and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. Contact IP
   today.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500).
   -A-line grew gram positive cocci in clusters. Consider pulling the
   line.
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -cipro (day 9,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 5)
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 6)
   -Started vanco again yesterday for fever, neutropenia. (day 2 today)
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum cx if
   possible
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 7, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 6),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 5: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis negative
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Lasix boluses as
   needed.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low/normal, monitor as return to normal tube feeds
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -touch base with onc regarding back pain
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen day 3 (hold day 10 and 11, [**7-30**] and [**7-31**])
   -DIC labs Q24H
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 7 days but now passing gas.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1 and PO narcan.
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   -repeat LFTs normal
   -KUB
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Pain control: significant back and joint pain today in setting of
   sedation weaned.
   -bolus fentanyl as needed
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend). They support a
   trach if that becomes necessary/possible
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, newly diagnosed with acromegaly, and currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient has been intubated multiple times and is now comfortable on assisted control. There are several potential medical complications to consider.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to the underlying pneumonia, suspicion of an infiltrative malignant process, and meeting ARDS criteria. The patient is currently tolerating large tidal volumes on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but may require tracheostomy if necessary.

2. Infection/Pneumonia: The patient has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on chest X-ray. The white blood cell count was elevated before starting chemotherapy but has now dropped to neutropenic levels. There is also a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci in clusters, which could indicate a possible line infection. Antibiotic coverage has been adjusted accordingly.

3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient initially presented with elevated LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia, which have since resolved. However, tumor lysis labs started to rise again, indicating a potential recurrence. Rasburicase has been administered, and labs will be followed closely.

4. Burkitt's Lymphoma: The patient has been diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Continue CMV/PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Start lasix gtt if
   needed but monitor metabolic alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy. Contact IP tomorrow. Call HCP
   today to set up a meeting to discuss that early this week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -cipro (day 8,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 4)
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 5)
   -Start vanco again today for fever, neutropenia.
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum cx if
   possible
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 6, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 5),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 4: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis negative
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing
   -continue allopurinol
   -increase phos in tube feeds in setting of phos back to normal/low
   today
   -renal following in case of tumor lysis induced ATN again. Cre
   currently stable.
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -f/u onc recs
   -IT chemo today, give platelets first
   - continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen started yesterday
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 6 days.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1 and PO narcan.
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -restart tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   -repeat LFTs
   -KUB
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W and acromegaly.
   -started insulin drip with goal BG 100-150mg/dL
   -may be able to transition to less intensive insulin protocol when
   patient is no longer receiving steriods
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend), will contact today
   regarding possibility of trach.
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Continue CMV/PS as per patient comfort, wean FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated
   -Wean sedation with fentanyl/midazolam
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Start lasix gtt if
   needed but monitor metabolic alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy. Contact IP tomorrow. Call HCP
   today to set up a meeting to discuss that early this week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500)
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -cipro (day 8,start [**7-19**])
   -cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 4)
   -doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for mycoplasma coverage (day 5)
   -Start vanco again today for fever, neutropenia.
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum cx if
   possible
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 6, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 5),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 4: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -urine cx for Mycoplasma hominsis negative
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing
   -continue allopurinol
   -increase phos in tube feeds in setting of phos back to normal/low
   today
   -renal following in case of tumor lysis induced ATN again. Cre
   currently stable.
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -f/u onc recs
   -IT chemo today, give platelets first
   - continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen started yesterday
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 6 days.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -s/p methylnaltrexone x1 and PO narcan.
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -restart tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   -repeat LFTs
   -KUB
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W and acromegaly.
   -started insulin drip with goal BG 100-150mg/dL
   -may be able to transition to less intensive insulin protocol when
   patient is no longer receiving steriods
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend), will contact today
   regarding possibility of trach.
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma, and a new diagnosis of acromegaly. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing fever, neutropenia, and an elevated white blood cell count. He has received multiple courses of antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime. His sputum culture grew coagulase-positive staphylococcus, and he has been started on vancomycin again.

The patient has also shown signs of pancytopenia, with a low platelet count and neutropenic fever. He has been given platelet transfusions as needed and is currently receiving neupogen.

He has a history of distended abdomen, hypoactive bowel sounds, and no stool for six days. He has been given medications to stimulate bowel movements and is currently on tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been in the range of 200-300 mg/dL due to dexamethasone, antibiotics in D50W, and acromegaly. He has been started on an insulin drip with a goal blood glucose level of 100-150 mg/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -CXR this morning worse and patient reporting subjective dyspnea.
   Possibly related to IVF overload.
   -Increase PEEP to 10 for increased comfort, continue CMV on [**8-24**]
   changing for patient comfort. Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated but this is not a priority as patient has failed 2
   extubations and we are not planning imminent extubation in his state of
   critical illness, fever, immunocompromise, and chemotherapy.
   -Keep sedation off as long as patient as comfortable with bolus IV
   fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Start lasix gtt.
   -monitor mixed alkalosis with ABG in hopes increased PEEP will help.
   Start acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy, which was addressed with HCP
   and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He is not a
   candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as a goal
   toward the end of the week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500).
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 6)
   and cipro (day 9,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 2); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 5)
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -A-line grew gram positive cocci in clusters. Covered with vanc
   -resite A-line, pull IJ for line holiday with onc permission
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 7, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 6),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 5: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Start lasix gtt
   again.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low/normal, monitor as return to normal tube feeds
   -replete K as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc. Request detailed
   plan for chemo over next few weeks to plan accordingly with access,
   dexamethasone, LPs, etc.
   -touch base with onc regarding back pain and if is expected in setting
   of IT MTX yesterday
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen day 3 (hold day 10 and 11, [**7-30**] and [**7-31**])
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 7 days but now passing gas.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   - continue PO narcan but monitor for increased pain
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   -repeat LFTs normal
   -KUB showed large amount of stool, likely impaction
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Pain control: significant back and joint pain today in setting of
   sedation weaned.
   -bolus fentanyl as needed
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend). They support a
   trach if that becomes necessary/possible.
   -social work consult
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of recent tumor lysis syndrome, chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma, new diagnosis of acromegaly, and respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy planned. He has pancytopenia, tachycardia, abdominal distention, hyperglycemia, and pain. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical issues including Burkitt lymphoma, acromegaly, infection, and potential complications from chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing despite being on mechanical ventilation. The presence of pneumonia and possible ARDS increases the risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has persistent fevers and infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating an ongoing infection. The organism causing the pneumonia needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Although the patient's labs have returned to baseline, there is a concern for recurrence of tumor lysis syndrome due to the ongoing malignancy and recent chemotherapy.
4. Acromegaly: The patient's symptoms suggest a new diagnosis of acromegaly, which needs further evaluation and management.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's low platelet count, white blood cell count, and hematocrit indicate pancytopenia. This increases the risk of bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Patient subjectively comfortable this morning on PSV 8/10. Increased
   PEEP likely helps him.
   -Large amount of secretions, consider bronch to clean him out a little.
   Lasix drip not ameliorating this.
   -Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated but this is not a priority
   as patient has failed 2 extubations and we are not planning imminent
   extubation in his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Keep sedation off as long as patient as comfortable with bolus IV
   fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Increased lasix gtt to
   4mg.
   -monitor mixed alkalosis with ABG in hopes increased PEEP will help.
   Start acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy, which was addressed with HCP
   and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He is not a
   candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as a goal
   toward the end of the week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500).

   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, recently diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient has a new diagnosis of acromegaly and is intubated since July 12th. He has had two failed extubations on July 15th and July 25th. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination reveals diffuse petechiae, diminished testicular swelling, and 3+ pitting edema. Laboratory results show a WBC count of 0.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, sodium of 129 mg/dL, potassium of 24 mEq/L, and lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. The patient is neutropenic with an ANC <500. He has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on CXR and is receiving multiple antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with copious secretions. The plan is to continue with noninvasive ventilation (NIPPV) and consider tracheostomy if needed. Pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Patient subjectively comfortable this morning on PSV 8/10. Increased
   PEEP likely helps him.
   -Large amount of secretions, consider bronch to clean him out a little.
   Lasix drip not ameliorating this.
   -Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated but this is not a priority
   as patient has failed 2 extubations and we are not planning imminent
   extubation in his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Keep sedation off as long as patient as comfortable with bolus IV
   fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Increased lasix gtt to
   4mg.
   -monitor mixed alkalosis with ABG in hopes increased PEEP will help.
   Start acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy, which was addressed with HCP
   and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He is not a
   candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as a goal
   toward the end of the week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500).
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 7)
   and cipro (day 10,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 3); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 6)
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 8, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 7),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 6: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Start lasix gtt
   again.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low/normal, monitor as return to normal tube feeds
   -replete K as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc. Request detailed
   plan for chemo over next few weeks to plan accordingly with access,
   dexamethasone, LPs, etc.
   - Day 7 of HyperCVAD
   -IT chemo 2x/week, next on [**7-29**]
   -touch base with onc regarding back pain and if is expected in setting
   of IT MTX yesterday
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours

   -repeat LFTs normal
   -KUB showed large amount of stool, likely impaction
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Pain control: significant back and joint pain today in setting of
   sedation weaned.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of recent tumor lysis syndrome, who has been diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma and acromegaly. He is currently admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possible ARDS, and has failed two extubations.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation. His neurological examination shows that he is alert and oriented, with intact sensation and motor function in all four extremities.

The patient's laboratory results indicate neutropenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL and a platelet count of 24. Other lab values are within normal limits or show signs of ongoing infection and inflammation.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed, including respiratory failure, pancytopenia, hyperglycemia, distended abdomen, and joint pain. He is on multiple medications for his conditions, including antibiotics, chemotherapy agents, and pain management.

The patient's current plan includes weaning off sedation, considering tracheostomy, and continuing with aggressive treatment for Burkitt's lymphoma. Long-term plans include further evaluation for acromegaly and potential radiation therapy if"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Intermittent dysynchrony with vent, currently comfortable on AC.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -CXR this morning worse and patient reporting subjective dyspnea.
   Possibly related to IVF overload.
   -Increase PEEP to 10 for increased comfort, continue CMV on [**8-24**]
   changing for patient comfort. Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as
   tolerated but this is not a priority as patient has failed 2
   extubations and we are not planning imminent extubation in his state of
   critical illness, fever, immunocompromise, and chemotherapy.
   -Keep sedation off as long as patient as comfortable with bolus IV
   fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Start lasix gtt.
   -monitor mixed alkalosis with ABG in hopes increased PEEP will help.
   Start acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy, which was addressed with HCP
   and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He is not a
   candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as a goal
   toward the end of the week.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500).
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 dys flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 6)
   and cipro (day 9,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 2); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 5)
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -A-line grew gram positive cocci in clusters. Covered with vanc
   -resite A-line, pull IJ for line holiday with onc permission
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 7, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 6),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 5: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -f/u final BAL results, blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, CSF
   EBV PCR, serum EBV, CMV, HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Start lasix gtt
   again.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low/normal, monitor as return to normal tube feeds
   -replete K as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**]. now s/p [**3-20**] doses cyclophosphamide, cytarabine
   intrathecal x 1, s/p vincristine and doxorubicin [**7-23**], s/p intrathecal
   methotrexate
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc. Request detailed
   plan for chemo over next few weeks to plan accordingly with access,
   dexamethasone, LPs, etc.
   -touch base with onc regarding back pain and if is expected in setting
   of IT MTX yesterday
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen day 3 (hold day 10 and 11, [**7-30**] and [**7-31**])
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool for 7 days but now passing gas.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   - continue PO narcan but monitor for increased pain
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -tube feeds with free water flushes to improve hypernatremia
   -repeat LFTs normal
   -KUB showed large amount of stool, likely impaction
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Pain control: significant back and joint pain today in setting of
   sedation weaned.
   -bolus fentanyl as needed
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend). They support a
   trach if that becomes necessary/possible.
   -social work consult
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Patient subjectively comfortable this morning on PSV 8/10. Increased
   PEEP likely helps him.
   -Large amount of secretions. Lasix drip not ameliorating this. Continue
   suction.
   -Small pneumothorax on CXR: repeat to see if it is real. Consider u/s
   as it is more sensitive than CXR.  If real, consider CT to accurately
   assess size. Would like to avoid chest tube in setting of low
   platelets, neutropenia.
   -Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated but this is not a priority
   as patient has failed 2 extubations and we are not planning imminent
   extubation in his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Minimal sedation with midazolam, bolus IV fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Increased lasix gtt to
   4mg.
   -Continue acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy eventually, which was addressed
   with HCP and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He
   is not a candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as
   a goal if cannot wean ventilator.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >100F
   since [**7-24**].
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 days flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 7)
   and cipro (day 10,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 3); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 6)
   -Increase vanco dose to 1g Q8H, repeat trough in the am
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -speciation of gram + cocci from A line pending
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 8, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 7),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 6: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -f/u final blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, serum EBV, CMV,
   HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Start lasix gtt
   again.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low, replete today
   -replete K as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 8.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc.
   -Day 8 of HyperCVAD
   -IT chemo 2x/week, next on [**7-29**]
   -vincristine on [**7-31**]
   -back pain improved, attributed to LP
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen-> Stop and start it Day 12 ([**8-1**]), confirmed with onc
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **]. Repeat
   TTE normal today.
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. Stool yesterday/today after 7 days without stool.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   - stop PO narcan
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -decrease free water flushes to 100cc q6h
   -nutrition following, check recs if there is a change due to high
   residuals today
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend). They support a
   trach if that becomes necessary/possible.
   -social work following
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, acromegaly, and Burkitt lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. The patient has been intubated since July 12th and has had two failed extubations on July 15th and July 25th.

Current medical conditions:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There are ongoing efforts to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, but this is not a priority due to the patient's critical illness, fever, immunocompromise, and ongoing chemotherapy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has persistent fevers with infiltrates at the right base on chest X-ray. He is neutropenic with an ANC <500. Antibiotic therapy includes vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline.
3. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient had elevated LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia, which have since resolved to baseline. He received three doses of rasburicase and is currently stable.
4. Burkitt lymphoma: The patient is undergoing Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy, which started on July 21st. He also receives IT chemotherapy twice weekly and vincristine on July 31st.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has a precipitous drop in WBC count and is neutropenic. He has received one unit of packed red blood cells and platelet transfusions as needed. Neupogen has been started.
6. Distended abdomen: The patient has abdominal distention with hypoactive bowel sounds. Stooling has resumed after seven days without stool.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been in the 200-300s starting July 23rd, largely due to dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W, and acromegaly.
8. Acromegaly: The patient is suspected to have acromegaly based on clinical features. Further work-up is postponed until the patient is stabilized.
9. Orchitis: The patient has tender scrotal swelling with increased testicular swelling on the left, thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and generalized edema.
10. Neurologic abnormalities: The patient had initial complaints of right Bell's palsy, loss of right facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of lower extremities. MRI T-spine showed epidural enhancement of the thoracic spine, and MRI head showed a pituitary macroadenoma.
11. Joint pain: The patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and risk factors for pneumonia.
2. Line-related infections: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and a central venous catheter, which increase the risk of bloodstream infections.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts put him at risk for bleeding and infection.
4. Tumor lysis syndrome: There is a possibility of recurrence if the patient's tumor burden increases.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and fevers indicate an ongoing risk for infection.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's distended abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU, and potential medical complications can arise based on the patient's current conditions and risk factors."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Patient subjectively comfortable this morning on PSV 8/10. Increased
   PEEP likely helps him.
   -Large amount of secretions. Lasix drip not ameliorating this. Continue
   suction.
   -Small pneumothorax on CXR: repeat to see if it is real. Consider u/s
   as it is more sensitive than CXR.  If real, consider CT to accurately
   assess size. Would like to avoid chest tube in setting of low
   platelets, neutropenia.
   -Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated but this is not a priority
   as patient has failed 2 extubations and we are not planning imminent
   extubation in his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Minimal sedation with midazolam, bolus IV fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Increased lasix gtt to
   4mg.
   -Continue acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy eventually, which was addressed
   with HCP and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He
   is not a candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as
   a goal if cannot wean ventilator.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >100F
   since [**7-24**].
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 days flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 7)
   and cipro (day 10,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 3); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 6)
   -Increase vanco dose to 1g Q8H, repeat trough in the am
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -speciation of gram + cocci from A line pending
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 8, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 7),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 6: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -f/u final blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, serum EBV, CMV,
   HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Start lasix gtt
   again.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low, replete today
   -replete K as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 8.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc.
   -Day 8 of HyperCVAD
   -IT chemo 2x/week, next on [**7-29**]
   -vincristine on [**7-31**]
   -back pain improved, attributed to LP
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen-> Stop and start it Day 12 ([**8-1**]), confirmed with onc
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **]. Repeat
   TTE normal today.
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. Stool yesterday/today after 7 days without stool.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   - stop PO narcan
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -decrease free water flushes to 100cc q6h
   -nutrition following, check recs if there is a change due to high
   residuals today
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend). They support a
   trach if that becomes necessary/possible.
   -social work following
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a recent history of tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on 7-21 for Burkitt lymphoma. He also has a new diagnosis of acromegaly. The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, possible ARDS. He has been intubated since 7-12 and has experienced two failed extubations on 7-15 and 7-25. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 133/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination reveals acromegalic features, diffuse petechiae, and diminished testicular swelling. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 15 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.7 mmol/L. Other notable labs include elevated levels of LDH, CK, troponin-T, and D-dimer. 

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, pancytopenia, hyperglycemia, distended abdomen, and tachycardia. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing the chemotherapeutic regimen of HyperCVAD, stopping Neupogen and starting it on day 12, increasing vancomycin dose to 1g q8h, and following up with tumor lysis syndrome labs. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to neutropenia, further drops in WBC and platelet counts, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia related to tumor lysis syndrome."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old individual with a history of lymphoma who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient is on day 8 of HyperCVAD chemotherapy and has been experiencing febrile neutropenia. They have GPC bacteremia and are being treated with antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/69 mmHg to 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 1020 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37, oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 185 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 23 mEq/L. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels of 0.3 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium (Na+) level of 108 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium (K+) level of 5.1 mEq/L, and hypocalcemia with a calcium (Ca++) level of 7.6 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), as well as a low international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient's assessment includes impaired skin integrity, fever, hypotension, acute renal failure, lymphoma, acute respiratory failure, tachycardia, and other conditions. The patient is receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding, and their lines include a central venous catheter and an arterial line. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of renal function, infection (due to immunosuppression and presence of fever), respiratory complications related to mechanical ventilation, bleeding due to coagulopathy, and further deterioration of skin integrity."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   -Patient on PSV 8/10, reporting intermittent dyspnea. Increased PEEP
   likely helps him. Wean PEEP and pressure as tolerated, Long SBT when he
   reaches [**5-19**] comfortably. However, we will use caution due to 2 failed
   extubations and his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Minimal sedation with midazolam, bolus IV fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least >100cc/hr with lasix gtt.
   -Stop acetazolamide
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy eventually, which was addressed
   with HCP and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He
   is not a candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as
   a goal if cannot wean ventilator.
   Pneumonia/Infection: persistent infiltrates at R base on CXR.  WBC
   elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting of chemotherapy.
   Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >101F since [**7-24**].
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 days flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 8)
   and cipro (day 9,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 4); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 7)
   -Repeat vanco trough again tomorrow morning. Will increase dosing if
   <15.
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -IJ catheter trip grew coag neg staph on [**7-27**], covered by vanc
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 9, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 8),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 7: d/ced Bactrim)
   -G6PD normal, switch to dapsone if oncology approves
   -f/u final blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, serum EBV, CMV,
   HHV-6 PCR
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. They have been stable for
   several days.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr with lasix gtt
   -continue allopurinol
   -replete K and phos as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 9.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc.
   -IT chemo today
   -vincristine on [**7-31**]
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   -touch base with onc regarding neuroimaging to see if there was a
   response to therapy. This can also help evaluate his LE weakness.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -transfuse PRBCs if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen-> Stopped, will start it Day 12 ([**8-1**]), confirmed with onc
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **]. Repeat
   TTE normal today.
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. Stool yesterday after 7 days without stool. No stool in past 24
   hours
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   - add PO narcan again, 6mg PO TID
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -free water flushes to 100cc q6h
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL.
   -Likely will switch to drip again when start dex on [**7-31**]
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**],
   his lower extremity weakness has been constant and severe
 patient can
   wiggle his toes but nothing else. Reflexes depressed bilaterally.
   Neutral Babinskis.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary urgently. [**Month (only) 11**] consider for response to treatment,
   explanation for LE weakness
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam when extubated, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, recently started chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma, and a new diagnosis of acromegaly. He has been in the ICU since 7/12 with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient's presenting complaints include Bell's palsy, urinary retention, lower extremity weakness, and dyspnea. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition shows that he is alert and opens eyes to voice, follows commands, and nods appropriately. He has acromegalic features and no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. His neck is supple, and there are no lymphadenopathies appreciated. His cardiac examination reveals normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung auscultation shows CTAB (consolidation at the right base), and his abdomen is mildly distended with diffuse tenderness. He has somewhat diminished testicular swelling without heat or redness. There are small bullae on the testicle. His extremities show 2+ dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and radial pulses, along with 3+ pitting edema. His skin examination reveals diffuse petechiae, and he has a tattoo on his right forearm.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following:
- WBC: 0.1 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
- Platelets: 15 K/uL
- Sodium: 138 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.5 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 0.3 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 149 mg/dL
- Amylase: 39 IU/L
- Lipase: 132 IU/L
- PT/INR: 13.9/1.2
- PTT: 29.4 seconds
- Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
- Albumin: 2.6 g/dL

- Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.8 mg/dL
- D-dimer: 2552 ng/mL
- Fibrinogen: 668 mg/dL

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS, neutropenic fever, pancytopenia, hyperglycemia, distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, and tachycardia. He also has a history of acromegaly and is suspected to have orchitis secondary to malignant infiltration and generalized edema. The patient's neurological abnormalities include Bell's palsy, loss of right facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of lower extremities, and neutral Babinski signs.

Based on the patient's condition and the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, further deterioration of pancytopenia, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal complications due to distended abdomen, and cardiac issues related to tachycardia. Additionally, the patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for any changes in his weakness and sensory deficits."

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, possible ARDS. Original
   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Contributing factors to respiratory status include PNA and suspicion
   for infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as meeting ARDS
   criteria starting [**7-18**]. However, compliance has remained normal so
   tolerating large tidal volumes on PSV.
   -Patient subjectively comfortable this morning on PSV 8/10. Increased
   PEEP likely helps him.
   -Large amount of secretions. Lasix drip not ameliorating this. Continue
   suction.
   -Small pneumothorax on CXR: repeat to see if it is real. Consider u/s
   as it is more sensitive than CXR.  If real, consider CT to accurately
   assess size. Would like to avoid chest tube in setting of low
   platelets, neutropenia.
   -Consider weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated but this is not a priority
   as patient has failed 2 extubations and we are not planning imminent
   extubation in his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Minimal sedation with midazolam, bolus IV fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least 100-200cc/hr. Increased lasix gtt to
   4mg.
   -Continue acetazolamide and give K+ to help with metabolic portion of
   alkalosis
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy eventually, which was addressed
   with HCP and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He
   is not a candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as
   a goal if cannot wean ventilator.
   Pneumonia/Infection: ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at R
   base on CXR. WBC elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting
   of chemotherapy. Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >100F
   since [**7-24**].
   -s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days meropenem (d/c
ed 3
   [**7-24**]), 2 days flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 7)
   and cipro (day 10,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 3); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 6)
   -Increase vanco dose to 1g Q8H, repeat trough in the am
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**] positive for coag+ staph, repeat sputum pending,
   covered by vanc
   -speciation of gram + cocci from A line pending
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 8, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 7),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 6: d/ced Bactrim)
   -check G6PD if negative, will switch atovaquone to dapsone for better
   efficacy
   -f/u final blood cx, CSF fungal, AFB, and viral cx, serum EBV, CMV,
   HHV-6 PCR, and galactomannan and B-glucan
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. Today they are relatively
   stable.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -keep UOP at least 100cc/hr; currently autodiuresing. Start lasix gtt
   again.
   -continue allopurinol
   -phos low, replete today
   -replete K as needed
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 8.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc.
   -Day 8 of HyperCVAD
   -IT chemo 2x/week, next on [**7-29**]
   -vincristine on [**7-31**]
   -back pain improved, attributed to LP
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -s/p 1 units of PRBC over last 24 hours
   -transfuse again if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets if needed (<15)
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen-> Stop and start it Day 12 ([**8-1**]), confirmed with onc
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **]. Repeat
   TTE normal today.
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. Stool yesterday/today after 7 days without stool.
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   - stop PO narcan
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -decrease free water flushes to 100cc q6h
   -nutrition following, check recs if there is a change due to high
   residuals today
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL. Switch to drip if needed
   Social:
   -in touch with family as well as HCP [**Name (NI) 1068**] (friend). They support a
   trach if that becomes necessary/possible.
   -social work following
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary.
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam as we wean sedation, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

- The patient is a 40-year-old male with a recent history of tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on 7/21 for Burkitt's lymphoma, and a new diagnosis of acromegaly.
- The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. He is intubated since 7/12 and has experienced two failed extubations.
- The patient has a large amount of secretions, and a small pneumothorax is present on chest X-ray. There is a suspicion of an infiltrative malignant process on CT, as well as potential lung involvement by the lymphoma.
- The patient has ongoing fevers with persistent infiltrates at the right base on chest X-ray. Blood cultures have shown growth of coag+ staph, and coverage with vancomycin has been initiated.
- The patient's tumor lysis syndrome labs are relatively stable, but they are being closely monitored. The patient has received three doses of rasburicase to manage this condition.
- The patient's Burkitt's lymphoma is diffuse and involves the stomach, ureters, and lymphatic spread. He is currently on day 8 of Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and will continue with this regimen.
- The patient has pancytopenia with a precipitous drop in WBC count following chemotherapy, as well as low platelet counts. He"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, lymphoma, possible ARDS.
   Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and
   lower extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   -Patient on PSV 8/8 since yesterday am, reporting feels comfortable on
   these settings. Wean PEEP and pressure as tolerated, Long SBT when he
   reaches [**5-19**] comfortably. However, we will use caution due to 2 failed
   extubations and his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.
   -Minimal sedation with midazolam, bolus IV fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least >100cc/hr with lasix gtt.
   -follow ABGs when changes in ventilator settings or respiratory status
   (Goal is ph>7.20, C02<70)
   -Daily CXR
   -patient will likely need tracheostomy eventually, which was addressed
   with HCP and family over the weekend and they support it if needed. He
   is not a candidate now given fevers, low platelets, but keep in mind as
   a goal if cannot wean ventilator.
   Pneumonia/Infection: persistent infiltrates at R base on CXR.  WBC
   elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting of chemotherapy.
   Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >101F since [**7-24**].

   started on [**7-21**], now day 9.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -IT chemo today if can increase platelet count to >100 with HLA-matched
   platelets
   -vincristine tomorrow ([**7-31**])
   -onc waiting on any further neuroimaging until chemo course is finished
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   -touch base with onc regarding neuroimaging to see if there was a
   response to therapy. This can also help evaluate his LE weakness.
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  Neutropenic fever today
   -transfuse PRBCs if needed (Hct<21)
   -give platelets with goal of >100 for chemo (try HLA-matched), blood

   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **]. Repeat
   TTE normal today.
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline

   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**],
   his lower extremity weakness has been constant and severe
 patient can
   wiggle his toes but nothing else. Reflexes depressed bilaterally.
   Neutral Babinskis.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary urgently. [**Month (only) 11**] consider for response to treatment,
   explanation for LE weakness
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam when extubated, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on 7/21 for Burkitt's lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis, and possible ARDS. The patient also has acromegaly, pancytopenia, tachycardia, abdominal distention, hyperglycemia, orchitis, neurologic abnormalities, joint pain, and is awaiting tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. Monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation levels, as well as adjusting ventilator settings, will be crucial in managing this condition.
2. Pneumonia/Infection: The patient has persistent infiltrates at the right base on CXR. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and further investigations such as sputum culture and sensitivity tests may be necessary to identify the causative organism.
3. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's tumor lysis syndrome has resolved but requires ongoing monitoring of renal function, electrolyte levels, and uric acid levels. Allopurinol and rasburicase should be continued to prevent hyperuricemia.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. Close monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and"

   presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and lower
   extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   -Patient on PSV 8/10, reporting intermittent dyspnea. Increased PEEP
   likely helps him. Wean PEEP and pressure as tolerated, Long SBT when he
   reaches [**5-19**] comfortably. However, we will use caution due to 2 failed
   extubations and his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise,
   and chemotherapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a recent history of tumor lysis syndrome, currently undergoing chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma. He is also diagnosed with acromegaly and has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible ARDS. The patient has been intubated since July 12th and has had two failed extubations.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/45-151/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, famotidine, and other medications as per oncology consultation.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of potassium, phosphorus, and uric acid. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level. Other lab results indicate possible infection, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin levels.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, pancytopenia, tumor lysis syndrome, and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has a history of Bell's palsy, urinary retention, and lower extrem"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, lymphoma, possible ARDS.
   Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and
   lower extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated since [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on
   [**7-15**] secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   -Patient on PSV 8/8, reporting feels comfortable on these settings.
   Wean PEEP and pressure as tolerated, Long SBT when he reaches [**5-19**]
   comfortably. However, we will use caution due to 2 failed extubations
   and his state of critical illness, fever, immunocompromise, and
   chemotherapy.
   -Minimal sedation with midazolam, bolus IV fentanyl for pain control.
   -Continue autodiuresis to at least >100cc/hr with lasix gtt, increase
   to 4 this morning.
   -Consider increasing midazolam a little as move toward extubation.
   -follow ABGs as wean pressure support
   -CXR today
   Pneumonia/Infection: persistent infiltrates at R base on CXR.  WBC
   elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting of chemotherapy.
   Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >101F since [**7-24**].

   -Pneumonia, presumed mycoplasma hominis: doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 9)
   and cipro (day 10,start [**7-19**]). Check with ID on the length of this
   course.
   -Neutropenic, febrile: vanco started again (day 5); cefepime 2gm IV q8h
   (day 8)
   -Vanco trough 15.1 this am. Continue current dose.
   -Sputum cx from [**7-23**]  and [**7-27**] positive for coag+ staph, covered by vanc
   -IJ catheter trip grew coag neg staph on [**7-27**], covered by vanc
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 10, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 9),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 8)
   -G6PD normal, however not switching to dapsone given its bone marrow
   effects
   -f/u blood cx, serum EBV, HHV-6 PCR
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. They have been stable for
   several days.

s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 10.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -talk to onc regarding IT chemo today: cannot get platelets over 50 per
   blood bank, suggest giving 2 bags back to back, check platelets
   immediately, then followed by LP immediately
   -vincristine tomorrow ([**7-31**])
   -onc waiting on any further neuroimaging until chemo course is finished
   -gadolinium-enhanced head MRI when patient stabilized to investigate
   extent of lymphoma and possible need for radiation to head. This is
   only necessary if medical treatment fails and is not an urgent issue.
   -onc wants to hold off on neuroimaging until he has completed this
   course of chemo
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  ANC today is zero.
   -transfuse PRBCs this morning for Hct < 21
   -resolve platelet issue with onc and blood bank. Other than setting of
   LP, keep platelets >15.
   -CBC Q8H
   -neupogen-> Stopped, will start it Day 12 ([**8-1**]), confirmed with onc
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **]. Repeat
   TTE normal today.
   -maximize comfort on ventilator
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 50mg q6h
   Distended abdomen: abdominal distention is stable with hypoactive bowel
   sounds. No stool in past 48 hours
   -KUB today
   -Colace, senna, dulcolax, and lactulose
   -PO narcan 6mg PO TID, increase dose
   -Try to wean fentanyl as possible
   -free water flushes to 100cc q6h
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL.
   -Likely will switch to drip again when start dex on [**7-31**]
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**],
   his lower extremity weakness has been constant and severe
 patient can
   wiggle his toes but nothing else. Reflexes depressed bilaterally.
   Neutral Babinskis.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary urgently. [**Month (only) 11**] consider for response to treatment,
   explanation for LE weakness
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam when extubated, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -avoiding NSAIDs
   -tylenol when awake
   -continue pain control with fentanyl

   40M with recent h/o tumor lysis syndrome, started chemotherapy on [**7-21**]
   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, lymphoma, possible ARDS.
   Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and
   lower extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated on [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Extubated for 3^rd time on, [**7-30**]. This morning weaned from 50% 02 by
   shovel mask down to room air and reporting no dyspnea. Frequent suction
   needed, much of which patient can do himself. Pt continues to be on
   room air.
   -Transition from lasix gtt to 40 IV BID bolus. Minimum UOP 100 cc/hr.
   -Suction as needed
   -Wean 02 as tolerated
   -ABGs if change in respiratory status
   Pneumonia/Infection: persistent infiltrates at R base on CXR.  WBC
   elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting of chemotherapy.
   Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >101F since [**7-24**].
   Today he is afebrile. s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days
   meropenem (d/c
ed 3 [**7-24**]), 2 days flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Failed speech/[**Last Name (LF) 2626**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will change atovaquone to bactrim IV today
   -Mycoplasma hominis:  continue doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 10) and cipro
   (day 11,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenia, coag neg staph grown from A line ([**7-25**]), IJ tip ([**7-27**]):
   vanco started again (day 6); cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 9)
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 11, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 10),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 9)
   -f/u blood cx
   -Touch base with ID: for treatment length for mycoplasm, plan for
   neutropenia going forward and what to do with vanc and cefipime. Vanc
   is for neutropenia as well as coag neg staph from blood. [**Month (only) 11**] consider
   peeling back cipro vs cefepime first but ID will touch base with us
   about this. Additionally, in the future may consider another echo due
   to the bacteremia.
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. They have been stable for
   several days.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -UOP > 100cc/hr with lasix gtt
   -d/c allopurinol until PO access -> inform onc about this
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 11. Had vincristine/dex w/o complications on
   [**7-31**]
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -onc deferred LP yesterday due to low platelets. f/u regarding IT chemo
   plans for future
   -waiting on any further neuroimaging until chemo course is finished
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.
   -CBC Q8H
   -transfuse PRBCs for keeping Hct > 25
   -give platelets as needed to keep platelets >15
   -f/u HLA labs in case HLA matched platelets needed in future
   -neupogen-> Stopped, will start it Day 12 ([**8-1**])
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   GI/Distended abdomen: abdominal distention with minimal BS and little
   stool over last 2 weeks. Yesterday/last night stool x2.  Repeat KUB
   showed possible impaction, no obstruction. Currently he is NPO with no
   NGT/OGT.
   -failed bedside speech and [**Month/Year (2) 2626**] consult, will repeat on Monday
   -encourage sitting up, possibly in a chair to work toward being able to
   take PO
   -When he can take PO, restart Colace, senna, dulcolax, lactulose, PO
   narcan
   - SC methylnaltrexone if needed for constipation
   -wean narcotics as possible
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6H
   FEN: Alkalotic in setting of large amount of diuresis due to lasix gtt.
   -Stay current with KCl repletion
   -Check pH again later today
   -Wean lasix if patient can adequately autodiurese
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL.
   - Resumed dex for chemo on [**7-31**], but FSBG well controlled, can switch
   to drip or increase ISS if necessary.
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -pain control with morphine, tylenol PRN
   PT: f/u recs
   .
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:

   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**],
   his lower extremity weakness has been constant and severe
 patient can
   wiggle his toes but nothing else. Reflexes depressed bilaterally.
   Neutral Babinskis.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary urgently. [**Month (only) 11**] consider for response to treatment,
   explanation for LE weakness
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam when extubated, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of tumor lysis syndrome, acute respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia, lymphoma, and possible ARDS. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has persistent infiltrates at the right base on CXR, indicating an ongoing respiratory infection. This increases the risk of pneumonia and potential worsening of respiratory status.

2. Infection: The patient has been neutropenic (ANC < 500) due to chemotherapy, making him susceptible to infections. Coag-negative staph bacteremia has already been identified, and there is a concern for further infections.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of tumor lysis syndrome and acute renal failure. His current renal function should be closely monitored, and further complications related to renal dysfunction may occur.

4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

5. Tumor lysis syndrome: Although the patient received rasburicase and his labs showed improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent tumor lysis syndrome, especially if chemotherapy-induced cytopenias occur again.

6. Acromegaly: The patient has a new presumptive diagnosis of"

   for Burkitt
s lymphoma. New diagnosis of acromegaly, in ICU with
   respiratory failure in setting of pneumonia, lymphoma, possible ARDS.
   Original presenting complaint was Bell
s Palsy, urinary retention, and
   lower extremity weakness.
   Respiratory failure: intubated on [**7-12**], s/p 2 failed extubations on [**7-15**]
   secondary to copious secretions and [**7-25**] due to work of breathing.
   Extubated for 3^rd time on, [**7-30**]. This morning weaned from 50% 02 by
   shovel mask down to room air and reporting no dyspnea. Frequent suction
   needed, much of which patient can do himself. Pt continues to be on
   room air.
   -Continue diuresis with lasix gtt. Minimum UOP 100 cc/hr.
   -Suction as needed
   -Wean 02 as tolerated
   -CXR tomorrow
   -ABGs if change in respiratory status
   Pneumonia/Infection: persistent infiltrates at R base on CXR.  WBC
   elevated on [**7-18**], now precipitously dropped in setting of chemotherapy.
   Patient is now neutropenic (ANC<<500). No fevers >101F since [**7-24**].
   Today he is afebrile. s/p 10day course Vanco (d/ced [**7-24**]) and 3 days
   meropenem (d/c
ed 3 [**7-24**]), 2 days flaygl (d/ced [**7-25**])
   -Failed speech/[**Last Name (LF) 2626**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will change atovaquone to bactrim IV today
   -Mycoplasma hominis:  continue doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] (day 10) and cipro
   (day 11,start [**7-19**]).
   -Neutropenia, coag neg staph grown from A line ([**7-25**]), IJ tip ([**7-27**]):
   vanco started again (day 6); cefepime 2gm IV q8h (day 9)
   -prophylaxis with fluconazole (day 11, start [**7-21**]), acyclovir (day 10),
   atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**] (day 9)
   -f/u blood cx
   -Touch base with ID: for treatment length for mycoplasm, plan for
   neutropenia going forward and what to do with vanc and cefipime. Vanc
   is for neutropenia as well as coag neg staph from blood. [**Month (only) 11**] consider
   peeling back cipro vs cefepime first but ID will touch base with us
   about this. Additionally, in the future may consider another echo due
   to the bacteremia.
   Tumor lysis syndrome: Labs at admission were significant for elevated
   LDH, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia which all resolved
   to baseline. Patient s/p 3 doses rasburicase, last dose 7/10. Tumor
   lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**]. They have been stable for
   several days.
   -f/u tumor lysis labs Q8H
   -UOP > 100cc/hr with lasix gtt
   -d/c allopurinol until PO access -> inform onc about this
   Burkitt
s lymphoma: CT shows diffuse evidence of malignancy - c/w
   lymphangitic spread of diffuse malignant process, thickening in
   stomach, ureters. Bone marrow bx c/w Burkitt
s lymphoma. Hyper-CVAD
   started on [**7-21**], now day 11.
   -continue chemotherapeutic regimen as outlined by onc
   -vincristine today ([**7-31**])
   -onc deferred LP yesterday due to low platelets. f/u regarding IT chemo
   plans for future
   -waiting on any further neuroimaging until chemo course is finished
   Pancytopenia: Platelets following throughout this admission,
   precipitous drop in WBC on day 1 of chemo, Hct in low 20s throughout
   most of admission.  ANC today is 0.
   -CBC Q8H\
   -transfuse PRBCs for keeping Hct > 25
   -give platelets as needed to keep platelets >15
   -f/u HLA labs in case HLA matched platelets needed in future
   -neupogen-> Stopped, will start it Day 12 ([**8-1**])
   -DIC labs Q24H, per onc
   -neutropenic precautions
   GI/Distended abdomen: abdominal distention with minimal BS and little
   stool over last 2 weeks. Yesterday/last night stool x2.  Repeat KUB
   showed possible impaction, no obstruction. Currently he is NPO with no
   NGT/OGT.
   -failed bedside speech and [**Month/Year (2) 2626**] consult, will repeat on Monday
   -encourage sitting up, possibly in a chair to work toward being able to
   take PO
   -When he can take PO, restart Colace, senna, dulcolax, lactulose, PO
   narcan
   - SC methylnaltrexone if needed for constipation
   -wean narcotics as possible
   Tachycardia: Consistently tachycardic to 110s/120s. TSH WNL, TTE showed
   normal EF and no evidence of heart failure. Repeat EKGs have shown
   frequent PVCs, no signs of myocardial ischemia. Likely physiologic
   tachycardia secondary to infection, lymphoma, anemia, high [**Hospital1 **].
   -EKG on [**7-23**] at baseline
   -continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6H
   FEN: Alkalotic in setting of large amount of diuresis due to lasix gtt.
   -Stay current with KCl repletion
   -Check pH again later today
   -Wean lasix if patient can adequately autodiurese
   Hyperglycemia: blood glucose in the 200- 300s starting [**7-23**] largely due
   to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
   -on ISS with goal BG 100-150mg/dL.
   - Resumed dex for chemo on [**7-31**], but FSBG well controlled, can switch
   to drip if necessary.
   Joint pain: Patient has severe and diffuse arthralgias, most likely
   secondary to hypertrophic arthropathy from acromegaly.
   -pain control with morphine, tylenol PRN
   The following issues are not acute or active but left on the note to be
   followed up on when Mr. [**Known lastname 7019**] is awake and stabilized:
   Acromegaly: New presumptive diagnosis based on clinical features.
   Definitive work-up postponed until patient stabilized.
   -f/u with endocrine
   -f/u endocrine labs (IGFBP, Vit D)
   -ophtho consult for visual fields when patient extubated/alert
   Orchitis:  Tender scrotal swelling on admission, scrotal US suggested
   epididymitis/orchitis. No clear masses. G&C swab negative. Exam
   starting [**7-17**] shows marked increase in testicular swelling, particularly
   on the left. Thought to be secondary to malignant infiltration and
   generalized edema.
   -f/u when patient stabilized, likely due to lymphoma
   Neurologic abnormalities: Initial patient complaints included R Bell
   palsy, loss of R facial sensation, weakness/decreased sensation of
   lower extremities. MRI T-spine at OSH showed epidural enhancement of
   thoracic spine; MRI head showed pituitary macroadenoma. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**],
   his lower extremity weakness has been constant and severe
 patient can
   wiggle his toes but nothing else. Reflexes depressed bilaterally.
   Neutral Babinskis.
   -neurosurgery has low suspicion for cord compression and repeat MRI of
   spine not necessary urgently. [**Month (only) 11**] consider for response to treatment,
   explanation for LE weakness
   -Repeat MRI of pituitary eventually needed although in light of recent
   ARF, this is not a priority and can wait until patient stabilized.
   -better neuro exam when extubated, particularly focused on cranial
   nerve
s V and VII and lower extremity sensation/motor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of Burkitt's Lymphoma, who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to multifocal pneumonia and lymphomatous infiltration of the airways. The patient has been extubated and is now maintained on room air. The respiratory status has improved, and the patient continues to be monitored for potential complications such as tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia and lymphomatous infiltration of the airways. Close monitoring of respiratory status is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient may experience tumor lysis syndrome due to chemotherapy treatment for Burkitt's Lymphoma. Monitoring of laboratory values, particularly potassium and calcium levels, is important to prevent complications associated with tumor lysis syndrome.
3. Neutropenia: The patient is neutropenic, which increases the risk of infection. Continued administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary to prevent and treat any potential infections.
4. Renal Failure: The patient may be at risk for acute renal failure, particularly due to tumor lysis syndrome. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid balance and medication adjustments, is necessary.
5. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has a documented fever, which needs to be evaluated further to determine the"
