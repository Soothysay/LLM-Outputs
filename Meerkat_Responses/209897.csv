","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypotension, urinary tract infection (UTI), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm with AF, blood pressure ranging from 95/57 mmHg to 103/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics to cover for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and contact precautions for MRSA, VRE, and [Name (NI) 7012] due to prior pneumonia.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL, normal glucose levels at 91 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine levels at 5.3 mg/dL indicating renal impairment. Coagulation studies reveal an elevated PT/INR and PTT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction suggests an ongoing infection. It is important to continue aggressive management of the infection through appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control measures.

2. Atrial Fibrillation"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile colitis, previous klebsiella urosepsis, and a recent MRSA line infection. The patient presented with generalized weakness and low blood pressure.

Assessment and plan:
1. Fatigue/hypotension/leukocytosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for infection, with suspicious urine for urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood cultures from hemodialysis this week show negative growth (NGTD). The patient is afebrile and responded to normal saline (NS) in the emergency department. A more prominent gallbladder was noted on computed tomography (CT) scan, but the abdominal exam was benign. The hemodialysis line site does not appear suspicious for infection.
- Vancomycin (Vanc) was started on Thursday and will be continued with a higher dose for hemodialysis.
- Follow-up blood cultures and urine culture are required.
- Check for Clostridium difficile infection.
- Careful intravenous fluid management for mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

2. ESRD/HD: Appreciate renal recs and will continue to follow, most likely dialysis for Monday.
- Notify Dr. [Last Name (Title)]"

   add the following points:  81 yo man with h/o AFIb, ESRD on HD,
   diastolic HF, prior CVAs, prior c diff inf, prior bouts of urosepsis
   and line infections with MRSA and [**Year (4 digits) 7012**] E. coli, admitted overnight
   with septic picture
weakness, HOTN, leukocytosis.  BP responded to
   IVF.  Has UTI by U/A.  CXR with low lung volumes but no obvious pna.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile colitis, previous klebsiella urosepsis, and a recent MRSA line infection. He presented with generalized weakness, low blood pressure, and leukocytosis. His urine culture is suspicious for urinary tract infection (UTI). He has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and a previous cerebrovascular accident. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fatigue/hypotension/leukocytosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for infection. Urine is suspicious for UTI. Blood pressure responded to normal saline (NS) in the emergency department. A CT scan shows a more prominent gallbladder but a benign abdominal exam. The hemodialysis line site does not appear to be infected.
- Vancomycin (Vanc) was started on Thursday. The patient will be covered with Vanc (hemodialysis dosed) and meropenem.
- Follow-up blood cultures and urine cultures will be sent.
- Check C. difficile status.
- Careful intravenous fluid management for mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

2. ESRD/HD:
- Continue renal recommendations.
- Most likely dialysis for Monday.
- Notify Dr. [Last Name (Title) 7009] regarding plan for fistula next week, which may need to be deferred.

3. Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia:
- Likely from insensible losses combined with poor oral intake.
- Continue normal saline (NS) boluses as needed for hypotension.
- Check electrolytes at [Hospital1].

4. Sleep apnea:
- Continue night oxygen and increase nasal cannula at night.

5. h/o CAD/PVD/CVA:
- Continue aspirin 325 mg.

6. h/o Afib: Currently in AFib but rate controlled.
- Beta-blocker recently discontinued due to hypotension.

7. h/o? dCHF:
- Currently does not appear volume overloaded.

8. Anemia h/o GIB:
- HCT greater than baseline.
- Guaiac stool per rectum (prn).

9. Prophylaxis: sc heparin tid; PPI.

10. FEN: renal diet.

11. Access: PIV, HD line.

12. Code: Full Code, confirmed with the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction due to UTI and possible line infection.
2. Hypotension not in shock.
3. Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD).
4. Hyponatremia.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF).
6. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff).
7. Line infection with MRSA and [Year (4 digits) 7012] E. coli.
8. Sleep apnea.
9. History of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
10. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rate control.
11. Anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
12. Possible stress ulcer and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient continues to be hypotensive despite fluid boluses and failed central venous line placement. An arterial line was successfully placed on the right radial artery. Renal replacement therapy is scheduled for tomorrow and Tuesday. The patient was significantly agitated overnight and received zyprexa and haldol with no improvement, resulting in the use of soft restraints. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are documented.

24-hour events include the start of an arterial line, administration of meropenem, and initiation of heparin sodium prophylaxis. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for new findings. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device.

Physical examination findings include atrial fibrillation and unassessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and abdominal assessments. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present with low potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels.

Assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, delirium/confusion, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, urinary tract infection, and end-stage renal disease.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile colitis, and a previous MRSA line infection. He presented with generalized weakness and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including GN bacteremia, suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, AFib, and a history of hypotension, UTI, and ESRD. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a suspected UTI and GN bacteremia. There is also a concern for a potential line infection due to the recent MRSA line infection history. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem to cover for different types of bacteria.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite fluid boluses, indicating possible persistent low blood pressure.
3. Hyponatremia/Hypochloremia: The patient has hyponatremia and hypochloremia, likely due to insensible losses and poor oral intake. This needs to be addressed through careful management of electrolytes and fluid balance.
4. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of sleep apnea, and measures such as night oxygen and increased nasal continuous positive air"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile colitis, and previous klebsiella urosepsis. He presented with generalized weakness and low blood pressure. The patient's arterial line failed and a new radial arterial line was placed. He has been receiving fluid boluses, but continues to be hypotensive. The patient was agitated overnight and received Zyprexa and Haldol without success, requiring soft restraints. This morning, he was cooperative and restraints were removed. He is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, meropenem, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 108/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for noted below. The patient's flow sheet data includes fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and other relevant information. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactic acid, among other abnormalities. The patient's assessment includes generalized weakness, low blood pressure, potential infection, and distended gallbladder on CT. The plan includes continuing vancomycin and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile colitis (C. diff), and a previous MRSA line infection. He presented with generalized weakness and low blood pressure. The patient has bacteremia with Gram-negative rods (GNR), suspicious urine for urinary tract infection (UTI), and a distended gallbladder on computed tomography (CT) scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation is concerning for infection, and there are several potential sources including the gallbladder and hemodialysis (HD) line. The blood cultures are growing GNRs, which may indicate a urinary tract infection or another source of infection. The patient is already receiving antibiotics, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.

2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has hyponatremia and hypochloremia, likely due to insensible losses combined with poor oral intake and dialysis. Close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances are essential.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is not assessed in the progress note, but delirium or confusion could be a possibility given his age, multiple comorbidities, and recent hospitalizations.
