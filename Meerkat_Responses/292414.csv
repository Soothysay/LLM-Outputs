   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxemia.  Multifactorial with major
   contribution of volume overload/pulmonary edema plus left sided
   consolidation (which may be asymmetric edema vs. pneumonia/infectious
   consolidation; also may be layering effusion).  Also may have component
   of COPD flare/reactive airways, though no current wheezing on exam.
   Consider PE given tachycardia and immobility.  Also with some
   restrictive component with large abdomen/ascites.Does not appear
   particularly distressed at the moment and O2 sats >95% on nasal
   cannula.  However, ABG with elevated pCO2.  Refusing intubation and
   BiPap.
   - Remove volume - start lasix gtt (goal negative as much as BP
   tolerates); consideration for HD as early as today.
   - Will discuss with renal and/or IR re: line placement for possible HD,
   ?timing.
   - TTE.
   - Continue antibiotics for HAP - vanc and zosyn; attempt sputum
   sample.  Consider bronch to further evaluate left side if persists
   after diuresis.
   - Paracentesis - therapeutic.
   - Nebs ATC and prn for wheezing.
   - Retry bipap if will tolerate.
   - Lower delivered O2 to achieve goal sat 90-93%.
   # Anasarca.  Patient with RV, ?LV failure, cirrhosis, worsening renal
   failure.  Needs volume removal via diuresis or HD.
   - f/u renal recs as above.
   - lasix gtt.
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease.
   - Redose digoxin today.
   - COntinue PO metoprolol QID.
   - will eval for VTE with TTE and LENIs and UENI, consider further eval
   if suspicion for PE still exists.
   - Hold coumadin for now given planned procedures.
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - UA and lytes.
   - Consider renal ultrasound.
   - renal to see.
   # Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Refuses bipap and
   intubation.  COPD vs. mental status.  Unclear if Co2 retention also
   contributing to mental status.
   - Nebs ATC, consider steroids if more evidence of wheezing.
   - Improve mental status with lactulose/rifaximin and ?dialysis.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin.
   - ?dialysis
   - NGT if not safely taking PO.
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure without known status
   of LV.  Has signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - diuresis as above.
   - continue BB and digoxin.
   - TTE.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - f/u OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose.
   - LVP for comfort, rule out infection.
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - Discussion re: timing of GI workup and risks/benefits of
   anticoagulating.
   # Leg edema/rash. ?hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.  Unclear how much
   infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good granulation tissue,
   no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care consult.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, and cirrhosis of the liver.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 131 bpm (with a range of 104-138 bpm), blood pressure of 89/57 mmHg (with a range of 66-108/74-82 mmHg), respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (with a range of 5-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), lactic acid, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). The patient's albumin level is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals peripheral vascular issues, impaired skin integrity, and an inability to assess other vital signs such as pulse oximetry due to the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, chronic renal failure,"

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes.
   .
   # Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Unclear baseline - to what
   degree acidemia is due to acute hypoventilation vs. worsening of
   metabolic acidosis.  Patient likely hypoventilating at least in part
   due to reduced lung volumes due to worsening ascites.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   worsened by improved O2 sats.  Otherwise, acute component may be due to
   COPD vs. altered mental status.  Refuses bipap and intubation.  Unclear
   if Co2 retention also contributing to mental status.
   - A line placed, follow serial ABGs.
   - Will do therapeutic paracentesis today, which should allow larger
   lung volumes.
   - Nebs prn to reduce obstructive component.
   - Improve mental status with lactulose/rifaximin
   - Aim for O2 sats in the 90 to 92 range.
   .
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxemia.  Improved this morning as hypoxemia
   seems to have improved, though the patient seems to need to remain
   sitting up.  Hypoxemia likely mostly volume overload/pulmonary edema
   plus left sided consolidation (which may be asymmetric edema vs.
   pneumonia/infectious consolidation; also may be layering effusion).  We
   were unsuccessful in removing fluid with a lasix drip, and needs line
   placement to begin CVVH and fluid removal.  He is in a very tenuous
   position for lying flat and having the line placed by IR, especially
   given his wish to not be intubated.  We would prefer bed-side placement
   of a temporary catheter to improve his respiratory status before a more
   permanent tunneled line is placed by IR.
   - Bedside dialysis line placement by our team or renal.  Will need FFP
   prior to procedure.
   - Continue to hold off on antibiotics except for cipro as below.
   - Therapeutic paracentesis today.
   - Nebs prn for wheezing.
   - Retry bipap if will tolerate.
   - Lower delivered O2 to achieve goal sat 90-93%.
   .
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease.
   - As has only received single dose of digoxin recently, will half-load
   with 0.5 mg IV x 1 now.
   - Patient is struggling to take all of his pills PO (can take limited
   amount) so we can give lopressor IV if unable to take PO dose.
   - Hold coumadin for now given planned procedures.  Will need FFP prior
   to line placement.
   .
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 2.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - initiation of HD; f/u renal recs.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin.
   - dialysis
   - NGT if not safely taking PO and patient amenable.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - diuresis as above.
   - continue BB and digoxin.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose.
   - LVP for comfort, rule out infection.
   .
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   .
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider NG tube placement until mental status
   hopefully improves with dialysis.  Need to discuss with patient.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, peripherals

   [**Name2 (NI) **]osition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, alcoholic cirrhosis, anemia, leg edema/rash, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute exacerbation of respiratory failure due to hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia.
2. Worsening of renal function leading to further acute renal failure.
3. Uncontrolled tachycardia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Infection due to immunosuppression from cirrhosis, renal failure, or impaired skin integrity.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause further deterioration in mental status.
6. Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances due to diuretic resistance or inadequate fluid management.
7. Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and leg edema.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, heart rhythm, liver function, and fluid balance to prevent these potential complications."

   Respiratory failure:  Acute on chronic respiratory failure.

   Patient asked if he would want a breathing tube if he gets worse and he
   says that he would not want one under any circumstances.
   Acute on chronic renal failure:  will need HD.  He is very marginal,
   and may not tolerate going to IR to get tunneled line placed.  Would
   prefer
   to put in a bedside line temporarily and start HD here.  Will need FFP
   for procedure.
   Anasarca:  consider also paracentesis.
   tachycardia/AF:  Is extremely fluid overloaded with severe RV failure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic hypercarbia, and atrial fibrillation (AFib) who is on coumadin. He was admitted last week with decreased mental status and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient has chosen to forgo dialysis and does not want to be intubated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/62 mmHg to 124/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool with an ABG showing pH of 7.13, PaCO2 of 99, HCO3- of 81, and O2 saturation of 164 on FiO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, and he is somnolent. The lab results show elevated creatinine levels, low potassium levels, high lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, acute-on-chronic renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and other conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the"

   [**12-13**] CXR As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
   change. Perihilar haziness and increase in diameter of the pulmonary
   vasculature suggests mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, a
   preexisting left-sided consolidation in the basal lateral parts of the
   thorax
   could suggest a combination of pleural effusion and subsequent
   atelectasis.
   The fact that this opacity is completely unchanged since [**2100-12-11**]
   makes pneumonia rather unlikely.
   The presence of a small right-sided pleural effusion cannot be
   excluded. The
   cardiac silhouette appears to be mildly enlarged. There is no evidence
   of
   newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. The sternal wires are in
   unchanged alignment, the most caudal wire is ruptured. Unchanged clips
   projecting over the upper parts of the mediastinum.

            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes.
   # Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Unclear baseline - to what
   degree acidemia is due to acute hypoventilation vs. worsening of
   metabolic acidosis.  Patient likely hypoventilating at least in part
   due to reduced lung volumes due to worsening ascites.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   worsened by improved O2 sats.  Otherwise, acute component may be due to
   COPD vs. altered mental status.  Refuses bipap and intubation.  Unclear
   if Co2 retention also contributing to mental status.
   - A line placed, follow serial ABGs.
   - Had therapeutic para yesterday with removal of 6L fluids and albumin
   afterwards
   - Nebs prn to reduce obstructive component.
   - Aim for O2 sats in the 90 to 92 range.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxemia.  Improved this morning as hypoxemia
   seems to have improved, though the patient seems to need to remain
   sitting up.  Hypoxemia likely mostly volume overload/pulmonary edema
   plus left sided consolidation (which may be asymmetric edema vs.
   pneumonia/infectious consolidation; also may be layering effusion).  We
   were unsuccessful in removing fluid with a lasix drip, and needs line
   placement to begin CVVH and fluid removal.  He is in a very tenuous
   position for lying flat and having the line placed by IR, especially
   given his wish to not be intubated.  We would prefer bed-side placement
   of a temporary catheter to improve his respiratory status before a more
   permanent tunneled line is placed by IR.
   - Had bedside HD line placed and on UF.
   - Started heparin gtt with UF per renal recs
   - UF goal is 300-500 cc/hr
   - Continue to hold off on antibiotics except for cipro as below.
   - Nebs prn for wheezing.
   - Lower delivered O2 to achieve goal sat 90-93%.
   - Does not want BiPAP
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease.
   - Continue digoxin 0.125 qod
   - Hold coumadin for now given planned procedures.  Will need FFP prior
   to line placement.
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 3.
   - Will change to 200mg q12 per renal recs
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - initiation of HD; f/u renal recs.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin.
   - dialysis
   - NGT if not safely taking PO and patient amenable.
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - diuresis as above.
   - continue BB and digoxin.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose.
   - LVP for comfort, rule out infection.
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider NG tube placement until mental status
   hopefully improves with dialysis.  Need to discuss with patient.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, peripherals

   Imaging: No CXR this am
   [**12-13**] CXR As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
   change. Perihilar haziness and increase in diameter of the pulmonary
   vasculature suggests mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, a
   preexisting left-sided consolidation in the basal lateral parts of the
   thorax
   could suggest a combination of pleural effusion and subsequent
   atelectasis.
   The fact that this opacity is completely unchanged since [**2100-12-11**]
   makes pneumonia rather unlikely.
   The presence of a small right-sided pleural effusion cannot be
   excluded. The
   cardiac silhouette appears to be mildly enlarged. There is no evidence
   of
   newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. The sternal wires are in
   unchanged alignment, the most caudal wire is ruptured. Unchanged clips
   projecting over the upper parts of the mediastinum.

            This organism may develop resistance to third generation
            cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates
   that
            are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious

            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
   warranted
            if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes.
   # Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Unclear baseline - to what
   degree acidemia is due to acute hypoventilation vs. worsening of
   metabolic acidosis.  Patient likely hypoventilating at least in part
   due to reduced lung volumes due to worsening ascites.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be
   worsened by improved O2 sats.  Otherwise, acute component may be due to
   COPD vs. altered mental status.  Refuses bipap and intubation.  Unclear
   if Co2 retention also contributing to mental status.
   - A line placed, follow serial ABGs.
   - Will do therapeutic paracentesis today, which should allow larger
   lung volumes.
   - Nebs prn to reduce obstructive component.
   - Improve mental status with lactulose/rifaximin
   - Aim for O2 sats in the 90 to 92 range.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxemia.  Improved this morning as hypoxemia
   seems to have improved, though the patient seems to need to remain
   sitting up.  Hypoxemia likely mostly volume overload/pulmonary edema
   plus left sided consolidation (which may be asymmetric edema vs.
   pneumonia/infectious consolidation; also may be layering effusion).  We
   were unsuccessful in removing fluid with a lasix drip, and needs line
   placement to begin CVVH and fluid removal.  He is in a very tenuous
   position for lying flat and having the line placed by IR, especially
   given his wish to not be intubated.  We would prefer bed-side placement
   of a temporary catheter to improve his respiratory status before a more
   permanent tunneled line is placed by IR.
   - Bedside dialysis line placement by our team or renal.  Will need FFP
   prior to procedure.
   - Continue to hold off on antibiotics except for cipro as below.
   - Therapeutic paracentesis today.
   - Nebs prn for wheezing.
   - Retry bipap if will tolerate.
   - Lower delivered O2 to achieve goal sat 90-93%.
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease.
   - As has only received single dose of digoxin recently, will half-load
   with 0.5 mg IV x 1 now.
   - Patient is struggling to take all of his pills PO (can take limited
   amount) so we can give lopressor IV if unable to take PO dose.
   - Hold coumadin for now given planned procedures.  Will need FFP prior
   to line placement.
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 2.
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - initiation of HD; f/u renal recs.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin.
   - dialysis
   - NGT if not safely taking PO and patient amenable.
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - diuresis as above.
   - continue BB and digoxin.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose.
   - LVP for comfort, rule out infection.
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider NG tube placement until mental status
   hopefully improves with dialysis.  Need to discuss with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes a recent diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis, acute renal failure, and chronic respiratory acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and left-sided consolidation. Therapeutic paracentesis has been planned to improve lung volumes, and nebulizers will be used as needed to reduce obstructive component.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine level in the 3s. He requires hemodialysis for fluid removal and electrolyte management.
3. Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's tachycardia is difficult to control, and there is worsening of atrial fibrillation. Half-loading with digoxin and holding coumadin are part of the management plan.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Enterobacter cloacae is growing from the urine culture, which is sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patient is on a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypercarbia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, or infection. Lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has signs of chronic right ventricular failure and is volume overloaded. Diuretics will be used for fluid removal, and beta-blockers and digoxin will continue.
7. Cirrhosis: The patient has documented alcoholic cirrhosis. Management includes lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and consideration of liver transplantation.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia with episodes of guaiac-positive stool and Hct drops. Prophylactic measures include holding coumadin and considering Procrit if needed.
9. Leg Edema/Rash: The patient has leg edema with hyperkeratosis and lymphedema. Wound care and monitoring of the site are important.
10. Code Status: The patient has confirmed DNR/DNI wishes, which need to be discussed further with the patient and family.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with severe right ventricular (RV) failure, cirrhosis, and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and received dialysis and paracentesis. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. He is currently on various medications and treatments, including heparin, norepinephrine, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to deteriorate, resulting in worsening kidney function and potential complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for long-term dialysis.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could indicate underlying cardiac issues or stress on the body. Prolonged tachycardia can lead to complications like arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, increasing the risk of infections, pressure ulcers, and poor wound healing.
5. Alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver: The patient's liver disease can progress and lead to complications such as hepatic en"

   Continue CVVH
   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed from abdomen in past 2days.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved this morning as
   compared to the past couple days, where he has intermittently appeared
   to be very literally deathly ill. In these past two instances, large
   volume para's were performed and pt improved. He has had 14L removed
   from his abdomen, about 4L removed from UF yesterday and 2.7L removed
   just through today. His ABG has improved and he looks better.
   - Continue CVVH with goal 400cc/hr per Renal
   - A line is placed, continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts over past 2 days
   - Will give albuterol/ipratropium today as L lung sounds tight and
   wheezy
   - Will optimize cardiac contribution to respiratory status as below
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Unclear at this point what to do if pt acutely decompensates. Pt has
   been documented to refuse BiPAP in the past, but in asking him, he will
   occasionally want it, and other times not. The same goes for his
   cardiac resuscitation, which I asked him about this morning. He said
   that he would want chest compressions and shocks, but his records show
   a clear history of wanting to be DNR/DNI. He did state this morning
   that he would NOT want to be intubated. Frankly, I don't believe he has
   the mental clarity at this point to fully understand the consequences
   of his decisions. His mental status absolutely waxes and wanes. Will
   need to f/u with Ethics consult and further clarify this issue.
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked this am is therapeutic. Currently, pt is
   hypotense to the 90's and tachycardic to the 110's.
   - EKG this morning.
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue.
   - Will add a pure beta 1 blocker to try and slow his rate down. If
   unable to take PO, can give IV. Consider placing NGT for PO meds.
   - Currently anticoagulated with Heparin gtt for CVVH/UF.
   - To get Dig today, is currently being dosed qod.
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 3.
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> may need to place NGT as pt intermittently
   unable to take PO's.
   - dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin and will start pure beta 1 blocker today
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose.
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  [**Month (only) 8**] need to consider NG tube placement until mental status
   hopefully improves with dialysis.  Have discussed with pt and agreed
   that if he is able to take pills orally will avoid NGT, but if unable
   will place NGT. Again, hard to gauge how competent pt's decision making
   ability is, but I believe he understood.
   Prophylaxis: systemic heparin while on CVVH, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, peripherals
   Code:  DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient, who is quite clear about these
   wishes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and congestive heart failure. The patient has been improving with the removal of abdominal fluid, CVVH, and other treatments. However, there are potential medical complications that can arise such as respiratory distress, tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, anemia, and leg edema/rash.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has had episodes of respiratory distress in the past, which improved after large volume paracentesis. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and provide appropriate interventions.
2. Tachycardia/atrial fibrillation: The patient has tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, which may be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary disease. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture. Antibiotic therapy should be continued as prescribed.

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed from abdomen in past 2days.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved this morning as
   compared to the past couple days, where he has intermittently appeared
   to be very literally deathly ill. In these past two instances, large
   volume para's were performed and pt improved. He has had 14L removed
   from his abdomen, about 4L removed from UF yesterday and 2.7L removed
   just through today. His ABG has improved and he looks better.
   - Continue CVVH with goal 400cc/hr per Renal
   - A line is placed, continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts over past 2 days
   - Will give albuterol/ipratropium today as L lung sounds tight and
   wheezy. Be cautious with giving as pt already tachycardic.
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked this am is therapeutic. Currently, pt is
   hypotense to the 90's and tachycardic to the 110's.
   - EKG this morning
 f/u
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue.
   - Currently anticoagulated with Heparin gtt for CVVH/UF.
   - To get Dig today, is currently being dosed qod.
   - Will watch tachycardia today, as trying to get rate down with
   Bblocker would be risky to his already tenuous blood pressure
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 4.
   - Dosage changed yesterday according to renal recs, 200mg IV q12
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt is being anticoagulated and is risky.
   Will just try to encourage PO
s for now.
   - dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO
   meds
   Prophylaxis: systemic heparin while on CVVH, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, peripherals
   Code:  DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient, who is quite clear about these
   wishes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. He has been initiated on hemodialysis and is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has experienced significant fluid shifts, with a total of 14 liters of abdominal fluid removed over the past two days. His arterial blood gas (ABG) has improved, indicating better respiratory function.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, acute tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and congestive heart failure. He is also experiencing anemia and leg edema with rashes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient appears much improved this morning after removal of large volumes of abdominal fluid. His ABG has improved, and he looks better. It is recommended to continue CVVH with a goal of 400 cc/hr as per renal recommendations. Oxygen saturation should be maintained in the low 90's. Albuterol/ipratropium will be given today for tight lung sounds, but caution should be taken due to tachycardia.

2. Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is difficult to control, especially with attempts at diuresis and inability to mobilize third-space fluids. Dig"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed from abdomen in past 2days.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved this morning as
   compared to the past couple days, where he has intermittently appeared
   to be very literally deathly ill. In these past two instances, large
   volume para's were performed and pt improved. He has had 14L removed
   from his abdomen, about 4L removed from UF yesterday and 2.7L removed
   just through today.
   - Continue CVVH with goal 400cc/hr per Renal
   - A line is placed, continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts over past 2 days
   - Will give albuterol/ipratropium. Be cautious with giving as pt
   already tachycardic.
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   .
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked this am is therapeutic. Currently, pt is
   hypotense to the 90's and tachycardic to the 110's.
   - EKG this morning f/u
   - Pt continues on phenylephrine for pressor support. Will continue.
   - Currently anticoagulated with Heparin gtt for CVVH/UF.
   - To get Dig today, is currently being dosed qod.
   - Will watch tachycardia today, as trying to get rate down with
   Bblocker would be risky to his already tenuous blood pressure
   .
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 5
   - Dosage changed yesterday according to renal recs, 200mg IV q12
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt is being anticoagulated and is risky.
   Will just try to encourage PO
s for now.
   - dialysis
   .
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   .
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   .
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   .

   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes renal failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), cardiomyopathy, anasarca, shortness of breath, and cirrhosis related to alcohol use. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for hemodialysis due to encephalopathy. 

The patient's current condition shows signs of respiratory distress, with intermittent episodes of severe illness that improve after large volume paracentesis. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, with difficulty controlling heart rate. 

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patient is being treated with a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

The patient also has acute renal failure with baseline creatinine levels in the 3s, chronic volume overload, and altered mental status, potentially due to hypercarbia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, or infection.

Other medical issues include congestive heart failure with right ventricular (RV) failure and normal left ventricular (LV) function, cirrhosis related to ethanol use, anemia, and leg edema/rash with possible hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for renal failure, phenylephrine for pressor support, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old man with severe right ventricular (RV) failure, chronic respiratory failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure. He is currently showing marked improvement in respiratory failure and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for acute renal failure.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure needs to be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain optimal pCO2 levels.

2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing an increased heart rate, which may be due to atrial fibrillation (AF). It is important to control the heart rate and maintain overall cardiac function.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of edema and distended abdomen suggests potential skin integrity issues. Regular assessments and appropriate interventions should be done to prevent further complications.

4. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, and appropriate management strategies should be implemented to prevent further deterioration of liver function.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient is on CVVH for acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal parameters and ongoing evaluation of renal function are necessary.

6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is on ciprofloxacin for UTI. Monitoring for any signs of infection or antibiotic-related side effects is important.

7. Cardiovascular issues: With"

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved this morning as
   compared to the past couple days, where he has intermittently appeared
   to be very literally deathly ill. In these past two instances, large
   volume para's were performed and pt improved. He has had 14L removed
   from his abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative.
   - Currently much improved after large volume para's and fluid removal
   by CVVH
   - Per renal, can be less aggressive with UF, down to 100cc/hr
   - Continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts over past 2 days
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. This morning, pt seen to be
   more acutely tachycardic to the 150
s, with bp
s the same in the 90
   systolic.
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue and try to
   wean as tolerated
   - [**Month (only) 8**] have had too much fluid pulled off yesterday which is now causing
   his tachycardia. Will give 500cc bolus today and see if that improves
   his heart rate at all.
   - If continued tachycardia through IVF
s, consider another 500cc bolus
   vs giving a Ca channel blocker.
   - Currently anticoagulated with Heparin gtt for CVVH/UF --> will start
   on heparin gtt until CVVH started, as pt doesn't want NGT placed and
   don't want next filter to clot off again
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing
 will get repeat Dig level
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 6.
   - Dosage changed according to renal recs, 200mg IV q12
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt is being anticoagulated and is risky.
   Will just try to encourage PO
s for now.
   - Pt doesn't want to take Lactulose bc he states it gives him diarrhea.
   His mental status is fairly clear now though.
   - Dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO
   meds
   Prophylaxis: systemic heparin while on CVVH, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, L IJ
   Code:  DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient, who is quite clear about these
   wishes.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient's condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and other comorbidities.

Summary of Information:
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, which appears to be improving after large volume paracentesis and fluid removal through CVVH.
- The patient's renal function is stable, but they have acute renal failure with baseline creatinine levels in the 3s. They are currently volume overloaded and on CVVH with plans for follow-up with renal.
- The patient's mental status is fluctuating and includes hypercarbia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and infection. They are not consistently taking lactulose/rifaximin as prescribed.
- The patient has congestive heart failure with documented right ventricular failure and normal left ventricular function. They are on diuretics and digoxin.
- The patient has cirrhosis, which is related to alcohol use, along with potential elements of right ventricular failure or cardiac ascites. They are being treated with rifaximin and lactulose.
- The patient has anemia, with episodes of guaiac positive stool leading to transfusion during rehabilitation. Their hematocrit is stable in the ICU"

   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved this morning as
   compared to the past couple days, where he has intermittently appeared
   to be very literally deathly ill. In these past two instances, large
   volume para's were performed and pt improved. He has had 14L removed
   from his abdomen, about 4L removed from UF yesterday and 2.7L removed
   just through today. His ABG has improved and he looks better.
   - Currently much improved after large volume para's and fluid removal
   by CVVH
   - Need to get CVVH back up and running this morning, goal of 400 cc's
   per hour removal
   - Continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts over past 2 days
   - Will give albuterol/ipratropium today as L lung sounds tight and
   wheezy. Be cautious with giving as pt already tachycardic.
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked this am is therapeutic. Currently, pt is
   hypotense to the 90's and tachycardic to the 110's.
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue and try to
   wean as tolerated
   - Currently anticoagulated with Heparin gtt for CVVH/UF --> will start
   on heparin gtt until CVVH started, as pt doesn't want NGT placed and
   don't want next filter to clot off again
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing
   - Will watch tachycardia today, as trying to get rate down with
   Bblocker would be risky to his already tenuous blood pressure
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 6.
   - Dosage changed according to renal recs, 200mg IV q12
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt is being anticoagulated and is risky.
   Will just try to encourage PO
s for now.
   - Pt doesn't want to take Lactulose bc he states it gives him diarrhea.
   His mental status is fairly clear now though.
   - dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - obtain OSH records (recent liver biopsy).
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO
   meds
   Prophylaxis: systemic heparin while on CVVH, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, L IJ
   Code:  DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient, who is quite clear about these
   wishes.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, chronic renal failure (acute on chronic), tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), and congestive heart failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, improved air movement in the lungs, and a soft abdomen with chronic lymphedematous changes/anasarcatous.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, but normal international normalized ratio. The microbiology report indicates no growth of organisms in the paracentesis fluid, and the DFA is negative for flu.

The patient's goals of care have been changed from comfort measures only (CMO) to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), with the understanding that hemodialysis"

   Patient with more tachycardia this morning; ECG without acute ischemic
   changes. Still in afib. I suspect that patient may have had more fluid
   removed yesterday than he could mobilize from the interstitial space
   and, consequently, had gotten intravascular volume depletion. Will give
   fluid back now and reassess. [**Month (only) 8**] need some calcium blockade if fluids
   do not assist in slowing rate.
   ABG's show good oxygenation and stable chronic respiratory acidosis.
   Creat up slightly today; possibly related to intravascular volume
   depletion. Continue to monitor. Electrolytes acceptable.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues, including hypercapnic respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, systolic heart failure, and impaired skin integrity. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has hypercapnic respiratory failure, which indicates difficulty in effectively exchanging carbon dioxide and oxygen in the lungs. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed properly.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has both chronic renal failure and acute renal failure (acute on chronic), indicating compromised kidney function. This increases the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, accumulation of waste products in the body, and potential kidney damage.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating tachycardia. If not addressed, this can lead to decreased cardiac output, arrhythmias, and increased strain on the heart.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infections, pressure ulcers, and other skin-related complications.

5. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, which can lead to complications such as liver failure, portal hypertension, and an increased risk of bleeding.

6. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to"

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved this morning as
   compared to the past couple days, where he has intermittently appeared
   to be very literally deathly ill. In these past two instances, large
   volume para's were performed and pt improved. He has had 14L removed
   from his abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative.
   - Currently much improved after large volume para's and fluid removal
   by CVVH
   - Per renal, can be less aggressive with UF, down to 100cc/hr
   - Continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts over past 2 days
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. This morning, pt seen to be
   more acutely tachycardic to the 150
s, with bp
s the same in the 90
   systolic.
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue and try to
   wean as tolerated
   - [**Month (only) 8**] have had too much fluid pulled off yesterday which is now causing
   his tachycardia. Will give 500cc bolus today and see if that improves
   his heart rate at all.
   - If continued tachycardia through IVF
s, consider another 500cc bolus
   vs giving a Ca channel blocker.
   - Currently anticoagulated with Heparin gtt for CVVH/UF --> will start
   on heparin gtt until CVVH started, as pt doesn't want NGT placed and
   don't want next filter to clot off again
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing
 will get repeat Dig level
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course, today day 6.
   - Dosage changed according to renal recs, 200mg IV q12
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt is being anticoagulated and is risky.
   Will just try to encourage PO
s for now.
   - Pt doesn't want to take Lactulose bc he states it gives him diarrhea.
   His mental status is fairly clear now though.
   - Dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO
   meds

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been improving after large volume paracentesis and fluid removal by CVVH. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving phenylephrine as a pressor, and being treated with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection. The patient's goals of care have been changed from comfort measures only (CMO) to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), with the understanding that hemodialysis is still acceptable per patient wishes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which may worsen if there is an infection or if the mechanical ventilation settings need to be adjusted.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is a need to continue CVVH and monitor ABG's closely. Adjustments in fluid removal rate and medication dosages may be required based on renal function.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, potentially due to intravascular shifts or pulmonary disease. It is important to closely monitor the heart rate and consider further interventions"

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. He has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and alcohol use disorder.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory distress: The patient appears much improved compared to his previous presentation. He has benefited from large volume paracentesis, with a total of 14 liters of fluid removed from his abdomen, as well as fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), totaling 33 liters negative.

   Patient more alert this AM. Suspect the rise in PaCO2 yesterday was
   related to sleep. Oxygen sats in mid-90's now without supplemental
   oxygen. I would aim now for 1-2L negative fluid balance with CVVH. Try
   to wean phenylephrine. If mental status okay, would tolerate BP 90
   systolic.
   Heart rate in 100-110 range in afib. Continue to monitor. Consider

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very literally deathly ill. Pt has
   benefited from large volume para's. He has had 14L removed from his
   abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative. Now breathing comfortably on 2L NC.
   - Per renal, plan for HD tomorrow if can be weaned off of pressor
   today.
   - Afternoon ABG's
   - Paracentesis today (and 50 albumin) (perhaps goal of 6L off)
   - If pt decompensates, certainly consider para, but would be cautious
   given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**]. Would also
   consider fluid removal by CVVH/UF. Would also offer the pt BiPAP which
   it is not entirely clear he would accept or reject.
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx as he has no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Previously, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.
   - Pt continues on Neo (0.7) for pressure support. Will continue and try
   to wean as tolerated
   - Start diltiazem 30mg po qid, to try to help tachycardia without
   dropping BP
   - If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Yesterday ([**12-19**]) completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Plan for HD tomorrow, if can come off of pressor today.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt now taking these meds, after
   intermittently not taking meds. Have discussed placing NGT, but pt
   doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking good PO
s (as he is) and
   taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - encourage taking meds
   - Dialysis as above
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet (as mental status now
   allowing this diet type).
   Prophylaxis: SQ heparin (only daily dosing, given renal failure), bowel
   regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, L IJ

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, chronic renal failure (acute on chronic), tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), and congestive heart failure. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, has been receiving phenylephrine (levophed) to support blood pressure, and is unable to wean off it. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and albumin levels. Blood cultures have shown no growth, but enterobacter was found in the urine culture. 

The patient's abdominal fluid removal has been significant, with a total of 14 liters removed, along with fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient's mental status is improving, and the respiratory distress has improved as well. 

The plan for the patient includes initiating hemodialysis tomorrow if the patient can be weaned"

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very literally deathly ill. Pt has
   benefited from large volume para's. He has had 14L removed from his
   abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative.
   - Per renal, can be less aggressive with UF, down to 100cc/hr
   - Will need to f/u with renal about when they plan to do IHD or UF/CVVH
   again.
   - Continue to watch ABG's
   - If pt decompensates, could consider another para, but would be
   hesitant given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**]. Would
   favor fluid removal by CVVH/UF. Would also offer the pt BiPAP which it
   is not entirely clear he would accept or reject.
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx except Cipro for UTI as below for now, as he has
   no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Yesterday, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue and try to
   wean as tolerated
   - If continued tachycardia through IVF
s, consider another 500cc bolus
   vs giving a Ca channel blocker.
   - Will restart Heparin gtt
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Yesterday ([**12-19**]) completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking
   good PO
s and taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - Pt doesn't want to take Lactulose bc he states it gives him diarrhea.
   His mental status is fairly clear now though. Keep encouraging him to
   take it.
   - Dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO
   meds.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/54 mmHg to 86/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off levophed.

The patient has undergone several interventions including large volume paracentesis, CVVH/UF to manage fluid overload and remove para fluid, and has had enterobacter identified in his urine culture. The patient's renal function is compromised, and further discussions are needed regarding the plan for hemodialysis or CVVH.

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to various factors such as hypercarbia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and infection. Lactulose has been initiated, but the patient complains of diarrhea and refuses to continue taking it.

The patient's respiratory distress has improved significantly with the removal of para fluid and CVVH. However, the patient's tach"

   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Yesterday, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.
   - Pt continues on Neo for pressor support. Will continue and try to
   wean as tolerated
   - If continued tachycardia through IVF
s, consider another 500cc bolus
   vs giving a Ca channel blocker.
   - Will restart Heparin gtt
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - Yesterday ([**12-19**]) completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Continue with CVVH, and f/u with renal.
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt intermittently not taking meds. Have
   discussed placing NGT, but pt doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking
   good PO
s and taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - Pt doesn't want to take Lactulose bc he states it gives him diarrhea.
   His mental status is fairly clear now though. Keep encouraging him to
   take it.
   - Dialysis
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Diuresis as above.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet if mental status
   allows.  Encourage PO ice chips in order to push compliance with PO
   meds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and other comorbidities. The patient has been initiated on hemodialysis, and large volumes of fluid have been removed from his abdomen and through CVVH. His respiratory distress has improved with the removal of para fluids. The patient has also shown improvement in mental status, and his goals of care have been changed from comfort measures only (CMO) to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to fluid overload and pulmonary disease.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to intravascular shifts, current pulmonary disease, or inability to mobilize third space fluids. It needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infection and poor wound healing.
5. Cirrhosis of the"

   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Hepatomegaly/Anasarca/Abdominal pain:  Patient with diffuse abdominal
   pain and Anasarca, s/p paracentesis yesterday with fluid analysis which
   does not meet criteria for SBP.
   - Abdominal US with Doppler flows for hepatic vein to r/o Budd Chiari
   syndrome
   - Consider paracentesis today or tomorrow as needed
   - Paracentesis fluid not meet criteria for SBP and pt afebrile; hold
   initiating abx for now
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very literally deathly ill. Pt has
   benefited from large volume para's. He has had 14L removed from his
   abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative. Now breathing comfortably on 2L NC.
   - Per renal, plan for HD today (or tomorrow)
   - Afternoon ABG's
   - Consider repeat paracentesis as needed
   - If pt decompensates, certainly consider para, but would be cautious
   given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**]. Would also
   consider fluid removal by CVVH/UF. Would also offer the pt BiPAP which
   it is not entirely clear he would accept or reject.
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx as he has no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Previously, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.
   - Pt off Neo as of [**12-21**].
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg po qid, to try to help tachycardia without
   dropping BP
   - If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing with dig levels given renal failure
   - ?anticoagulation
 discuss possibility of anticoagulation for a fib
   (INR 1.3 today)
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Plan for HD today per Renal
   - Contact IR to  tunnel dialysis catheter
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - [**12-19**] completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt now taking these meds, after
   intermittently not taking meds. Have discussed placing NGT, but pt
   doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking good PO
s (as he is) and
   taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - encourage taking meds
   - Dialysis as above
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), tachycardia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver.

The patient's current goals of care have been transitioned from comfort measures only (CMO) to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), but hemodialysis (HD) is still planned per patient wishes. The patient has undergone paracentesis, with a significant amount of fluid removed from the abdomen.

The patient's respiratory distress has improved in the past couple of days, and he is now breathing comfortably on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC). The plan for HD today or tomorrow is in place, along with consideration for repeat paracentesis as needed. If the patient decompensates, CVVH/UF may be considered for fluid removal.

The patient's tachycardia, likely related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability to mobilize third space fluids or current pulmonary disease, has been difficult to control. Diltiazem is being continued to help manage the tachycardia without dropping the blood pressure.

The patient's acute renal failure, with baseline creatinine in the 3s for at least the last few weeks, requires hemodialysis today per renal consultation. Contact with interventional radiology (IR) has been made to tunnel a dialysis catheter.

A urinary tract infection (UTI) has been identified, with growth of ciprofloxacin-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture. The patient completed a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

Other stable or less active issues include altered mental status, congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, anemia, and leg edema/rash. The altered mental status is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin. The CHF is being treated with digoxin. Rifaximin and lactulose are being used for cirrhosis management. Anemia management is ongoing, and the leg edema/rash is being monitored.

Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PICC line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is pending clinical improvement."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, chronic renal failure (acute on chronic), tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), and other comorbidities.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, acute renal failure, altered mental status, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, anemia, and leg edema/rash. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax: 36.9°C, Tcurrent: 36.9°C), heart rate (HR: 83 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 92/46 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 21 insp/min), and oxygen saturation (SpO2: 95%).

The patient has undergone several interventions including paracentesis, midodrine administration, and initiation of hemodialysis. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and coagulation profile.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in renal function, uncontrolled tachycardia, hepatic encephalopathy, infections (e.g., urinary tract infection), and bleeding due to coagulopathy.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management"

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Hepatomegaly/Anasarca/Abdominal pain:  Patient with diffuse abdominal
   pain and
   - Abdominal US with Doppler flows for hepatic vein to r/o Budd Chiari
   syndrome
   - Consider paracentesis today or tomorrow as needed
   - Paracentesis fluid not meet criteria for SBP and pt afebrile; hold
   initiating abx for now
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very literally deathly ill. Pt has
   benefited from large volume para's. He has had 14L removed from his
   abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative. Now breathing comfortably on 2L NC.
   - Per renal, plan for HD today (or tomorrow)
   - Afternoon ABG's
   - Consider repeat paracentesis as needed
   - If pt decompensates, certainly consider para, but would be cautious
   given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**]. Would also
   consider fluid removal by CVVH/UF. Would also offer the pt BiPAP which
   it is not entirely clear he would accept or reject.
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx as he has no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Previously, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.
   - Pt off Neo as of [**12-21**].
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg po qid, to try to help tachycardia without
   dropping BP
   - If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing with dig levels given renal failure
   - ?anticoagulation
 discuss possibility of anticoagulation for a fib
   (INR 1.3 today)
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Plan for HD today per Renal
   - Contact IR to  tunnel dialysis catheter
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - [**12-19**] completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt now taking these meds, after
   intermittently not taking meds. Have discussed placing NGT, but pt
   doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking good PO
s (as he is) and
   taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - encourage taking meds
   - Dialysis as above
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet (as mental status now
   allowing this diet type).
   Prophylaxis: SQ heparin (only daily dosing, given renal failure), bowel
   regimen, PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that need attention. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca (generalized edema) and shortness of breath.
- The patient's goals of care have transitioned from comfort measures only (CMO) to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), but hemodialysis (HD) is still planned per patient wishes.
- The patient has been receiving large-volume paracentesis, and a significant amount of fluid has been removed from his abdomen and through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- The patient's respiratory status has improved compared to previous presentations, but he is still on supplemental oxygen.
- The patient has renal failure, both acute and chronic, and will undergo hemodialysis today.
- The patient's tachycardia may be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary disease.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity, including hyperkeratosis and blistering in the coccyx area.
- The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which is likely alcohol-related.
- Other stable or less active issues include altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UT"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has now started UF
   and has had 14L of para fluid removed, along with quite a bit of fluid
   from UF.
   # Hepatomegaly/Anasarca/Abdominal pain:  Patient with diffuse abdominal
   pain and Anasarca, s/p paracentesis yesterday with fluid analysis which
   does not meet criteria for SBP.
   - Abdominal US with Doppler flows for hepatic vein to r/o Budd Chiari
   syndrome
   - Consider paracentesis today or tomorrow as needed
   - Paracentesis fluid not meet criteria for SBP and pt afebrile; hold
   initiating abx for now
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very literally deathly ill. Pt has
   benefited from large volume para's. He has had 14L removed from his
   abdomen, and a lot of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total
   negative. Now breathing comfortably on 2L NC.
   - Per renal, plan for HD today (or tomorrow)
   - Afternoon ABG's
   - Consider repeat paracentesis as needed
   - If pt decompensates, certainly consider para, but would be cautious
   given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**]. Would also
   consider fluid removal by CVVH/UF. Would also offer the pt BiPAP which
   it is not entirely clear he would accept or reject.
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx as he has no evidence of pulmonary infection
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lateley.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Previously, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.
   - Pt off Neo as of [**12-21**].
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg po qid, to try to help tachycardia without
   dropping BP
   - If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing with dig levels given renal failure
   - ?anticoagulation
 discuss possibility of anticoagulation for a fib
   (INR 1.3 today)
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.
   - Plan for HD today per Renal
   - Contact IR to  tunnel dialysis catheter
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.
   - [**12-19**] completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt now taking these meds, after
   intermittently not taking meds. Have discussed placing NGT, but pt
   doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking good PO
s (as he is) and
   taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - encourage taking meds
   - Dialysis as above
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Digoxin as above.
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guiaic pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet (as mental status now
   allowing this diet type).
   Prophylaxis: SQ heparin (only daily dosing, given renal failure), bowel
   regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, L IJ
   Code:  DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient, who is quite clear about these
   wishes.
   Communication: Patient, sister [**Name (NI) 412**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10047**]
   [**Name2 (NI) **]osition: pending clinical improvement
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy. He presented with anasarca (generalized swelling) and shortness of breath. The patient's goals of care have been changed from comfort measures only (CMO) to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI), but hemodialysis is still being pursued per the patient's wishes. The patient has undergone paracentesis, removing a total of 14 liters of ascitic fluid from his abdomen. He also had fluid removed from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's respiratory distress has improved, and he is now breathing comfortably on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia/Afib: The patient has an ongoing issue with rapid heart rate and atrial fibrillation. Efforts to rate control have been somewhat successful but may be limited by low blood pressure. The tachycardia may be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability to mobilize third space fluids, or it may be related to current pulmonary disease. Digoxin levels are therapeutic, but the patient remains tachycardic, possibly due to an inability to give more fluids due to anuria (no urine output) and ongoing hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Consideration should be given"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has had fluid removed
   with ultrafiltration and will be initiating HD.
   .
   # Hepatomegaly/Anasarca/Abdominal pain:  Patient with diffuse abdominal
   pain and Anasarca, s/p paracentesis yesterday with fluid analysis which
   does not meet criteria for SBP.   Abdominal US with Doppler flows for
   hepatic vein did not show Budd Chiari syndrome.   Abdominal pain
   improved today
   - Paracentesis as needed
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very ill. Pt has benefited from large
   volume paracenteses. He has had 14L removed from his abdomen, and a lot
   of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total negative. Now breathing
   comfortably on 2L NC.
   - Per renal, plan for HD today
   - Afternoon ABG's
   - Consider repeat paracentesis as needed
   - If pt decompensates, certainly consider para, but would be cautious
   given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**].
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx as he has no evidence of pulmonary infection
   .
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lately.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Previously, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.  Patient was able to be weaned from pressors and is on
   midodrine.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg po qid, to try to help tachycardia without
   dropping BP
   - If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing with dig levels given renal failure
   - start on ASA and consider anticoagulation in the future
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.  Had a tunneled
   catheter today.
   - Plan for HD today per Renal
   - Need to pull temporary HD catheter
   .
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.  [**12-19**]
   completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt now taking these meds, after
   intermittently not taking meds. Have discussed placing NGT, but pt
   doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking good PO
s (as he is) and
   taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - encourage taking meds
   - Dialysis as above
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Digoxin as above.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   .
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guaiac pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   .
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet (as mental status now
   allowing this diet type).
   Prophylaxis: SQ heparin (only daily dosing, given renal failure), bowel
   regimen, PPI
   Access: PICC, a-line, L IJ
   Code:  DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient, who is quite clear about these
   wishes.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and cardiomyopathy. He presented with anasarca (generalized swelling) and shortness of breath, and plans for initiating hemodialysis have been made.
- The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain and anasarca, with fluid removed through paracentesis. The fluid analysis does not meet criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and an abdominal ultrasound with Doppler did not show evidence of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
- The patient's respiratory distress has improved significantly after large-volume paracenteses and continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). He is now breathing comfortably on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC).
- The patient's tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF) appear to be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary disease. Digoxin levels are therapeutic, and efforts are being made to control the heart rate without dropping blood pressure.
- The patient has acute renal failure, with baseline creatinine levels in the 3s for at least the last few weeks. Chronic kidney insufficiency is unclear, and the patient is volume overloaded. A tunneled cath"

   55M with history of Afib, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and
   shortness of breath with plan for initiation of hemodialysis;
   encephalopathy now improving with transition from goals of care from
   CMO to DNR/DNI but HD okay per patient wishes. Pt has had fluid removed
   with ultrafiltration and will be initiating HD.
   .
   # Hepatomegaly/Anasarca/Abdominal pain:  Patient with diffuse abdominal
   pain and Anasarca, s/p paracentesis yesterday with fluid analysis which
   does not meet criteria for SBP.   Abdominal US with Doppler flows for
   hepatic vein did not show Budd Chiari syndrome.   Abdominal pain
   improved today
   - Paracentesis as needed
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The pt appears much improved in the past couple
   days compared to his re-presentation to MICU, where he has
   intermittently appeared to be very ill. Pt has benefited from large
   volume paracenteses. He has had 14L removed from his abdomen, and a lot
   of fluid removed from CVVH, about 33L total negative. Now breathing
   comfortably on 2L NC.
   - Per renal, plan for HD today
   - Afternoon ABG's
   - Consider repeat paracentesis as needed
   - If pt decompensates, certainly consider para, but would be cautious
   given already large volume shifts from previous [**Doctor First Name 2826**].
   - Continue with albuterol/ipratropium as needed
   - Goals saturations will be low 90's
   - Will hold off on ABx as he has no evidence of pulmonary infection
   .
   # Tachycardia/Afib. Seems to be somewhat difficult to rate control at
   baseline (limited by BP) but notes suggest slightly worse lately.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   be related to intravascular shifts with attempts at diuresis/inability
   to mobilize third space fluids, or related to current pulmonary
   disease. Dig level checked is therapeutic. Previously, was tachy to
   150
s which responded to 500cc NS bolus, but we are hesitant to give
   him more fluids given he is anuric and CVVH/HD is the only way to get
   fluid off.  Patient was able to be weaned from pressors and is on
   midodrine.
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg po qid, to try to help tachycardia without
   dropping BP
   - If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc
   - Continue Dig at qod dosing with dig levels given renal failure
   - start on ASA and consider anticoagulation in the future
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Baseline prior to one month ago unknown, but has
   been in the 3s for at least the last few weeks.  Nature of chronic
   insufficiency unclear.  Volume overloaded currently.  Had a tunneled
   catheter today.
   - Plan for HD today per Renal
   - Need to pull temporary HD catheter
   .
   Other stable or less active issues:
   # UTI.  Growing cipro-sensitive enterobacter from urine culture.  [**12-19**]
   completed Ciprofloxacin x 7 day course
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Differential includes hypercarbia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, uremia, infection.
   - lactulose/rifaximin --> pt now taking these meds, after
   intermittently not taking meds. Have discussed placing NGT, but pt
   doesn
t want it. As long as he is taking good PO
s (as he is) and
   taking his Lactulose, not an issue.
   - encourage taking meds
   - Dialysis as above
   # Congestive heart failure.  Documented RV failure with normal LV.  Has
   signs of chronic RV failure on exam.
   - Digoxin as above.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Documented as EtOH related.  Also consider some element
   of RV failure ?cardiac ascites.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - now s/p two large volume paracenteses, could consider again if pt
   decompensates again from resp standpoint
   .
   # Anemia.  Episodes of guaiac pos stool and Hct drops, leading to
   transfusion at rehab.  HCt stable here.
   - Hold coumadin for now given upcoming procedures.
   - cannot receive Aranesp as inpatient, can consider Procrit if needed.
   .
   # Leg edema/rash. Appears to be hyperkeratosis from lymphedema.
   Unclear how much infection is playing a role.  Large ulcer with good
   granulation tissue, no evidence of surrounding infection.
   - continue to monitor site.
   - wound care following.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. He has chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and other medical conditions.

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including hemodialysis, paracentesis, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers as needed, diltiazem for tachycardia, digoxin for heart failure, ASA for future anticoagulation, and lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is at risk for further deterioration due to his underlying lung condition and fluid overload.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and requires ongoing management with hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function or infection related to the dialysis catheter.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which may be related to intravascular shifts, pulmonary disease, or heart failure. Control of heart rate may be challenging due to limited options for fluid administration.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with erythemat"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, presenting with anasarca and shortness of breath. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. The patient was previously admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and underwent paracentesis, with removal of 14 liters of fluid from his abdomen. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 111/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed erythematous, scaling, and new hematoma on the left lower extremity. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, total bilirubin, and liver enzymes. The fluid analysis of the peritoneal fluid did not show any signs of infection.

Plan:

1. Continue hemodialysis today.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
3. Continue diltiazem 30mg po qid to control tachycardia without dropping blood pressure.
4. If continued tachycardia, consider another 500cc NS bolus.
5. Continue digoxin at qod"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
   Acute on chronic Renal Failure:  will get HD today again.
   anasarca:  much improved.  Will probably benefit from another
   paracentesis 1-2 days.
   Afib:  on aspirin.  Unclear status currently.  Optimally should be on
   coumadin long term, but not sure
   what he is going to chose in terms of going home versus
   institutionalizations.
   MS:  much better
   CHF:  continue cirrhosis
   Had discussion with him about the future.  he would want to go home
   under all circumstances eventually, but is amenable to rehab stay, but
   this would be short term only.  Explained to him that this may not be
   possible.  He may need too much care to go home safely given multiple
   end organ failures and generalized debilitation.  If he does choose to
   go home, it probable should be on  hospice basis.  He said that he
   would think about this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with severe right ventricular failure, renal failure, cirrhosis, and massive fluid overload. He tolerated hemodialysis yesterday and had 2.5L of intravenous fluid removed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/50-122/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. He is currently receiving various medications, including digoxin, rifaximin, lactulose (refusing), sevelamer, fluconazole, vitamin D, atrovent, MVI, miconazole, heparin flush, prevacid, diltiazem 30mg qid, and midodrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his current condition.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. Further complications can arise if his renal function does not improve.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has edema in both lower extremities and small hematomas over his legs, indicating potential skin breakdown and increased risk of pressure ulcers.
4. Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, which may lead to complications such"
