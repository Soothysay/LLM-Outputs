   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o lady with hyptension presented to the Emergency Department with
   swollen tongue and funny feeling in her tongue and was intubated for
   airway protection.
   .
   # Angioedema:  Presentation consistent with anioedema and/or allergic
   reactioin.  Normal eos and only lip,cheeks,tongue swelling argues for
   angioedema.  Anesthesiologist who intubated her did not notice any
   airway swelling, all upper airway.  Has been on lisinopril since
   [**2127-1-23**].  History of using NSAIDS prn. No known new
   exposures.  SVC syndrome will be lower in the differential given no
   upper extremity swelling.  However she is on OCP.  No signs or symptoms
   of infection.
   -Swelling in lips, face, tongue greatly decreased today.
   - steroids solumedrol 125 IV q8h
   - diphenhydramine 50 IV q6h
   - famotidine 20 IV bid
   - appreciate allergy recs, ESR 20, will f/u on C4, C1 esterase inhib,
   TSH
   .
   # Intubation: For airway protection.
   -          remains on CMV [**1-24**] apnea with sedation. Switched to PS this
   am as sedation weaned
   -          touch base with anesthesia for presenses during extubation.
   -          Could cuff leak this am, edema greatly decreased should go
   ok.
   .
   # Multiple allergies:
   -          management as above.
   -          Document food exposure clearly after extubation.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Currently hypertensive.
   - will be careful in starting medication given allergy history and will
   not be able to clearly see whether she will become allergic.
   - would recommend short acting CCB, nifedipine
   .
   # hilar lymphadenopathy on  CXR:  Interesting incidental finding on
   CXR. Seen on previous films
   - needs out patient follow up, ? sarcoid. CT as outpatient
   .
   # Asthma:  Clear lung fields currently.
   - nebs prn
   .
   # Anemia: secondary to chonic uterine fibroids.
   - hold OCP during acute phase

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old lady who presented to the emergency department with swollen tongue and a funny feeling in her tongue. She was intubated for airway protection due to suspected angioedema and/or allergic reaction. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on lisinopril medication. She also has a history of using NSAIDs as needed and is taking oral contraceptives (OCP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and not responding to verbal stimuli. Physical examination reveals swollen lips and cheeks, with asymmetric swelling on the right side greater than the left. The oropharynx cannot be properly assessed due to swollen lips and the presence of an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels. The platelet count is slightly elevated at 199 K/uL. The differential shows an increased percentage of neutrophils (60.0%) and lymphocytes (32.3%).

The assessment and plan include ongoing management for angioedema, intubation for airway protection, allergies, hypertension, hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for angioedema. The patient was intubated due to mouth edema but not laryngeal edema. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with propofol infusion at 100/hr, fentanyl at 75 mcg/hr, and versed at 3 mg/hr. Allergies include erythromycin base, penicillins, codeine, bactrim DS, shellfish-derived products, and eggs. The patient is also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and famotidine (Pepcid).

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/76 to 160/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with total input of 1,630 mL and total output of 1,425 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 630 mL/hr.

The patient's blood products show a total out of 1,425 mL, including 430 mL of packed red blood cells. Urine output is also 1,425 mL. The respiratory support mode is CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and pulses. Lab results show WBC count of 5.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, glucose of 96 mg/dL, sodium of 24 mEq/L, potassium of 3.5 mEq/L, chloride of 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 34.6%, BUN of 12 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.5 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes an inability to protect the airway due to angioedema, with secondary risks of aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance. The patient has a history of asthma, hypertension, and allergies to certain medications.

Plan:
The patient requires ongoing ICU care with invasive ventilation and medication infusions. Nutrition and glycemic control will be managed in the ICU. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code."

","The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with swollen tongue and a funny feeling in her tongue. She was intubated for airway protection due to suspected angioedema. The patient has a history of hypertension, using NSAIDs as needed, and taking lisinopril since [**2127-1-23**]. She also has multiple drug allergies and is currently on oral contraceptive pills (OCP).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/76 mmHg to 160/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and a temperature of 37.7°C. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and a plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals swollen lips and asymmetric swelling of the cheeks, right greater than left. The oropharynx cannot be properly assessed due to swollen lips and the presence of an endotracheal tube. Other findings include S1S2 RRR heart sounds without murmurs, clear lung fields on chest auscultation, obesity with present bowel sounds, and warm and well-perfused extremities without edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with a swollen tongue and a funny feeling in her tongue. She was intubated for airway protection due to potential angioedema. The patient has multiple allergies, including to erythromycin base, penicillins, codeine, Bactrim DS, egg, shellfish, and lisinopril. She was started on steroids, famotidine, and benadryl. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals slight swelling in her right cheek but no obvious signs of angioedema. She is alert and oriented, with a slightly raspy voice. The patient's current medications include amlodipine, prednisone, diphenhydramine, famotidine, and heparin. She has ongoing assessments for hypertension, angioedema, allergies, asthma, anemia, prophylaxis, and FEN (possibly referring to her medical condition or treatment). The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, glucose, and other parameters. She has been extubated successfully without any issues overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient initially presented with angioedema leading to airway compromise, which necessitated intubation. Although the patient was successfully extubated, there is still a risk of recurrent airway obstruction if the angioedema worsens or if she develops any other conditions that may affect her airway.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently hypertensive. If not properly managed, hypertension can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.

3. Allergic reactions: Given the patient's known allergies, there is a risk of allergic reactions if she is exposed to allergens such as penicillins, codeine, or shellfish. It is important to avoid these triggers and promptly manage any allergic reactions that may occur.

4. Hilar lymphadenopathy: The patient has an incidental finding of hilar lymphadenopathy on her chest X-ray. Further investigation and follow-up are necessary to determine the cause and significance of this finding.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to chronic uterine fibroids. It is important to monitor her hemoglobin levels and consider appropriate management options to prevent complications associated with anemia.

6. Prolonged immobilization: If the patient is expected to be immobile for an extended period, there is a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin or compression stockings should be considered to reduce this risk.

7. Steroid-induced complications: Long-term use of steroids, like the patient's current treatment regimen, can lead to various complications such as diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, and adrenal suppression.

8. Infection: Due to the patient's ICU stay and invasive procedures, there is a risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with swollen tongue and funny feeling in her tongue. She was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema. The possible etiology of angioedema is unclear, but it is likely related to lisinopril or NSAIDs. The patient received steroid treatment, switch to oral prednisone with taper, and continues with diphenhydramine and famotidine. She also has multiple allergies.

The patient's current condition is stable with mild right facial swelling but improved overall since yesterday. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical examination shows no obvious signs of angioedema, clear lung fields, and no wheezes or crackles.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.0, hematocrit of 34.6, platelet count of 199, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 97 mg/dL. Anemia is secondary to chronic uterine fibroids. The patient has hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray, which will need follow-up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 87-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation and extubation. They have allergies to erythromycin base, penicillins, codeine, bactrim DS, egg, shellfish derived, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on various medications including steroids, Pepcid, benadryl, famotidine, and heparin sodium. There are no issues overnight. C1 esterase pends are pending. The patient has a history of asthma, hypertension, and angioedema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of invasive ventilation, there is a risk of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Allergic Reactions: The patient has multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to certain medications like penicillins and codeine. Therefore, any exposure to these allergens could cause an allergic reaction.
3. Blood Clots: The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, there is still a risk of developing blood clots, especially if the patient is immobile or"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o lady with hyptension presented to the Emergency Department with
   swollen tongue and funny feeling in her tongue and was intubated for
   airway protection.
   .
   # Angioedema:  Presentation consistent with anioedema and/or allergic
   reactioin.  Normal eos and only lip,cheeks,tongue swelling argues for
   angioedema.  Anesthesiologist who intubated her did not notice any
   airway swelling, all upper airway.  Has been on lisinopril since
   [**2127-1-23**].  History of using NSAIDS prn. No known new
   exposures.  SVC syndrome will be lower in the differential given no
   upper extremity swelling.  However she is on OCP.  No signs or symptoms
   of infection.
   -Swelling in lips, face, tongue greatly decreased today.
   - steroids solumedrol 125 IV q8h
   - diphenhydramine 50 IV q6h
   - famotidine 20 IV bid
   - appreciate allergy recs, ESR 20, will f/u on C4, C1 esterase inhib,
   TSH
   .
   # Intubation: For airway protection.
   -          remains on CMV [**1-24**] apnea with sedation. Switched to PS this
   am as sedation weaned
   -          touch base with anesthesia for presenses during extubation.
   -          Could cuff leak this am, edema greatly decreased should go
   ok.
   .
   # Multiple allergies:
   -          management as above.
   -          Document food exposure clearly after extubation.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Currently hypertensive.
   - will be careful in starting medication given allergy history and will
   not be able to clearly see whether she will become allergic.
   - would recommend short acting CCB, nifedipine
   .
   # hilar lymphadenopathy on  CXR:  Interesting incidental finding on
   CXR. Seen on previous films
   - needs out patient follow up, ? sarcoid. CT as outpatient
   .
   # Asthma:  Clear lung fields currently.
   - nebs prn
   .
   # Anemia: secondary to chonic uterine fibroids.
   - hold OCP during acute phase
   .
   # Prophylaxis: sc heparin tid; famotidine; ISS while on steroids
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now; replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: 2 PIV, NGT. Remove NGT with extubation
   .
   # Contact:  From [**Name (NI) 1337**].  Sister [**Name (NI) 588**] [**Name (NI) 3214**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3215**]
   .
   # Code: Full Code.
   .
   # Dispo: floor later today pending successful extubation
