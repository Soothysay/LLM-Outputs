","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain, which was found to be a result of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for ongoing monitoring. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, but he still has recurrent chest pain and new right bundle branch block (RBBB). 

Medical Complications:
1. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia: The patient has a history of PVD, which is a condition characterized by narrowed or blocked blood vessels outside of the heart and brain. It can lead to decreased blood flow to the limbs and increase the risk of ulcers, infections, and gangrene.
2. Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD): The patient may have an increased risk of developing peptic ulcers due to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief.
3. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient experienced a heart attack, specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This type of heart attack occurs when there is a partial blockage in one of the coronary arteries.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain, and was found to have ST elevations in leads V1/V2 and new right bundle branch block (RBBB). These findings were concerning for an acute myocardial infarction (MI), possibly involving the RCA or LAD coronary artery distribution. 

The patient was transferred to another hospital for cardiac catheterization and admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for ongoing monitoring. His cardiac biomarkers were elevated, consistent with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and heparin. The plan is to continue these medications, along with monitoring the patient's condition closely. 

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease (PVD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), pulmonary edema, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient is also being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO for catheterization, receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and has multiple IV lines placed. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain, and was found to have [Hospital 3650] transferred to [Hospital1 19] for cardiac catheterization and to the CCU for ongoing monitoring due to recurrent chest pain and new right bundle branch block.

The patient sustained a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with lesions likely representing left anterior descending artery distribution. He remained chest pain-free overnight. The plan is for cardiac catheterization today.

The patient is NPO for cath, and will receive mucomyst and bicarb for pre-cath hydration. He will continue on heparin and nitroglycerin. Integrilin has been held, and high-dose statin, aspirin, and low-dose beta-blocker (metoprolol) will be started. The patient's home ACE inhibitor has been held due to acute conduction abnormality. Clopidogrel 75 mg will be continued, and a follow-up lipid panel and HbA1c will be done.

The patient also has evidence of volume overload with bibasilar crackles on exam and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide. The exact ejection fraction is unknown, but the patient was on Lasix as an outpatient. Acute ischemia is suspected as a major contributing etiology. An echocardiogram"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and myocardial infarction (MI). The patient presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, the patient had hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of respiratory distress. Initial laboratory results showed elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac injury. A cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing a 99% occlusion in the left main coronary artery. The patient was started on intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin. The patient's condition stabilized, and he was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate a decreased cardiac output, which can lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation may suggest the development of ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition that occurs as a complication of various illnesses or injuries.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. These clots can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
4. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and use of medical devices can increase the risk of"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain. He was found to have [**Hospital 3650**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization and to the coronary care unit (CCU) for ongoing monitoring due to recurrent chest pain and new right bundle branch block (RBBB).

During the cardiac catheterization, the patient underwent invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring (IABP) placement and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD). The patient was evaluated by a cardiovascular surgeon who agreed to perform coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the patient prefers to have a left main stent placed instead.

The patient remained chest pain-free overnight and was kept nil per os (NPO) for a possible repeat catheterization in the morning. The patient received pre-cath hydration with mucomyst and bicarb, continued heparin infusion, and Integrilin was held due to [**Last Name (un)**]. The patient is also on high-dose statin therapy, aspirin (ASA), low-dose beta-blocker metoprolol, and clopidogrel 75 mg (loaded with 600 mg at OSH).

On the echocardiogram, the patient has a severely depressed systolic ejection fraction of 25-30"

   81 yo male with history of HTN and diabetes who presented to OSH with
   SOB/CP found to have [**Hospital 3650**] transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac cath and
   to CCU for ongoing monitoring in setting of recurrent CP and new RBBB.
   #. CAD:  Pt underwent cardiac cath that showed 3VD.  Patient seen and
   evaluated by CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] who agreed to take pt  for CABG, however, pt would
   prefer to have left main stent placed. Patient remained CP free
   overnight
   - NPO for possible repeat cath this am
   - mucomyst and Bicarb for pre-cath hydration
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - hold Integrilin given [**Last Name (un) **]
   - High dose statin
   - ASA
   - cont low dose BB, metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now in setting of new
   acute conduction abnormality
   - Hold home ACE-I in setting of  [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Continue clopidogrel 75 mg (loaded with 600mg at OSH)

   #. Pump: Severely depressed systolic ejection fraction on ECHO [**6-13**], EF
   25-30%.  Fluid status +300.
   -Monitor I/Os  (even to -500cc negative)
   #. Rhythm: NSR per OSH EKGs. RBB present on old ECG
s so RBBB
   notedcould be rate related.
   - Monitor on telemetry for now.
   - ECG this AM
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Slight improvement in Cr overnight 2

   unclear, however by report pt had some urinary retention at OSH and has
   now improved s/p Foley catheter placement.
   - mucomyst and pre-cath hydration as above.
   - continue to hold ACEi
   - trend SCr
   - pt may require more aggressive BPH regimen once acute issues resolved
   and Foley removed
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   #. Urinary Tract Infection:  Complicated UTI by definition. Received
   one dose IV levofloxacin at OSH yesterday.
   - Ciprofloxacin 500 mg Q24H x 6 additional doses  (renally dosed)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain. He was found to have [**Hospital 3650**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization and monitoring in the critical care unit due to recurrent chest pain and new right bundle branch block. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease. The patient was evaluated by a cardiologist who agreed to take him for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the patient prefers to have a left main stent placed. The patient remained chest pain-free overnight and is currently NPO for a possible repeat catheterization this morning. He will receive pre-cath hydration with mucomyst and bicarb. Heparin infusion will continue, and Integrilin will be held due to the new acute conduction abnormality. High-dose statin, aspirin, and low-dose beta-blocker (metoprolol) will be continued. Home ACE inhibitor will be held. Clopidogrel 75 mg will be continued, loaded with 600 mg at the previous hospital.

The patient has severely depressed systolic ejection fraction on echocardiogram, with an estimated ejection fraction of 25-30%. Fluid status is +300. Monitor I/Os closely, aiming to keep within -500cc negative. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a thin, elderly male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac catheterization, insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) line, and sheath placement. The patient underwent a transthoracic echo showing a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-30%, global hypokinesis, regional akinesis of the inferior wall, distal septum, and apex. There is also a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. The patient has mild pulmonary hypertension and moderate mitral regurgitation. The carotid ultrasound showed less than 40% stenosis bilaterally. Iron studies indicated mild iron deficiency, for which iron supplementation was started. The patient's HbA1c level is 6.9%. The EKG is unchanged. It has been decided to defer coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and proceed with left main stent placement. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently receiving nitroglycerin and heparin infusions, along with other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of cardiac catheterization and the findings on the echocardiogram, there is a potential risk of further cardiac events such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
2. Infection: The presence of yellow, turbid urine with high white blood"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. He was found to have significant coronary artery disease, specifically 90% blockage in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing monitoring. The patient's ejection fraction on echocardiogram is severely depressed at 25-30%. His fluid status is positive by 300 mL. The patient is currently on a regimen of medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, statins, and a high dose beta-blocker. The patient's kidney function is being closely monitored, and he is on a course of ciprofloxacin for a complicated urinary tract infection. His blood sugar levels are running high, and adjustments to his diabetes management plan are being made. The patient also has mild iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency, for which he is receiving supplementation. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to continue in the CCU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's significant coronary artery disease and reduced ejection fraction, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain. He was found to have [**Hospital 3650**] and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization and monitoring in the coronary care unit due to recurrent chest pain and new right bundle branch block.

During the cardiac catheterization, it was found that the patient has 90% blockage in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed, and the patient was evaluated by a cardiothoracic surgeon who agreed to perform coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, the patient prefers to have a left main stent placed instead. The patient remained free of chest pain overnight.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, a high dose statin, and metoprolol. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose level. He also has mild iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency.

The patient's ejection fraction is severely depressed at 25-30%, and his fluid status is positive by 300 mL. He is being monitored closely for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's severely depressed ejection fraction and history of coronary artery disease put him at risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a thin, elderly male who presented with a chief complaint of chest pain. He underwent a successful cardiac catheterization with the placement of a left main stent. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was also placed and remained in overnight. His post-cath check was unremarkable. The patient has no known drug allergies and received various medications, including heparin sodium, famotidine (Pepcid), and others.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some noted below.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 37.1 degrees Celsius and a current temperature (Tcurrent) of 35.9 degrees Celsius. His heart rate (HR) is 63 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranges from 151/36 to 93/35 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,307 mL, including 662 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF), 480 mL of oral intake (PO), and 1,827 mL of total fluids. Total output includes 1,075 mL of blood products, 975 mL of urine, 100 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage, and 1,232 mL of total output. The fluid balance is positive at 452 mL.

Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, maintaining SpO2 at 100%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note.

Physical examination reveals a patient in no apparent distress, with a supple neck and flat neck veins. Cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. S1, S2 sounds are normal, with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No chest wall deformities or abnormal lung sounds are noted.

Abdominal examination reveals a soft abdomen with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. No abdominal bruits are heard. The right groin shows a non-tender IABP in place. Extremity examination is unremarkable, with no femoral bruits or peripheral pulses abnormalities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, while troponin-T levels are elevated. Other lab values are provided but will not be mentioned here.

Assessment and Plan:

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain. He was found to have a blocked left main coronary artery, which was successfully treated with stenting during cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing monitoring due to recurrent chest pain and new right bundle branch block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's severely depressed systolic ejection fraction (25-30%) indicates a weakened heart function. This can lead to further heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease suggest an increased risk of acute kidney injury. This could be due to factors such as contrast-induced nephropathy, medication nephrotoxicity, or decreased renal perfusion.
3. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. There is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Blood Clots: As the patient underwent cardiac catheterization and has been on heparin therapy, there is a risk of developing blood clots, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Anemia: The patient has mild iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency. If left untreated, this can lead to worsening anemia"

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain. He was found to have significant coronary artery disease and underwent a cardiac catheterization with placement of a stent in the left main coronary artery. The patient's intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) remained in place overnight and is being weaned today. His medications include aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and Plavix, and he will restart an ACE inhibitor when his renal function stabilizes.

The patient's ejection fraction is severely depressed at 25-30%, and he is positive for left ventricular dysfunction. The goal is to reduce his fluid status to -500 to -1000 mL today with the use of intravenous lasix as needed. He is currently in sinus rhythm and will continue to be monitored on telemetry for now.

The patient's creatinine levels are elevated at 1.9, with a baseline of 1.6, indicating potential acute kidney injury. His urine electrolytes should be checked, and he should continue to hold ACE inhibitors. Aggressive blood pressure management and avoidance of nephrotoxins are also recommended.

The patient has been prescribed a course of ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which is pansensitive. He will continue taking ciprofloxacin.

The patient's diabetes management includes tight glycemic control with intensive insulin"

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization that showed significant blockage in the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed, and the patient remains in the ICU for further monitoring. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 63 bpm, a blood pressure range of 151/36-93 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including coronary artery disease, anemia, diabetes, a urinary tract infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, troponin T, and C-reactive protein. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal range. 

The patient's plan includes ongoing cardiac monitoring, continued use of heparin, and various medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The patient is also receiving treatment for his anemia, diabetes, and urinary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain, which were found to be related to cardiac issues.
