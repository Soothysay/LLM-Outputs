   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o lady supraventricular tachycardia comes in with shock and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Shock:  Patient is in cardiogenic shock with depressed EF wall motion
   abnormality and decreased cardiac out put.  Physical exam converning
   for vasocontriction on presentation.  Patient also might have septic
   shock complicating her picture.  Most likely source is urosepsis vs
   sepsis secondary to shock bowel.  Also concerning CXR for pneumonia.
   - Broad coverage with Vanc/zosyn/cipro
   - IVF to keep preload up
   - Transfuse to HCT above 30
   - currently on phenylephrine given tachycardia, will start vasopressin
   as next pressor
   - check random cortisol
   - follow up TTE results
   - follow up official radiology reads
   - cycle CE
   - argatraban for coagulopathy
   - appreciate general surgery recs
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure:  Oxygent sats dropped to 60s in ED,
   however unsure how good of a pleth obtained given patient was clamping
   down.  Unclear etiology.  S/p intubation.  CXR concerning for
   developing PNA.
   - Abx as above
   - frequent ABG
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Concern for HIT given recent exposure on [**1-14**]%
   drop in plt since then.  Patient has multiple thrombus including PE,
   arotic/celiac thrombus and most likely emboli leading to splenic
   infarct and ? bowel infarct.  DIC will be lower in the differential.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs, will send for lupus/anticardiolipin Ab
   - Argatraban gtt, titrate to PTT 60-80
   - HIT Ab sent
   - peripheral smear
   - appreciate vascular surgery recs
   .
   # Right Ureteral Stone:  Does not seem like an acute complication.
   - appreciate urology recs
   - broadspectrum Abx as above
   .
   # Decreasing HCT:  Patient was bleeding in left hematoma and small
   jugular hematoma after line attempt.
   - check HCT q6h
   - T and C for 3 units
   - transfuse to HCT above 30
   .
   # Right carotid and left femoral small hematoma:  After attempt of
   central line placment.
   - currently appears stable
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Tachycardia: Afib with RVR.  Seen by cardiology in the past.  Patient
   went into rapid afib with RVRs to 150-160s soon after admission to
   MICU.  Amio bolus converted to sinus but then switched back to AFRVR.
   - currently in sinus
   - continue amio drip to load
   - on argatraban
   - replete lytes prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now; replete lytes prn
   .
   # Prophylaxis:  Agartroban, PPI
   .
   # Access: Right triple lumen femoral, right Aline

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of supraventricular tachycardia who presented with shock and respiratory distress. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, possibly complicated by septic shock. There are concerns about pneumonia and urosepsis as potential sources of infection. The patient's coagulopathy is a concern due to recent exposure to argatroban, a medication used for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She has multiple thrombi including pulmonary embolism, aortic/celiac thrombus, and possible emboli leading to splenic infarct and bowel infarct. DIC is also considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient's right ureteral stone does not seem to be an acute complication. She has decreasing hemoglobin levels due to bleeding in a left hematoma and small jugular hematoma after line attempts. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which is attributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's depressed ejection fraction and wall motion abnormality indicate compromised cardiac output, leading to inadequate perfusion of organs and tissues.
2. Septic shock: Given the presence of fever and suspected infections (pneumonia and urosepsis), there is a risk of sepsis progressing to septic shock, characterized by systemic inflammatory response"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman who presented with supraventricular tachycardia, shock, and respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and may also have septic shock. The likely sources of sepsis include pneumonia or shock bowel, rather than urosepsis. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids to maintain preload, blood transfusions to maintain hemoglobin above 30, and monitoring of urine output.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone but switched back. She is currently in sinus rhythm and will continue on amiodarone. The patient also has a coagulopathy, likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with a significant drop in platelet count. She has multiple thrombi, including pulmonary embolism, arterial/celiac thrombus, and splenic infarct. DIC is lower in the differential. Argatroban has been started for anticoagulation, and HIT antibodies have been sent.

The patient's right ureteral stone does not seem like an acute complication. She has experienced bleeding in the left hematoma and small jugular hematoma after line attempts, leading to decreased hematocrit levels. The patient is NPO for now, with plans to advance enteral nutrition if extubated. Prophylactic measures include argatroban, proton pump inhibitor, and ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle. The patient has two central lines, an arterial line, and is on full code status. She is currently admitted to the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who was admitted with supraventricular tachycardia, shock, and respiratory distress. She is currently in cardiogenic shock with depressed EF and wall motion abnormality, as well as decreased cardiac output. There is also a concern for septic shock, possibly secondary to pneumonia or shock bowel. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has been on amiodarone for it. She has multiple thrombi including pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombus, and splenic infarct, and there is a possibility of bowel infarct. There is also a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) given the recent exposure to heparin and the drop in platelet count. The patient has a right ureteral stone, which does not seem like an acute complication. Her hematocrit (HCT) is decreasing due to bleeding in the left hematoma and small jugular hematoma after line attempts. The patient has small hematomas at the right carotid and left femoral sites after central line placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is already in cardiogenic shock with depressed EF and wall motion abnormality, decreased cardiac output, and vasoconstriction.
2. Septic shock: There is a concern for septic shock complicating her picture, most likely secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and ureteral stone presenting with diffuse thrombi, sepsis, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and ischemic bowel. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and daily reassessment of the source of infection are necessary. Prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's sepsis may cause cardiomyopathy, leading to heart dysfunction. Monitoring cardiac function through echocardiography and ensuring adequate fluid balance and hemodynamic stability are essential.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS or pneumonia. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio and respiratory system compliance, is necessary. Extubation should be considered once the patient demonstrates adequate respiratory effort and gas exchange.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy,"

   the following emphasis and modifications:
    78 year old history of urinary tract infection and stone who presented
   to ED in shock/respiratory failure and ultimately found to have
   pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary
   tract infection.
   Overnight, she continued to have intermittent atrial fibrillation with
   RVR but blood pressure improved and is currently on minimal
   phenylephrine.  Also, weaned down on ventilator and doing well on
   minimal vent settings.

   CXR: bilat effusions, slight bilat infiltrates
   Discussion: Patient with diffuse thrombosus which most likely is
   related to HIT that developed from previous brief hospital course.  She
   likely also has underlying urine infection/urosepsis which may be
   contributing to shock state.
   1)       Shock
 improving (likely combination of
   sepsis/PE[obstructive])
   2)       Acute Respiratory Failure
   3)       Pulmonary Embolism
   4)       Aortic Thrombosus
   5)       Atrial Fibrillation
   Plan:
   1)       Though patient still on minimal vasopressor-support, she
   appears ready for extubation.  As mechanical ventilation can contribute
   to hypotension in pulmonary embolism through ventricular
   inter-dependence and she may have component affected through a. fib, I
   believe extubating on minimal vasopressor is justified in this instance
   2)       Continue Amiodarone for a. fib
   3)       Continue agatroban and follow HIT antibodies
   4)       Continue communication with vascular and general surgery
   though does not seem like intervention needed at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation who presented to the emergency department in shock and respiratory failure. She was found to have a pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary tract infection. Overnight, she continued to have intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but her blood pressure improved and she is currently on minimal phenylephrine. She has been intubated and is awake and alert. Her vital signs include a temperature of 98.6°F, pulse rate of 126 beats per minute (atrial fibrillation), blood pressure of 121/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with 100% oxygen saturation, and oxygen flow rate of 0.4. She has bilateral chest crepitations, slightly distended abdomen, warm extremities, lactate level of 1.2, urine output of more than 50 cc/hour, INR of 4.2, PTT of 80, and bilateral effusions with slight bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient has diffuse thrombi likely related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and underlying urine infection/urosepsis contributing to her shock state. The plan includes extubation on minimal vasopressor support, continuing amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, continuing argatroban and"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o lady supraventricular tachycardia comes in with shock and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Shock:  Patient is in cardiogenic shock with depressed EF wall motion
   abnormality and decreased cardiac out put.  Physical exam converning
   for vasocontriction on presentation.  Patient also might have septic
   shock complicating her picture.  Most likely source is sepsis secondary
   to shock bowel vs pneumonia.  Unlikely to be due to urosepsis.
   - Broad coverage with Vanc/zosyn/cipro
   - IVF to keep preload up
   - Transfuse to HCT above 30
   - monitor UOP
   - currently on phenylephrine given tachycardia, will start vasopressin
   as next pressor if needed
   - random cortisol is normal
   - ruled out for MI
   - argatraban for coagulopathy
   - appreciate general surgery recs
   .
   # S/p intubation:  Oxygent sats dropped to 60s in ED, however unsure
   how good of a pleth obtained given patient was clamping down.  Unclear
   etiology.  CXR concerning for developing PNA.
   - Abx as above
   - compliance is ok, SBT today and attempt extubation
   - sputum culture
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Concern for HIT given recent exposure on [**1-14**]%
   drop in plt since then.  Patient has multiple thrombus including PE,
   arotic/celiac thrombus and most likely emboli leading to splenic
   infarct and ? bowel infarct.  DIC will be lower in the differential.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs, will send for lupus/anticardiolipin Ab
   - Argatraban gtt, titrate to PTT 60-80
   - HIT Ab sent
   - serial fibrinogen
   - peripheral smear
   - appreciate vascular surgery recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Afib with RVR.  Seen by cardiology in the past.  Patient
   went into rapid afib with RVRs to 150-160s soon after admission to
   MICU.  Amio bolus converted to sinus but then switched back to AFRVR.
   - currently in sinus
   - continue amio IV drip to load then switch to PO load 200 mg tid x 1
   week

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who presented with supraventricular tachycardia, shock, and respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, possibly complicated by septic shock. The source of sepsis is likely from the lungs or bowel, rather than a urinary tract infection. The patient has a history of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, arterial/celiac thrombus, and splenic infarct, which raises concerns for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulants such as argatroban. Other issues include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, a right ureteral stone, decreased hematocrit due to bleeding complications, and the need for nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's depressed ejection fraction and wall motion abnormality indicate compromised cardiac output, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ function.
2. Septic Shock: Sepsis secondary to pneumonia or bowel infection may develop, causing systemic inflammation, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and organ dysfunction.
3. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's recent exposure to heparin and subsequent drop in platelet count raise suspicion for HIT, a serious immune-mediated adverse reaction."

","The patient is a 78-year-old female who was admitted with supraventricular tachycardia and shock. The patient presented with cardiogenic shock, characterized by depressed ejection fraction, wall motion abnormality, and decreased cardiac output. There is also a possibility of septic shock, with potential sources including pneumonia or shock bowel, but unlikely to be urosepsis. The patient's hemodynamics have improved overnight, and she is no longer on pressors.

The patient's coagulopathy is a concern due to recent exposure to heparin, resulting in a significant drop in platelet count. There are multiple thrombi present, including pulmonary embolism, aortic/celiac thrombus, and likely emboli leading to splenic infarct and possibly bowel infarct. Asymmetric upper extremity swelling is also observed. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is lower in the differential. 

The patient has a history of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and sinus bradycardia. An amiodarone drip has been completed, and now transitioned to oral amiodarone 200 mg three times a day.

   78 year old history of urinary tract infection and stone who presented
   to ED in shock/respiratory failure and ultimately found to have
   pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary
   tract infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of urinary tract infection and stone who presented to the emergency department in shock and respiratory failure. She was found to have pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary tract infection. The patient continues to have intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but is stable off the ventilator. Her vital signs are within normal range, and she is awake, conversant, and in no acute distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for now.
2. Diffuse thrombi: Suspect heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
   - Continue argatroban.
   - Suspect right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
   - Consider coumadin when all procedures are done.
   - Follow up with platelet factor 4 antibodies.
3. Rapid rhythm: Atrial fibrillation at times.
   - Continue amiodarone for now.
   - Hold off on beta-blockers as just recovering from sepsis.
   - Follow up with electrophysiology recommendations.
4. R UVJ stone: Follow up with urology for stone removal, no evidence of urosepsis.
5. Anemia: Hematomas at prior line sites.
   - Hematocrit stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o lady supraventricular tachycardia comes in with shock.
   .
   # Shock:   Patient was in cardiogenic shock with depressed EF wall
   motion abnormality and decreased cardiac out put.  Physical exam
   converning for vasocontriction on presentation.  Patient also might
   have septic shock complicating her picture.  Most likely source is
   sepsis secondary to shock bowel vs pneumonia.  Unlikely to be due to
   urosepsis.  Her hemodynamics improved overnight and is off of pressors.
   - Broad coverage with Vanc/zosyn/cipro for now, day 1= [**1-27**]
   - f/u cultures, will send for c diff if patient stools
   - IVF prn to keep preload up
   - Transfuse to HCT above 30
   - monitor UOP
   - ruled out for MI
   - argatraban for coagulopathy
   - appreciate general surgery recs
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Concern for HIT given recent exposure on [**1-14**]%
   drop in plt since then.  Patient has multiple thrombus including PE,
   arotic/celiac thrombus and most likely emboli leading to splenic
   infarct and ? bowel infarct.  She now has asymmetric upper extremity
   swelling R > L. DIC will be lower in the differential.
   - appreciate heme/onc recs, sent lupus/anticardiolipin Ab
   - Argatraban gtt, titrate to PTT 60-80
   - consider starting coumadin if there are no procedures planned
   - HIT Ab sent
   - serial fibrinogen
   .
   # Tachycardia: Periods of AVNRT, Afib with RVR and sinus brady.  Seen
   by Electrophysiology in the past.    Finished amio drip and now
   transition to amio 200 tid.
   - amio as above
   - appreciate EP recs
   - on argatraban
   - replete lytes prn
   .
   # S/p extubation:  Oxygent sats dropped to 60s in ED, however unsure
   how good of a pleth obtained given patient was clamping down.  Unclear
   etiology.  CXR concerning for developing PNA.
   - Abx as above
   .
   # Right Ureteral Stone:  Does not seem like an acute complication.
   - appreciate urology recs
   - broadspectrum Abx as above
   .
   # Decreased HCT since admission:  Currently stable around 30s.
   Patient was bleeding in left hematoma and small jugular hematoma after
   line attempts.
   - active T&C
   - transfuse to HCT above 30
   .
   # FEN: advance diet as tolerated; replete lytes prn
   .
   # Prophylaxis:  Agartroban, PPI
   .
   # Access: Right triple lumen femoral, will attempt peripheral IVs and
   if successful remove the line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted with supraventricular tachycardia and cardiogenic shock. She also presents with signs of septic shock, likely secondary to shock bowel or pneumonia. Her hemodynamics have improved and she is off of pressors. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures will be followed up. The patient's coagulopathy is concerning for HIT, with recent exposure and a significant drop in platelet count. There are multiple thrombi present, including a pulmonary embolism, aortic/celiac thrombus, and possible bowel infarct. DIC is also considered in the differential. Fibronogen levels are within normal limits. HIT antibodies have been sent, and antiphospholipid antibodies will be assessed. The patient has been placed on heparin, titrated to PTT 60-80. If there are no planned procedures, Coumadin may be started. The patient has experienced periods of AVNRT and possibly atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Initially, amiodarone was loaded but is now off. Diltiazem has been started in an oral form. Electrolytes will be repleted as needed. The patient underwent extubation, but her oxygen saturation dropped to the 60s, and the etiology is unclear. A chest X-ray is concerning for developing pneumonia. Antibiotics have been continued as previously prescribed. The right ureteral stone"

   78 year old history of urinary tract infection and stone who presented
   to ED in shock/respiratory failure and ultimately found to have
   pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old lady with a complex medical history. She presented to the emergency department in shock and respiratory failure, and was found to have multiple thrombi including pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary tract infection. 

The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but her blood pressure issues have been resolved. She is currently off the ventilator and doing well. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 98.6°F, pulse of 82 beats per minute (sinus rhythm), blood pressure of 127/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Physical examination reveals slight crackles in the bases bilaterally, regular heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and minimal edema. 

The patient has a history of urinary tract infection and stone, and overnight she had intermittent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, her blood pressure issues are resolved. 

The plan includes continuing argatroban and following HIT antibodies, continuing cardizem for atrial fibrillation, transferring to the floor today, and continuing antibiotics though no clear source (possibly urine). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include: 
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which has since resolved.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of urinary tract infection and stone who presented to the emergency department in shock and respiratory failure. She was found to have a pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been receiving treatment for various conditions including cardiogenic and septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and HIT vs. DIC with diffuse thrombi.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic and septic shock: The patient has been receiving treatment for cardiogenic and septic shock, which suggests that she may still be at risk for complications related to these conditions. This includes hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. Complications can include further deterioration of lung function, pulmonary hypertension, and even sudden death.
3. Aortic thrombus: The presence of an aortic thrombus indicates a risk of embolization to other organs, leading to complications such as stroke, kidney failure, or mesenteric ischemia.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
5. HIT vs. DIC with diffuse thrombi: The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocyt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. She received antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) due to sepsis and anticoagulants (argatroban) for possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's vital signs have stabilized, with a heart rate ranging from 60-147 bpm, blood pressure between 76-128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her temperature is within normal range at 36.9°C (98.4°F). The patient's weight has decreased from 70 kg to 60 kg during her stay in the ICU.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,132 mL and output of 2,925 mL since 12 AM, resulting in a negative balance of 1,793 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 28 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 62 mmHg, oxygen"

   I have reviewed and agree with the fellow
s assessment and plan with
   the following emphasis and modifications:
   78 year old history of urinary tract infection and stone who presented
   to ED in shock/respiratory failure and ultimately found to have
   pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary
   tract infection.
   Overnight, she continued to have intermittent atrial fibrillation with
   RVR but blood pressure issues are resolved. Doing fine off the
   ventilator.

   Discussion: Patient with diffuse thrombosus which most likely is
   related to HIT that developed from previous brief hospital course.  She
   likely also has underlying urine infection/urosepsis or pneumonia which
   likely contributed to initial shock presentation and severe hypothermia
   which have now resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who presented to the emergency department in shock and respiratory failure. She was found to have multiple medical issues including pulmonary embolism, aortic thrombus, celiac occlusion, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and cardiac medication. Her condition has improved overnight, with resolution of shock and acute respiratory failure. She is currently in sinus rhythm and off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock - resolved
2. Acute Respiratory Failure - resolved and extubated
3. Pulmonary Embolism - ongoing concern, requires continued anticoagulation therapy
4. Aortic Thrombus - requires ongoing monitoring and consideration for intervention if necessary
5. Atrial Fibrillation - intermittent, currently in normal sinus rhythm, requires continued cardizem for maintenance
6. HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia) - requires continued argatroban and follow-up on HIT antibodies
7. Urinary Tract Infection/Urosepsis - ongoing concern, requires completion of a 10-day course of antibiotics
8. Pneumonia - possible contributing factor to initial shock presentation and severe hypothermia, requires further evaluation and treatment if necessary
