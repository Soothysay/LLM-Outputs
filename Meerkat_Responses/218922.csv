   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female with DM, CHF, cryptogenic cirrhosis, s/p splenectomy,
   undergoing thrombocytopenia w/u with question of ITP, recently admitted
   for BRBPR who represents with GI bleed.
   .
   # GI bleed: 1 episode of dark red stool yesterday.  Likely LGIB rather
   than UGIB absence of frank melena, stable hemodynamics, negative NG
   lavage, and recent unremarkable upper EGD.  Given recent colonoscopy
   finding, most likely etiologies are rectal varices, diverticuli, or
   hemorrhoids. HCT below  baseline (24-27); hemodynamically stable
   without evidence of continued active bleeding.  Scoped this morning
   noted to have rectal varices without active bleeding, hemostasis
   achieved with ethadiol injection.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PIV x 2 for access
   - active type and screen
   - monitor HCT Q8-12hrs
   - Transfuse for Hct <22 (would avoid transfusion to Hct >25 in pt with
   portal hypertension due to risk of rebound bleeding)
   - Octreotide gtt to be continued for next 24 hours
   - transfuse 1unit for HCT of 21
   - Cont home pantoprazole 40mg daily as UGIB unlikely
   - slowly advance diet
   - No need for cipro ppx per Liver team as not UGIB and pt w/o ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Etiology thought to be ITP; plts improving on
   prednisone.  With ITP, pts usually not at increased bleeding risk even
   with markedly decreased plt counts
   - Decrease prednisone to 30mg as recommended by Heme-Onc
   .
   # Thrush: Likely secondary to prednisone.
   - Nystatin S&S qid
   .
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: No signs of encephalopathy. Appears
   compensated.
   - Holding natalol for now, resume if HD stable
   - Appreciate liver recs
   .
   # CRF: At baseline Cr 1.4
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CHF: Nl EF on recent TTE.  Pt with evidence of mild fluid overload
   but breathing comfortably and satting well on room air.  Will give
   lasix with 1 unit of blood this AM.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   - hold home dose lasix for now
   .
   # HTN: Pressures more elevated recently per daughter in setting of
   prednisone.
   - hold antihypertensives for now
   .
   # DM Type II: [**Month (only) 11**] have elevated FSBS in setting of steroids
   - FSG qid with HISS for now
   .
   # S/p fall: CT head w/o evidence of acute path on prelim read.  Pt
   neurologically intact and reportedly with resolving ecchymoses. CT head
   unremarkable.
   - Monitor exam

","The patient is a 89-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and splenectomy. She was admitted for thrombocytopenia workup with a question of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and recently had a gastrointestinal bleed. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient had one episode of dark red stool yesterday, likely lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) rather than upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB). She underwent a colonoscopy which showed rectal varices, diverticuli, or hemorrhoids as possible etiologies. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is below baseline but stable, and there is no evidence of continued active bleeding. Rectal varices were observed without active bleeding during the scope, and hemostasis was achieved with ethadiol injection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), chronic cerebrovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She underwent a thrombocytopenia workup with a question of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and was recently admitted for blood in the stool (BRBPR) who now presents with a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and potentially result in hypovolemic shock if not managed properly.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially with the recent gastrointestinal bleed.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic heart failure, which can be exacerbated by fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Diabetic Complications: The patient has type II diabetes, which can lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease, which can result in further deterioration of renal function and require careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.
6. Cryptogenic Cir"

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female with DM, CHF, cryptogenic cirrhosis, s/p splenectomy,
   undergoing thrombocytopenia w/u with question of ITP, recently admitted
   for BRBPR who represents with GI bleed.
   .
   # GI bleed:.  Likely LGIB rather than UGIB absence of frank melena,
   stable hemodynamics, negative NG lavage, and recent unremarkable upper
   EGD.  Given recent colonoscopy finding, most likely etiologies are
   rectal varices, diverticuli, or hemorrhoids.  Scoped on [**3-10**] noted to
   have rectal varices without active bleeding, hemostasis achieved with
   ethadiol injection.  Patient has remained hemodynamically stable,
   transfused 1unit for HCT 21 with response to 27, has remained stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PIV x 2 for access
   - active type and screen
   - monitor HCT Q8-12hrs
   - Transfuse for Hct <22 (would avoid transfusion to Hct >25 in pt with
   portal hypertension due to risk of rebound bleeding)
   - Octreotide gtt through this AM then D/C
   - Cont home pantoprazole 40mg daily as UGIB unlikely
   - will discuss restart nadolol with liver team
   - slowly advance diet
   - No need for cipro ppx per Liver team as not UGIB and pt w/o ascites
   - f/u liver recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Etiology thought to be ITP; plts improving on
   prednisone.  With ITP, pts usually not at increased bleeding risk even
   with markedly decreased plt counts
   - Decrease prednisone to 30mg as recommended by Heme-Onc
   .
   #Leukocytosis:  Patient afebrile without localizing symptoms of
   infection
   - add on differential
   - UA and CX
   - CXR
   - blood CX
   .
   # Thrush: Likely secondary to prednisone.
   - Nystatin S&S qid
   .
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: No signs of encephalopathy. Appears
   compensated.
   - Holding natalol for now, resume if HD stable
   - Appreciate liver recs
   .
   # CRF: Slowly trending up from baseline of 1.3 to 1.6 today.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CHF: Nl EF on recent TTE.  Pt with evidence of mild fluid overload
   but breathing comfortably and satting well on room air.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   - re-start lasix this AM
   .
   # HTN: Pressures more elevated recently per daughter in setting of
   prednisone.
   - continue amlodipine 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - change captopril to home dose of lisinopril
   .
   # DM Type II: [**Month (only) 11**] have elevated FSBS in setting of steroids
   - FSG qid with HISS for now
   .
   # S/p fall: CT head w/o evidence of acute path on prelim read.  Pt
   neurologically intact and reportedly with resolving ecchymoses. CT head
   unremarkable.
   - Monitor exam
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, clears for now, then NPO in AM for
   flex sig

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a recent splenectomy. She was admitted for thrombocytopenia workup with a question of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and recently experienced a gastrointestinal bleed. 

The patient underwent a colonoscopy which revealed large rectal varices without active bleeding. Hemostasis was achieved with ethiodol injection. She was also transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for a hematocrit (HCT) level of 21, and her vital signs are stable. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent GI bleed, likely lower gastrointestinal (LGIB), may recur if the underlying cause, such as rectal varices, diverticuli, or hemorrhoids, is not fully addressed. Close monitoring and continued management are necessary to prevent further bleeding episodes.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could lead to increased bleeding risk. While the etiology of thrombocytopenia is thought to be ITP and the patient's platelets are improving on prednisone, monitoring and adjustment of treatment are required to maintain platelet levels and prevent bleeding complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo female with DM, CHF, cryptogenic cirrhosis, s/p splenectomy,
   undergoing thrombocytopenia w/u with question of ITP, recently admitted
   for BRBPR who represents with GI bleed.
   .
   # GI bleed:.  Likely LGIB rather than UGIB absence of frank melena,
   stable hemodynamics, negative NG lavage, and recent unremarkable upper
   EGD.  Given recent colonoscopy finding, most likely etiologies are
   rectal varices, diverticuli, or hemorrhoids.  Scoped on [**3-10**] noted to
   have rectal varices without active bleeding, hemostasis achieved with
   ethadiol injection.  Patient has remained hemodynamically stable,
   transfused 1unit for HCT 21 with response to 27, has remained stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PIV x 2 for access
   - active type and screen
   - monitor HCT Q8-12hrs
   - Transfuse for Hct <22 (would avoid transfusion to Hct >25 in pt with
   portal hypertension due to risk of rebound bleeding)
   - follow up with GI regarding Octreotide gtt through this AM then ?
   D/C
   - Cont home pantoprazole 40mg daily as UGIB unlikely
   - will discuss restart nadolol with liver team
   - slowly advance diet
   - No need for cipro ppx per Liver team as not UGIB and pt w/o ascites
   - f/u liver recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Etiology thought to be ITP; plts improving on
   prednisone.  With ITP, pts usually not at increased bleeding risk even
   with markedly decreased plt counts
   - Decrease prednisone to 30mg as recommended by Heme-Onc
   - will need to f/u with Hematology as an outpatient
   .
   #Leukocytosis:  Patient afebrile without localizing symptoms of
   infection
   - add on differential
   - UA and Cx
   - CXR
   - blood Cx
   .
   # Thrush: Likely secondary to prednisone.
   - Nystatin S&S qid
   .
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: No signs of encephalopathy. Appears
   compensated.
   - will restart home nadolol
   - Appreciate liver recs
   .
   # CRF: Slowly trending up from baseline of 1.3 to 1.6 today.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - consider urine lytes
   .
   # CHF: Nl EF on recent TTE.  Pt with evidence of mild fluid overload
   but breathing comfortably and satting well on room air.
   - Monitor I/O, daily weights
   - re-start lasix this AM
   .
   # HTN: Pressures more elevated recently per daughter in setting of
   prednisone.
   - continue amlodipine 5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - change captopril to home dose of lisinopril
   .
   # DM Type II: [**Month (only) 11**] have elevated FSBS in setting of steroids
   - FSG qid with HISS for now
   .
   # S/p fall: CT head w/o evidence of acute path on prelim read.  Pt
   neurologically intact and reportedly with resolving ecchymoses. CT head
   unremarkable.
   - Monitor exam
   - PT consult for home evaluation versus rehab
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, ADAT renal diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Peripherals (18, 20)
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient). HCP is daughter [**Name (NI) 1035**]

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a previous splenectomy. She was admitted for thrombocytopenia workup with a question of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and recently experienced a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed large rectal varices without active bleeding, and hemostasis was achieved with an ethiodol injection. She was also found to have hypertensive blood pressure and was started on medications to control it.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/68 to 193/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Her physical examination revealed ecchymoses over the left orbit, mildly elevated jugular venous pressure, minimal crackles at the lung bases, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, and soft non-tender abdomen without distension or rebound tenderness. The patient has a Foley catheter in place.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 22.0%, platelet count of 107 K/uL, creatinine"
