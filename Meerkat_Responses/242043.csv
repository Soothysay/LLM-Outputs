They have a history of allergies to ace inhibitors and angioedema. The patient is currently on several medications including furosemide, PPI, Lopressor, calcium, vit d, clonidine, asa, pred 5 daily, desmopressin, and levothyroxine.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.1Â°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 119/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation but previously required endotracheal intubation with assisted controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, plateau pressure (Plateau) of 28 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 of 92, HCO3- of 36, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 168.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, clear breath sounds with diminished sounds anteriorly, and warm skin. Neuro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female who was intubated for acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes new infiltrate versus acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF) flare. The patient's current conditions include acute and chronic respiratory failure, acute and chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, obesity-hyperventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, renal dysfunction, and panhypopituitarism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be important to identify and treat any potential infections promptly.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent improvement in renal function suggests that they may be at risk for developing AKI. Monitoring urine output, serum creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances will be crucial to detect and manage any renal dysfunction.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of chronic diastolic congestive heart failure increases the risk of exacerbations. Close monitoring of fluid balance, blood pressure, and signs of volume overload will be necessary to manage this condition effectively.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase levels warrant further investigation into the possibility of pancreatitis. Additional diagnostic tests such as abdominal imaging and pancreatic enzyme levels may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of obesity, who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal bleed, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38Â°C (100.4Â°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 121/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. The patient's condition is being managed with propofol for sedation, diuretics for fluid balance, and antibiotics for infection prophylaxis. The patient is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to high airway pressures.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's congestive heart failure may lead to arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock if not properly managed.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening anemia due to the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female who is intubated for acute-on-chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes new infiltrate versus acute-on-chronic decompensated heart failure flare. The patient has been transitioned from assisted control (AC) to partial support (PS) overnight. The pH goal is between 7.33 and 7.37. Propofol should be weaned, and the patient should be started on Levofloxacin due to a positive sputum gram stain. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's height is 21 inches, and their weight is not mentioned. Fluid balance shows an intake of 956 mL, output of 2,875 mL, and negative balance of -1,969 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including Levofloxacin, prednisone, hydrocortisone, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium. The patient's medical history includes allergies to ACE inhibitors and lisinopril, as well as shortness of breath with lisinopril use. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint includes gram-negative diplococci in the sputum and a gram-negative rod in the urine. They have been started on Levofloxacin to cover these infections. The patient has been stable on pressure support (PS) for most of the day, but agitation returned in the evening, and the plan is to put them back on PS during the night with a possible early morning spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation.

The patient's allergies include Ace inhibitors and angioedema, as well as Lisinopril causing shortness of breath. They have received infusions of Propofol and Lasix, and are on prophylactic Heparin sodium. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/73 to 148/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance of 25 cmH2O/mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female who was intubated for acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes a new lung infiltrate versus an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has been extubated and is now breathing on her own. Her post-extubation carbon dioxide level is 75, which is within the normal range. The goal is to wean off propofol sedation. 

The patient has a positive sputum gram stain with Moraxella, and Levofloxacin has been started empirically while awaiting culture results. There is also a concern for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella, but it is uncertain whether it is colonization or an actual infection. The patient is being treated with Levofloxacin, which is sensitive to the organism. 

The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and is experiencing fluid overload with negative 2 liters of fluid balance overnight. The sodium level is high at 148, so the plan is to allow the patient to drink now that she is extubated and taper down steroids. 

Other conditions present include obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient needs to be evaluated for home BiPap/CPAP settings. There is also a concern for panhypopituitarism, and the patient's steroids"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient diuresed well yesterday and through the evening, and was successfully extubated this morning with acceptable oxygenation on a mask. The post-extubation ABG shows a PaCO2 of 75 with a compensated pH, indicating some respiratory acidosis but the body is compensating by increasing renal excretion of bicarbonate.

The patient has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors and lisinopril, as well as angioedema. They were given Levofloxacin as antibiotics at 12:31 PM. The patient is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and several other medications for different conditions.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7 C (99.9 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/90 mmHg to 116/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds detected.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, is well-nourished, and appears to be overweight or obese. No abnormalities were noted in the eyes, head, ears, nose, or throat. Cardiovascular examination showed a normal point of maximal impulse and S1 and S2 heart sounds, but no murmurs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently extubated and being weaned off propofol. The differential diagnosis includes new infiltrate versus acute on chronic decompensated heart failure flare. The patient has a history of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. She is also being treated for pneumonia caused by Moraxella and a urinary tract infection with Klebsiella. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 148. The plan is to allow the patient to drink now that she is extubated, taper down steroids, and continue with other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute and chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for reintubation.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute and chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, which can worsen if not managed appropriately. This may lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has an ongoing infection caused by Moraxella, which can spread and cause worsening respiratory symptoms.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a Klebsiella infection in her urine, which can lead to sepsis and other systemic complications if not treated effectively.

The patient is also being treated for a possible urinary tract infection with Klebsiella, which is colonization versus infection. Additionally, the patient has diastolic congestive heart failure, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea. She is also being treated for pancreatitis and has hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation support.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of a new infiltrate and positive sputum gram stain suggests a possible pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to further respiratory distress and systemic infection.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The presence of Klebsiella in the urine indicates a possible urinary tract infection. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to sepsis and systemic complications.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure may exacerbate if fluid overload or other cardiac issues are not managed properly.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, anemia, and other medical complications. The patient has a history of allergies to ace inhibitors and lisinopril, as well as previous antibiotic use. They are currently receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, metoprolol, prednisone, valsartan, and others.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.5Â°C (99.5Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/82 to 171/162 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on BiPAP respiratory support and has had desaturations and difficulty synchronizing with the system.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some noted below. They have a past medical history of chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and other conditions. The patient's family history, social history, and relevant past medical history remain unchanged.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. There are no signs of endotracheal or nasogastric tubes, and oral mucosa is moist. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse, blood pressure within normal limits, and a systolic murmur at the base.

Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with no crackles, wheezes, or diminished"

","The patient is a 54-year-old female who is currently admitted to the ICU. She has a history of chronic renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), thrombocytopenia, anemia secondary to blood loss, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with apparent obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, and lower gastrointestinal bleed. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/57 to 156/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on CPAP support with SpO2 between 88-93%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,411 mL with outputs including 1,350 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 1,061 mL via intravenous fluids, and 470 mL of urine. The overall fluid balance is 1,941 mL positive.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 132 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 79 to 147 mg/dL, and sodium level of 148 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with fever of unknown origin, adrenal insufficiency, chronic renal failure, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, obstructive sleep apnea, and lower gastrointestinal bleed. 

The patient's plan includes continuing with CPAP support, monitoring blood pressure and fluid balance, administering medications such as heparin sodium, pantoprazole, furosemide, and D5W, and adjusting treatment plans based on the patient's response."
