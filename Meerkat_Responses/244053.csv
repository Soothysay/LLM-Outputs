   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Shock: Hypovolemic vs Septic shock given history of profuse diarrhea
   and grossly positive UA. Pressure not responsive to fluids arguing
   against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. Also s/p 2U PRBCs in
   ED. Afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC arguing against sepsis but
   she is on max dose levophed with MAPS of 55-60. [**Month (only) 8**] be obstructive (ie
   PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Treat with empiric antibiotics
   - Place A-line
   - Ck SV02 and consider PRBCs if less than 70
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**]. Now with
   ARF in setting of hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN.
   - Ck urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer: sacral mets
   - per ONC
   NSCLC: Respiratory status stable

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presented to the hospital with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. 

Assessment:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hypovolemic or septic shock, given her history of profuse diarrhea and positive urine analysis. Her blood pressure is not responsive to fluids, suggesting that hypovolemia is not the sole cause of hypotension.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has acute worsening of chronic diarrhea, with a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Recent radiation therapy may also be causing radiation colitis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has chronically elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, which could be secondary to infection or malignancy. A urine analysis with more than 50 WBCs is concerning for urinary tract infection (UTI) or urosepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have been elevated since June 15th. Now, she is experiencing acute renal failure in the setting of hypotension, possibly due to prerenal causes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient likely has anion gap acidosis secondary to elevated lactate levels as well as renal failure. There is also a non-gap component secondary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a large presacral pelvic mass eroding the sacrum. She remains bradycardic and hypotensive despite receiving maximum doses of norepinephrine and phenylephrine. Glucagon was given, resulting in marked improvement in pressures. The patient is on multiple infusions, including norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and heparin sodium. She has a history of allergies to Zocor and Flagyl. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 75%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg and fluid balance of 1,944 mL in and 1,383 mL out. Blood products totaling 80 mL have been transfused, with urine output of 80 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of 7.20/42/132/16/-10. Physical examination findings are not provided. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with decreased total carbon dioxide, glucose, and potassium levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN. Urine lytes support this diagnosis.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a medical history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presented with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The initial assessment suggests a hypovolemic vs septic shock, but further evaluation is needed.

The patient's vital signs show bradycardia and hypotension, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60 despite being on maximum doses of norepinephrine and phenylephrine. Glucagon was given, which showed marked improvement in pressures. She has been febrile-free and has chronically elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, making it difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or malignancy.

Laboratory results indicate acute worsening of chronic diarrhea, with a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) requiring oral Flagyl, although there have been no recent antibiotics to support this diagnosis. Recent radiation therapy may be causing radiation colitis. Stool cultures have been sent, and oral Flagyl has been started.

Leukocytosis is noted with a chronically elevated WBC count over the last several weeks, but without bands. It is difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or malignancy. A CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast did not show evidence of inflammation/abscess. Urinalysis with >50 WBCs is concerning for urinary tract infection (UT"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer. She presented with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/43 mmHg to 115/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 75%. The patient's physical examination revealed sinus bradycardia, expiratory wheezes, crackles at the bases, and no cyanosis. The patient has a pelvic mass eroding the sacrum, but no free air or fluid in the abdomen was observed on the CT scan.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 35.1 to 36.0 thousand/mm³, an elevated creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values show hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis with an anion gap.

Plan:

1. Continue intravenous fluid boluses with the goal of maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12.
2. Continue using levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
3. Continue empiric antibiotic therapy, at least"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a medical history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presented with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/43 mmHg to 59/29 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 75%. She is currently on maximum doses of norepinephrine and phenylephrine with little improvement in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Glucagon was given and showed marked improvement in pressures. The patient has allergies to Simvastatin and Metronidazole. Her last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on [**2151-9-1**] at 06:57 PM. She is receiving infusions of norepinephrine and phenylephrine. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 35.1 and 36.0, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.3 and 32, platelet count (Plt) of 195 and 167, creatinine (Cr) of 4.1, 3.9, and 3.9, troponin-T of 0.05, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 14 and 17, glucose of 150, 240, and 331, and other lab values such as CK, CKMB, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's diagnosis includes hypovolemic vs septic shock, acute renal failure, diarrhea, leukocytosis, and anion gap acidosis. The treatment plan involves continuing IV fluids, maintaining goal CVP of 12, continuing levophed for MAP >60, stopping glucagon drip, f/u blood and stool cultures, and considering antibiotics for UTI/urosepsis. The patient also requires an ECHO to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE), and further imaging with contrast should be considered. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count, hypotension, and lack of fever may indicate septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have been elevated since [**6-15**], indicating chronic renal issues. Pre-renal vs. acute tubular necrosis (ATN) should be considered, and urine electrolytes and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) need to be monitored.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's acute worsening of chronic diarrhea may be due to C. difficile infection, radiation colitis, or malignancy involving the bowel. Stool cultures, O&P, and C. difficile testing should be sent. Antibiotics should be avoided unless infection is confirmed.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may be secondary to elevated lactate, renal failure, GI losses, and saline administration. Monitoring of lactate and chem panel is essential.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's chronically elevated WBC count may be secondary to infection or malignancy. Close monitoring of WBC count and fever curve is necessary. Imaging studies may help evaluate for any inflammatory processes.
6. Cervical cancer/NSCLC: The patient has known sacral metastasis. Oncology recommendations and repeat imaging with contrast should be considered.
7. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon administration. Insulin should be adjusted as needed.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored while on pressors, and antihypertensive medications should be held.
9. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: Repletion of electrolytes and IV normal saline (NS) for fluids are necessary.
10. Access: The patient currently has an arterial line and multi-lumen line. Regular monitoring and maintenance of these lines are important.

The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management of potential complications."

   CT scan without contrast
   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
    - onc recs
   - CT repeat as above
   .
   Diabetes:
   - FS QID
   - ISS
   .
   HTN: holding meds while on pressors
   .
   FEN: restart diet, replete lytes, hold off on additional fluids

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presents with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She is currently on pressors (norepinephrine and phenylephrine) and has been diagnosed with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and right ventricular hypokinesis. Her urine output has improved since yesterday. She is also experiencing hyponatremia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels. Cultures are pending, and she has a history of Clostridium difficile infection. The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemic shock, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism, and right heart infarct. Further investigations are planned, including a V/Q scan for pulmonary embolism, head CT prior to initiating anticoagulation, and right heart EKG to evaluate for right heart ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic shock: Due to profuse diarrhea and ongoing fluid losses.
2. Septic shock: Rising white blood cell count and hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Dilated right ventricle, hypokinesis, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and low voltage EKG.
4. Pulmonary embolism: Clinical suspicion due to hypotension, low cardiac"

   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.
   - FS QID
   - ISS
   .
   HTN: holding meds while on pressors
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes, IV NS for fluids

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presented with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient has been receiving treatment for her conditions, including antibiotics, pressors, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and rising white blood cell count may suggest septic shock. However, she appears comfortable on examination and does not have a fever, making this diagnosis less likely.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation raise concerns for cardiogenic shock. However, there is no evidence of right heart strain on EKG, and the patient is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation without difficulty.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is now presenting with acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia or intrinsic renal damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
4. Infectious Colitis: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, and there are concerns about infectious colitis, particularly Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Stool cultures have been sent, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be"

   CT scan without contrast
   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   is likely reason for hyponatremia this morning. This metabolic acidosis
   is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch to IV NS today.
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.
   - FS QID
   - ISS

   HTN: holding meds while on pressors

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presents with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on multiple pressors, including norepinephrine and phenylephrine, to maintain adequate blood pressure. An echocardiogram shows a dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis and elevated pulmonary artery pressures, suggesting possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or right heart infarct.

The patient's urine output has been low, with a FeNa of 0.6% initially, indicating pre-renal etiology. However, a repeat FeNa of 2.3% suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as well. The patient has been treated with IV fluids and sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to gastrointestinal losses and renal failure.

The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Her blood glucose levels have been elevated, but this is expected due to glucagon administration. The patient's WBC count is chronically elevated, making it difficult to determine if it is due to infection or malignancy. A CT abdomen/pelvis did not show evidence of inflammation or abscess.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia. Her current medications include"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female admit with hypotension and bradycardia now with findings
   on ECHO to suggest significant impairment in RV function and
   significant increase in pulmonary artery pressures noted (mod PAH and
   TR).  This in in the setting of persistent bradycardia suggesting
   possible RV vascular distribution ischemia.  In addition the elevations
   in pulmonary artery pressure remain to be defined in regards to
   source.  Finally--she retains a significant bandemia in the setting of
   elevated WBC count.
   The source of persistent hypotension seems in large part to be driven
   by cardiac compromise (high BNP, ECHO findings) in the setting of
   persistent bradycardia
perhaps increased RV afterload and difficulty
   with maintenance of effective CO with increased demand in the setting
   of likely systemic infection with possible urinary source as evidenced
   by the elevated WBC count and bandemia.  GI source with diarrhea
   suspected but diarrhea not clearly confirmed.  The current source of
   the elevated PA pressures in the setting of preserved LV function
   remains to be defined.
   1)Shock-
   Vasodilatory Component-
   -CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff
   -Neosynephrine/Levophed continue and hope to wean
   -Cultures pending
   Cardiogenic Component-
   -Possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as
   well
would like to treat for possible PE and favor treatment if we can
   find reassurance that bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT negative
   for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive
   -Bradycardia persistent, BNP is up, do not see evidence of acute MI on
   findings thus far
mild elevations in enzymes have decreased and may be
   evidence of remote insult or current area at risk
   -Favor change to IV Beta specific agonists for support
with Dopamine
   representing reasonable compromise as with fixed and impaired RV stroke
   volume and peripheral beta effects Dobutamine represents a second
   choice.
   -LV function is preserved
   Hypovolemia-
   -Has been resolved with UVF to the point of likely volume overload
   2)Bradycardia-
   -Telemetry
   -Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors
   -Will look to RV leads to help assure no ongoing insult in the setting
   of stable enzymes
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likley ATN
   -Continue support of BP
   FeNa=low and poor perfusion but now evolving a process consistent with
   ATN

","The patient is a 67-year-old female who was admitted with hypotension and bradycardia. The echocardiogram revealed significant impairment in right ventricular (RV) function and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). The patient also has an increased pulmonary artery pressure, which is not fully explained. There is evidence of systemic infection with possible urinary source, as indicated by the elevated white blood cell count and bandemia. The source of infection is suspected to be gastrointestinal, but this has not been confirmed.

The patient's hypotension is primarily driven by cardiac compromise, possibly due to increased RV afterload and difficulty maintaining cardiac output. There is also a concern for septic shock, possibly with a urinary source, as well as cardiogenic shock due to possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's persistent bradycardia and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels suggest RV ischemia and heart failure.

The patient is currently receiving vasodilatory support with phenylephrine and norepinephrine, as well as inotropic support with dopamine. The goal is to wean off the vasopressors and provide hemodynamic stability. The patient's RV function is preserved, but there is evidence of acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's current ICU care includes nutritional support through a po diet of clears and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female admit with hypotension and bradycardia now with findings
   on ECHO to suggest significant impairment in RV function and
   significant increase in pulmonary artery pressures noted (mod PAH and
   TR).  This in in the setting of persistent bradycardia suggesting
   possible RV vascular distribution ischemia.  In addition the elevations
   in pulmonary artery pressure remain to be defined in regards to
   source.  Finally--she retains a significant bandemia in the setting of
   elevated WBC count.
   The source of persistent hypotension seems in large part to be driven
   by cardiac compromise (high BNP, ECHO findings) in the setting of
   persistent bradycardia
perhaps increased RV afterload and difficulty
   with maintenance of effective CO with increased demand in the setting
   of likely systemic infection with possible urinary source as evidenced
   by the elevated WBC count and bandemia.  GI source with diarrhea
   suspected but diarrhea not clearly confirmed.  The current source of
   the elevated PA pressures in the setting of preserved LV function
   remains to be defined.
   1)Shock-
   Vasodilatory Component-
   -CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff
   -Neosynephrine/Levophed continue and hope to wean
   -Cultures pending
   Cardiogenic Component-
   -Possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as
   well
would like to treat for possible PE and favor treatment if we can
   find reassurance that bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT negative
   for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive
   -Bradycardia persistent, BNP is up, do not see evidence of acute MI on
   findings thus far
mild elevations in enzymes have decreased and may be
   evidence of remote insult or current area at risk
   -Favor change to IV Beta specific agonists for support
with Dopamine
   representing reasonable compromise as with fixed and impaired RV stroke
   volume and peripheral beta effects Dobutamine represents a second
   choice.
   -LV function is preserved
   Hypovolemia-
   -Has been resolved with UVF to the point of likely volume overload
   2)Bradycardia-
   -Telemetry
   -Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors
   -Will look to RV leads to help assure no ongoing insult in the setting
   of stable enzymes
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likley ATN
   -Continue support of BP
   FeNa=low and poor perfusion but now evolving a process consistent with
   ATN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female admitted with hypotension and bradycardia. The patient's condition suggests significant impairment in right ventricular (RV) function and increased pulmonary artery pressures. The elevated pulmonary artery pressures remain to be defined in regards to their source. 

The patient also retains a significant bandemia in the setting of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, indicating a possible systemic infection with a possible urinary source. Additionally, the patient has gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, which are suspected but not clearly confirmed. 

The current source of the elevated pulmonary artery pressures in the setting of preserved left ventricular (LV) function remains to be defined. 

The patient's treatment plan includes managing shock, addressing bradycardia, and treating acute renal failure. The patient is receiving vasodilatory support with CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff), as well as norepinephrine/Levophed for continued support of blood pressure. Cultures are pending. 

The patient is also being treated for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), with a consideration for thrombolytic therapy if a PE is confirmed and if the bleeding risk is deemed reasonable. The patient's persistent bradycardia is being managed with telemetry, inotropic, and chronotropic support for pressors. 

Furthermore, the patient's acute renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx

   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer. She presents with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension that is not responsive to intravenous fluids. Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection or malignancy. The patient also has an elevated lactate level, suggesting possible septic shock. She has been on maximum doses of levophed and phenylephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure.

Assessment and Plan:
The differential diagnosis for the patient's hypotension includes hypovolemic shock, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. Given the findings of a dilated right ventricle on echocardiogram and elevated pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary embolism (PE) is also a consideration. The patient is currently on dopamine for chronotropic and ionotropic effects.

Additional tests and treatments are planned, including a V/Q scan to look for evidence of PE, a head CT prior to initiation of anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease, a right heart EKG to evaluate for right heart ischemia, stool culture, sputum culture, repeat urine analysis, and monitoring of fever curve and WBC count.

The patient's chronic elevated WBC count may be secondary to infection or malignancy. She has evidence of acute renal failure, with an"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation diarrhea was thought to be
   the etiology of her hypotension but the patient has not had any BMs
   since admission. Her other cultures are pending, with urine growing
   E.coli pan-sensitive to current abx. She has remained afebrile, with
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider
   PE, however V/Q scan showed low probablility. Also on the differential
   diagnosis is right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the
   setting of what appears to be bradycardia.  Patient is now off pressors
   but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - cont ceftriaxone for E.coli UTI
   -d/c flagyl as unlikely c.diff
   - f/u pending cultures
   - off pressors now but may need to restart if not fluid responsive
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. Urine ctx with E.coli which
   may have caused sepsis? Blood cultures still pending.  Also CBC today
   with decreased plt, WBC and hematocrit.  [**Month (only) 8**] be drug related (ie. HIT-
   thrombocytopenia).
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   -repeat CBC
   -if hct is decreased consider guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Her initial FeNa 0.6% which supported
   pre-renal etiology; on repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   -consult renal
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Monday ask lab to spin urine
   Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia despite high CVP (pt has
   TR which can falsely elevate CVP measurements). Will continue to
   support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed. [**Month (only) 8**] need to
   give NaHCO3 as well to increase bicarb while ATN resolves.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
    - onc recs
   - CT repeat as above

","The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presented with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's initial vital signs showed hypotension and low urine output. Laboratory results indicated an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies revealed a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated pulmonary artery pressures, suggesting the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) or right heart infarct. However, a V/Q scan showed low probability for PE.

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest the possibility of septic shock due to an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), but she appears comfortable on examination. The patient was initially on maximum doses of vasopressors (levophed and phenylephrine) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 55-60 mmHg, but is now off pressors while still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypovolemic vs septic shock, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis, and possible right heart infarct. She also has a history of diabetes and hypertension, for which her medications have been held while on pressors.

The patient's current plan includes monitoring her fever curve and WBC count, continuing cef"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and confusion. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, chills, and hypotension. On admission, the patient was hypotensive and required aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.

In the ICU, the patient's condition initially improved with stabilization of vital signs and resolution of hypotension. However, over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced a decline in renal function, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels from 1.2 to 1.6 mg/dL. Additionally, the patient developed muddy brown casts in his urine, which are indicative of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A renal consult was obtained, and further investigations such as LDH, schistocytes, FeNa, and repeat renal ultrasound are planned.

The patient also has a left-sided hydrophobia, and a urology consult was requested. There is a possibility of placing a stent to relieve the obstruction.

The patient has allergies to Simvastatin and Metronidazole. He received a total of 10 doses of Metronidazole and 3 doses of Ceftriaxone in the past 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs are stable,"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation diarrhea was thought to be
   the etiology of her hypotension but the patient has not had any BMs
   since admission. Her other cultures are pending, with urine growing
   E.coli pan-sensitive to current abx. She has remained afebrile, with
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider
   PE, however V/Q scan showed low probablility. Also on the differential
   diagnosis is right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the
   setting of what appears to be bradycardia.  Patient is now off pressors
   but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - cont ceftriaxone for E.coli UTI
   -d/c flagyl as unlikely c.diff
   - f/u pending cultures
   - off pressors now but may need to restart if not fluid responsive
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. Urine ctx with E.coli which
   may have caused sepsis? Blood cultures still pending.  Also CBC today
   with decreased plt, WBC and hematocrit.  [**Month (only) 8**] be drug related (ie. HIT-
   thrombocytopenia).
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   -repeat CBC
   -if hct is decreased consider guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Her initial FeNa 0.6% which supported
   pre-renal etiology; on repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   -consult renal
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Monday ask lab to spin urine
   Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia despite high CVP (pt has
   TR which can falsely elevate CVP measurements). Will continue to
   support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed. [**Month (only) 8**] need to
   give NaHCO3 as well to increase bicarb while ATN resolves.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
    - onc recs
   - CT repeat as above
   .
   Diabetes:
   - FS QID
   - ISS
   .
   HTN: holding meds while on pressors

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently in the ICU for shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. Her vital signs show hypotension and bradycardia. The patient has not had any bowel movements since admission. Blood cultures are pending, with urine growing E.coli that is sensitive to current antibiotics. The patient is off pressors but still maintaining a low mean arterial pressure (MAP). She has a dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis on echo, elevated pulmonary artery pressures, and a low probability V/Q scan. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism, right heart infarct, and septic shock. The patient has leukocytosis, decreased platelet count, and a decreased hematocrit. She also has acute renal failure with an initial creatinine level of 1.5-2, indicating chronic renal damage. The patient's sodium levels are low, and she has hyponatremia. She also has anion gap acidosis likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and cervical cancer with sacral metastasis. She is DNR/DNI and currently on ICU care.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypotention: To date unclear exactly why patient continues to be
   hypotensive. Septic shock at this point is unlikely given negative
   cultures, down trending WBC and no fevers. Cardiogenic and obstructive
   shock have been ruled out. Distributive shock is not consistent with
   presentation and clinical exam. Cortisol and TSH labs were appropriate
   and did not support adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. Patient is
   now off pressors but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping. There
   is question of autonomic dysfunction secondary to diabetes or
   chemotherapy treatments in the past. She has known neuropathy which
   could support this theory.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - d/c ceftriaxone as last UCx negative
   - check orthostasis
    - f/u pending cultures
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission. WBC has continued to trend downward.
   Given leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia would consider a transient
   viral infection which may have caused her fever, white count and
   diarrhea, and caused her decompensation.  Also noted is a drop in her
   hematocrit over the last two days. It has actually trended down towards
   her baseline but will guaiac stools and trend CBC to be safe.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - follow pending cultures
   - repeat CBC
   - guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Renal consult noted muddy brown casts on
   urine, recommended to check LDH, schistocytes, FeNa and repeat renal US
   on Monday. Urology is also following and found L sided hydroureter on
   imaging. Debating whether intervention is necessary and is playing any
   role in her ATN (? Why isn
t other kidney picking up the slack?)
   -Renal US tomorrow
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -follow pending labs and smear
   -f/u any new renal and urology recs
   Hyponatremia: Resolved since admission and NS fluid boluses. Will
   continue to support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Resolved since admission.
   - follow chemistry
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations.
   - onc recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She presents with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. Despite being off pressors, she continues to have low mean arterial pressure (MAP) while sleeping. There is a possibility of autonomic dysfunction due to diabetes or chemotherapy treatments. The patient has known neuropathy, which supports this theory.

The patient has leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and a drop in hematocrit over the last two days. These findings suggest a transient viral infection that may have caused her fever, white count, and diarrhea, leading to her decompensation. The patient's baseline creatinine levels are 1.5-2 since June 15th, indicating chronic renal insults secondary to hypertension and diabetes, increasing the risk of further renal damage.

Renal consult noted muddy brown casts in the urine, recommending to check lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), schistocytes, fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), and repeat renal ultrasound on Monday. Urology also found a left-sided hydroureter on imaging, and the necessity of intervention is being debated. It is unclear why the other kidney is not compensating for the damage.

The patient's hyponatremia has resolved since admission with normal saline (NS) fluid boluses. Maintenance fluids IV NS and bol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, who presented with worsening diarrhea, E. coli urinary tract infection, and hypotension. She is currently in the ICU and has received fluid resuscitation to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The hypotension workup has not identified another cause for the shock, and the patient is on appropriate antibiotics for the UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine levels and the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This could be due to sepsis, hypotension, or obstruction caused by the cervical cancer.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to require intermittent fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP above 60, suggesting ongoing hypotension. This may be due to septic shock or other underlying causes that need to be investigated further.
3. Pleural Effusion: The imaging shows a right pleural effusion, which could be related to the underlying malignancy or infection. This may require further evaluation and management.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's worsening diarrhea should be addressed, and the cause needs to be identified. It could be due to the antibiotics, underlying infection, or malignancy.
5. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Although not"

   Patient seen
 present for key portions of history and exam. Agree
   substantially with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1251**]
s assessment and plan.  She has continued to
   improve and is now alert, with HR in 50-60 range and BP has returned to
   baseline.  Creat remains elevated and with evidence of hydronephrosis
   plan is to proceed directly to nephrostomy.  Pain is relatively well
   controlled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. He presented to the ICU with hypotension, shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, with a blood pressure of 108/35 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is off pressor support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The etiology of the hypotensive episode is unclear, but the patient is now off pressor support.
   - IV fluids for decreased urine output or mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60.
   - Follow-up cultures.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis this morning with a white blood cell count of 26.3 from 19 yesterday. The cause is uncertain at this time, but the patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI).
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Continue ceftriaxone.
   - Follow-up cultures.

3. UTI: The patient's urine culture showed E. coli that is pan-sensitive. Repeat urine cultures are negative.
   - Continue ceftriaxone.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a baseline"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer. He presented with hypotension and was found to have shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The etiology of the hypotensive episode is unclear, and the patient has been taken off pressor support. The patient also has leukocytosis, which could be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), but cultures have been negative. He has a history of UTI since [month], and he is currently being treated with ceftriaxone. The patient has been diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and moderate left-sided hydronephrosis. His hyponatremia has resolved since admission, and he no longer requires IV fluids for this condition. The patient's anion gap acidosis has also resolved, likely secondary to lactic acidosis and renal failure. He has known sacral metastases from cervical cancer. His oral anti-hypertensives have not been restarted since he was off pressors. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is being managed with insulin sliding scale (ISS) and blood glucose checks. The patient's disposition will be discussed today."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. He presents with hypotension, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The hypotension has been attributed to an unclear etiology, and the patient is currently off pressor support. The patient also exhibits leukocytosis, likely due to an infection, but cultures have been negative and no fever is present. He has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's condition includes anion gap acidosis, which has resolved since admission, as well as hyponatremia, which has also resolved. His cancer is progressing with known sacral metastases. The patient's current treatment plan includes renal consultation for acute tubular necrosis (ATN), monitoring of electrolytes and renal function, and management of his oncology condition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's renal function, development of further electrolyte imbalances, infection due to immunosuppression from cancer and treatment, and potential complications from ongoing management of his cancer."
