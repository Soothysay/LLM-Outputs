","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with hematemesis and has been admitted to the ICU. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) reveals grade 4 esophagitis at the gastroesophageal junction, along with gastritis and duodenitis. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2.5 liters of intravenous fluids (IVFs). There is a consideration for dialysis, and urology recommends an urgent add-on for tomorrow morning's retrograde urogram and cystoscopy. Anesthesia evaluated the patient overnight. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [date] at 03:45 PM. Pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion started on [date] at 03:45 PM. Other ICU medications are also being administered. There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   # Hematemesis: Patient has had 4 days of hematemesis. Never had this
   before. Given alcohol history this may be gastritis. No known prior
   liver disease, so varices less likely. NG lavage yielded 0.6L of coffee
   ground emesis, so this is unlikely to be hemoptysis. Coags within
   normal limits. HCT currently 40, however this is likely
   hemoconcentrated as patient is anuric.

   #  Acute renal failure: Cr 15.5, baseline 1.0. Likely prerenal from
   above hematemesis. Electrolytes within normal limits. Not fluid
   overloaded. Hypochloremia likely secondary to vomiting. Foley placed in
   ED. No history of BPH or prostate cancer. Patient was hypotensive in
   ED, and received 2L IV fluids. CK 7399. Rhabdomyolysis likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, anuria for four days, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including severe esophagitis, acute renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypotension, elevated lipase, alcohol abuse, hypertension, chronic pain, depression, and potential complications such as rhabdomyolysis and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's hematemesis indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be caused by severe esophagitis or gastritis. This can lead to significant blood loss and may require blood transfusions.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which can be caused by hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding. This condition requires immediate medical intervention to restore renal function.
3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap, indicating metabolic acidosis. This can be a result of lactic acidosis due to poor tissue perfusion or other underlying conditions. Treatment involves correcting the underlying cause and managing acid-base imbalance.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be secondary to hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.

","The patient's chief complaint is hematemesis, or vomiting of blood. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with nausea, vomiting, anuria (no urine output) for four days, and acute renal failure. 

On endoscopy (EGD), severe esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis were found. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2.5 liters of intravenous fluids (IVFs). The patient's hemoglobin concentration stabilized.

The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 15.5 on admission, which decreased to 11.1 this morning. This is likely prerenal due to the hematemesis. Electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is hypochloremia likely secondary to vomiting. Foley catheterization was performed, and urology consultation was requested overnight to evaluate for obstruction. Renal consultation recommended dialysis today or tomorrow.

The patient's blood pressure is resolving, and IV fluids were given to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. Renal and GI consultations are ongoing.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and will require a social work consult once stabilized. If the patient becomes hypertensive, agitated, or tachycardic, consider CIWA scale assessment.

Elevated lipase levels were noted, but the patient no longer has epigastric pain, making fulmin"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with symptoms of hematemesis (vomiting blood), nausea, poor oral intake, and anuric renal failure. The patient underwent a gastrointestinal endoscopy which revealed severe esophagitis. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, indicating acute renal failure, as well as elevated levels of CK, lipase, and liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is hypotensive. Imaging revealed an echogenic right kidney with a possible hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to acute blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding and poor oral intake. Immediate interventions include administering IV fluids, PRBC transfusion, and monitoring for sepsis or cardiogenic etiologies.

2. Hematemesis: The patient has severe esophagitis with no active bleeding. Treatment includes providing active tissue and suctioning, transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain hematocrit above 28, and administering IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and sucralfate.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 15.5 from a baseline of 1.0, indicating an acute renal failure. This is likely due to prerenal causes such as hematemesis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, who presents with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, poor oral intake, and anuric renal failure. The patient has undergone a gastrointestinal endoscopy, which revealed severe esophagitis but no active bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 to 71/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and packed red blood cells as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure above 55 mmHg. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes, as well as elevated cardiac enzymes and lipase levels. Imaging reveals an echogenic right kidney consistent with underlying medical renal disease, and a possible hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst in the right kidney that may represent a neoplasm. The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, likely due to acute blood loss from GI bleeding and poor oral intake. The patient is being managed with large-bore peripheral intravenous lines, intravenous fluids, and packed red blood cells as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 55 mmH"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, poor oral intake, and anuric renal failure. He has been diagnosed with severe esophagitis, likely due to acute blood loss from GI bleeding and poor oral intake. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a creatinine level of 15.5 (from a baseline of 1.0), indicating acute renal failure. There are concerns about potential obstruction caused by a cyst seen on ultrasound. The patient's elevated CK level suggests a possible component of rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, the patient has elevated lipase levels, which does not appear to be fulminant pancreatitis. Other findings include elevated liver function tests, likely due to alcohol abuse, and a need for social work consultation. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids and packed red blood cells to maintain adequate blood pressure and hemodynamic stability. Further evaluation and management are planned, including imaging studies, consultations with GI and renal specialists, and consideration for hemodialysis."

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU due to hematemesis and anuria. He is currently in the ICU green service for a cystoscopy to evaluate for obstruction, as a large cyst in his functional kidney was found on renal US. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/70 to 128/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals mild chronic back pain, occasional expiratory wheeze, non-tender abdomen with distension, and no lower extremity edema. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. There are also elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T), liver enzymes (ALT, AST), amylase, lipase, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and calcium levels.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse who presented with hematemesis and anuria. He was transferred from MICU green service for a cystoscopy to evaluate for obstruction. The patient has a large cyst in his functional kidney, as shown by renal US. The plan is to perform cystoscopy to rule out obstruction. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/70 to 128/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

The patient is receiving pantoprazole, sucralfate, and CIWA scale with ativan. His pain is described as mild and located in the chronic back region. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, chronic back pain, and other unchanged medical, social, and family history. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild pain. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 7,824 mL and total output of 1,234 mL, resulting in a balance of 6,590 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, and his urine output is 534 mL. 

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 95%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and HCO3- of 94 mEq/L. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished, with normal heart sounds, peripheral pulses, respiratory chest examination, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and plan include renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, COPD exacerbation, alcohol abuse, and ICU care. The patient is being monitored for fluid status, receiving bronchodilators, and will undergo cystoscopy to rule out obstruction. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, exacerbation of COPD, gastrointestinal bleeding, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms."

","Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, anuria for four days, and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, acute renal failure, hematemesis, anion gap metabolic acidosis, alcohol abuse, elevated liver function tests, elevated lipase, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to inadequate organ perfusion, which can result in organ dysfunction or failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with IV fluids are essential to maintain adequate perfusion.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is indicated by an elevated creatinine level from 1.0 to 15.5, suggesting impaired kidney function. This can progress to chronic renal failure if not promptly addressed. Appropriate management includes maintaining adequate fluid balance, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, and addressing the underlying cause of renal failure.

3. Hematemesis: The patient's history of severe esophagitis suggests a potential risk for further bleeding or rebleeding episodes. Close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial to prevent complications.

4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis requires careful management to correct the acid-base imbalance. Identifying and treating"

   52 yo M with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with hematemesis,
   nausea, vomiting, anuria x4 days, and acute renal failure.
   .
   # Hypotension: Secondary to hematemesis, hypovolemia. Improved. Has not
   needed pressors
   - IV fluids until MAPs>55
   - hold home morphine until persistently stable
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 15.5, baseline 1.0, now improviing to 11.
   Electrolytes within normal limits. Not fluid overloaded. Hypochloremia
   likely secondary to vomiting. Foley placed in ED.  Patient was
   hypotensive in ED, and received 2L IV fluids. CK 7399. Rhabdomyolysis
   and pre-renal/hypotension likely contributing to ARF.
   -IV fluids to keep MAPs>55
   -repeat chem 10
   -foley catheter
   -Renal consulted -f/u recs: check ABG, serum osms, SPEP, UPEP, C3, C4.
   - appreciate urology reccs: to OR today for cystopscopy
   -trend CK

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, anuria for four days, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with hypotension improving and acute renal failure showing improvement in creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension was likely secondary to hematemesis and hypovolemia. It is important to continue IV fluids to maintain adequate blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has a significantly elevated creatinine level of 15.5 (baseline 1.0), indicating acute renal failure. Electrolytes are within normal limits, and there are no signs of fluid overload. Hypochloremia is likely secondary to vomiting. The Foley catheter has been placed, and renal consultation has been requested.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK level of 7399 suggests rhabdomyolysis. This condition, along with pre-renal or hypotension, is likely contributing to acute renal failure. IV fluids should be continued to keep MAPs >55, and the patient's CK levels should be trended.

4. Hematemesis: The patient initially presented with severe esophagitis, but this has now resolved. Active tissue"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, anuria for four days, and acute renal failure. 

The patient has been receiving treatment for various conditions including acute renal failure, hematemesis, alcohol abuse, elevated liver function tests, hypertension, chronic pain, and depression. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/56 mmHg to 146/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. 

The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and rales at the bases of the lungs, especially on the right side. There is no evidence of leg edema. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, slightly low potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The WBC count is within normal range, while the platelet count is slightly low. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, pulmonary edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, especially in terms of fluid balance, renal function, and respiratory status."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute renal failure and hypoxia. They have been admitted to the ICU and have shown improvement with continued volume replacement for renal failure and diuretics for congestive heart failure. The patient also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but their hemoglobin levels remain stable. They are currently tolerating clear liquids and may be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. This condition can progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed. Complications may include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's hypoxia is attributed to congestive heart failure, which can worsen if not adequately managed. Complications may include pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, there is a risk of rebleeding or ongoing blood loss from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Complications may include anemia, hemorrhagic shock, and malnutrition.
4. Venous Thromboembolism (DVT/Pulmonary Embolism): Critically ill patients have an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs (DVT) or lungs (PE). If not prevented, these cl"
