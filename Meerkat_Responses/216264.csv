   Assessment and Plan
 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 SIRS
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   with recent broad spectrum antibiotic courses Pseudomonal UTI [**6-2**] and
   R foot infection [**7-2**] now presenting with suprapubic pain, low grade
   fever, leukocytosis and hypotension.
   Multiple bloodstream infections withpacemaker/ICD involvement and
   multiple pseudomonal urinary tract infections now with resolved
   abdominal pain and vomiting and labs suggestive of pyuria and urinary
   tract infection/pyelonephritis, with CT showing  stones.
   # SIRS - WBC down to 12.3 from 19 on admission. Leading etiology source
   of infection UTI given +ve UA on admission. Other sources to be
   considered include R foot ulcer (seems no concern for osteomyelitis,
   foot not imaged), BSI, no evidence on PNA on CXR. Also has hx resistant
   GP and GN infections. Currently has Bcx x4 pending, and Ucx pending.
   On day 2 of meropenem(chosen based on previous urine cultures with rise
   in MIC of cefepime and zosyn). In past had hx VRE, MRS, may need
   daptomycin (600qd) as GNR more likely source would DC if blood cultures
   negative at 48 hrs. ID consulted, recommended continued [**Last Name (un) 430**](500qd) and
   dapto (600qd) pending further Cx info.
   Mixed venous 02 (91-96), lactate 2.1 on admission, down to 1.3
   -f/u blood cx. Currently has Bcx x4 pending, and Ucx pending.
   -per ID,continue [**Last Name (un) 430**](500qd) and dapto (600qd) pending further Cx info.
   -No cdiff sent yet ***no stool, f/u given hx of abx use, send c.diff.
    -continue to trend lactate, monitor mixed venous 02 (91-96% today).
   Hypotension: Thought SIRS although cardiogenic given low EF and
   hypovolemic given initial q RPBleed (but WWP) also considered
   initially. Currently MAPS in mid to high 60s, 90s systolic on
   admission. Had CVL placed.
   Potentially related to infection? Levophed ever?
   INR 6.7 on admission, down to 3.3, after 4*** units FFP.
   Concern for retroperitoneal bleed got CT, no retroperitoneal bleed, and
   remains guiac neg.
   Continue [**Hospital1 **] HCT  checks, with coags.
   - Holding antihypertensives including metoprolol, lisinopril and
   spironolactone
   - INR currently still supratherapeutic, however consider heparin GTT
   given mechanical MVR once INR <3 to bridge to coumadin. On 4-6mg
   coumadin at home.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation
   -EKG today****
   - Holding antihypertensives as above given hypotension
   - Holding diuretics while volume repleting

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent pacemaker placement and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infections, recent broad-spectrum antibiotic courses for pseudomonal urinary tract infection and right foot infection, now presenting with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient has a history of multiple bloodstream infections with pacemaker/ICD involvement and multiple pseudomonal urinary tract infections. The patient is currently being treated for suspected urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, with CT showing stones.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): The patient's WBC count has decreased from 19 on admission to 12.3, indicating a potential improvement in the inflammatory response. However, the patient still shows signs of infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Further evaluation and management are required.
2. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient has a history of multiple pseudomonal urinary tract infections and is currently being treated for suspected urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis. The presence of stones in the urinary tract may contribute to recurrent UTIs.
3. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent pacemaker implantation, and multiple bloodstream infections. The patient presented with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. He also had acute hypoxia after eating, new bilateral crackles on chest examination, and evidence of flash pulmonary edema on imaging. The patient responded to treatment with morphine, Lasix, nitroglycerin drip, and nebulizers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which may worsen due to immobility in the ICU.
2. Diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1: The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes, and tight glycemic control is essential to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
3. Pain control: The patient requires adequate pain management for acute and chronic pain.
4. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and presents with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection, including sup"

   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   with recent broad spectrum antibiotic courses Pseudomonal UTI [**6-2**] and
   R foot infection [**7-2**] now presenting with suprapubic pain, low grade
   fever, leukocytosis and hypotension.
   .
   # SIRS - WBC elevated to 19. He was multiple potential sources of
   infection including UTI, R foot ulcer s/p debridement and BSI. No
   evidence of PNA on CXR and cough at patient's baseline. Also consider
   C. diff given multiple recent broad spectrum courses of antimicrobials.
   The patient is at high risk for resistant GP and GN organsisms given
   history. Urine appears most likely source at this time given WBC, nit
   and leuks in UA. He does not have chronic indwelling foley. No evidence
   of cardiac event or additional source of leukocytosis. BP dropped to
   systolic 80s in ED, currently responsive to IVF boluses. Also consider
   source of bleeding given elevated INR, guaiac negative in ED.
   - Continue IVF boluses for goal MAP>65, will add levophed if BP not
   rapidly volume responsive
   - Place CVL for volume repletion and CVP measurement
   - Based on previous Urine cultures with rise in MIC of cefepime and
   zosyn, would use meropenem pending further culture data
   - With previous history of VRE and MRSA would consider use of
   daptomycin pending further culture data, as GNR more likely source
   would DC if blood cultures negative at 48 hrs. ID consult for
   antimicrobial guidance given complex history and multiple resistant
   organisms
   - Send additional Blood cultures
   - Follow up Urine culture
   - Send C. diff given recent broad spectrum Abx
   - Holding antihypertensives including metoprolol, lisinopril and
   spironolactone
   - Trend CE X3, appreciate cards input
   - Trend HCT, if reverse INR will need heparin gtt given mechanical AVR.
   - Send Type and Screen
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation
   - Holding antihypertensives as above given hypotension
   - Holding diuretics while volume repleting
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue statin
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - on coumadin, INR 7
   - Will need heparin gtt if INR reversed

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and subsequent explantation due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infection. The patient is currently presenting with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.

The patient's current conditions and medical complications include:
1. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) - likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other sources of infection.
2. Decubitus ulcer (pressure ulcer) present at admission.
3. Diabetes mellitus type I - requiring close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
4. Pain control - both acute and chronic pain management.
5. UTI - suspected source of infection with elevated white blood cell count (WBC) in the urine analysis. The patient has a history of recent broad-spectrum antibiotic courses, including a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection and a right foot infection.
6. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30% due to previous ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD placement.
7. Mechanical aortic valve replacement - on coumadin with an elevated INR of 7.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and subsequent removal due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infections. The patient has recently been treated for pseudomonal urinary tract infection (UTI) and right foot infection, now presenting with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with primary sources now being urine, recent foot ulcer, and known history of recurrent bloodstream infections. Empirical coverage for GNR with meropenem and empirical Dapto upfront given known history of VRE.
2. Cardiogenic shock due to low ejection fraction, but the patient appears warm and well perfused.
3. Anemia due to a single repeat HCT with significant drop from ED, so bleeding is a concern. Stat repeat labs will be done to evaluate for acute hemorrhage as an etiology for hypotension.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF) with creatinine 1.5, monitoring urine output (UOP), creatinine, and electrolytes. With the degree of hypotension, it may be pre-renal but could worsen.
5. Mechanical AVR on Coumadin, will switch to he"

   1.       Hypotension
 DDX is
          Sepsis with primary sources now being urine which is concerning,
   recent foot ulcer, and known hx of recurrent blood stream infections.
   At this point we will empirically cover GNR with Meropenem, and empiric
   Dapto upfront given known hx of VRE- follow up all blood and ruine.
   Send C diff. we will consider imaging foot.
           Cardiogenic: also a concern given known low EF but overall not
   cool- rather he is warm and seems well perfused         Anemia: we have
   a single repeat HCT with sig drop from ED- so bleeding a comcern, but
   will stat repeat labs as well in event he could have acute hemorrhage
   as etiology for hypotension.
   Will place CVL and check CVP and SCVo2
   2.       ARF: Cr 1.5, watch UOP and Cr and luytes with this degree of
   hypotension may be pre renal but likely to worsen.
   3.       Mech AVR- on coumadin, will switch to heparin as bridge when
   inr less than 3

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and subsequent removal due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bacteremia. The patient presents with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.

Assessment:
1. SIRS - WBC elevated to 19. Multiple potential sources of infection, including UTI, R foot ulcer s/p debridement, and BSI. No evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray and cough at patient's baseline. Also consider C. diff given multiple recent broad-spectrum courses of antimicrobials.
2. Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest and ICD explantation.
3. s/p Mechanical AVR - on coumadin, INR 7.
4. DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS.
5. Dyslipidemia - continue statin.
6. FEN - diabetic/cardiac diet, replete lytes PRN.
7. Access - PIV X1, will place CVL.
8. Prophylaxis - DVT: (Systemic anticoagulation: Coumadin), Stress ulcer: h2.

Plan:
- Continue IVF"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I, pain control (acute and chronic), decubitus ulcer, and urinary tract infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/52 to 145/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring BIPAP. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, ranitidine, amio, percocet, and klonopin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Cardiogenic Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and hypotension could be attributed to acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient will be treated with NIPPV (noninvasive positive pressure ventilation), Lasix (a diuretic), nitro (a vasodilator), and morphine for pain control. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored.
2. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests the possibility of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, likely secondary to a urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypotension. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various interventions. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type I, pain control, decubitus ulcer, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently experiencing acute cardiogenic edema, SIRS, sepsis (likely due to a urinary tract infection), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, and hemolysis across the valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Cardiogenic Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and hypotension may indicate acute cardiogenic edema. Immediate treatment with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), Lasix (a diuretic), nitro (a vasodilator), and morphine (for pain and anxiety) is necessary. Close monitoring of the patient's condition is advised.
2. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient's symptoms suggest SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) which may progress to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered while awaiting culture results. Maintaining the patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AVR): The patient's elevated heart rate and irregular rhythm suggest AVR. Bridging with intravenous heparin when appropriate is recommended.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest secondary to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with subsequent explanation in the setting of recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bacteremia, and recent broad-spectrum antibiotic courses for Pseudomonal urinary tract infection and right foot infection.

The patient presented with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. He required non-invasive ventilation multiple times due to flash pulmonary edema with acute drop in oxygen saturation, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, new crackles on exam, and new bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. The patient responded to nebulizers, nitroglycerin, lasix, morphine, and bipap. He remained normo-hypotensive for most of the day and was fluid positive by midnight on lasix drip.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 87/82 mmHg (hypotensive), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on bipap mask, and CVP of 19 mmHg. The patient is receiving various"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, and subsequent explanation due to recurrent high-grade coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bloodstream infections. The patient also has a history of pseudomonal urinary tract infection and right foot infection. He presents with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension.

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation multiple times due to flash pulmonary edema with acute drop in oxygen saturation, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, new crackles on examination, and new bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. He responded to nebulizers, nitroglycerin, lasix, morphine, and bipap. The patient's critical care plan includes managing hypertension, afterload reduction, cautious fluid management, and restarting home medications.

Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of multiple bloodstream infections involving the pacemaker/ICD and pseudomonal urinary tract infections. There is ongoing concern for infection, particularly with GNR (Gram-negative rod) bacteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and blood cultures are pending.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type I, pain control (acute and chronic), decubitus ulcer (present at admission), urinary tract infection (UTI), and coagulopathy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on BiPAP. The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation, diuretics (Lasix), and norepinephrine.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea and tachypnea. His physical examination shows coarse rales bilaterally with left-sided wheeze, and he is lying in bed with moderate respiratory distress. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is answering questions.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.6-15.3 thousand/mm³, decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 28.8-30.9%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 155-182 thousand/mm³, elevated troponin T levels of 0.04-0.07 ng/mL, and elevated total bilirubin (T Bili) of 0.8 mg/dL.

   Total time spent:
","The patient presents with respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation multiple times, most recently starting on August 19th at 5:00 AM. The patient's urine output has been falling, and diuretics like Lasix and Diuril have been given without response. The patient has allergies to no known drugs. The patient received antibiotics, specifically daptomycin on August 18th at 4:00 PM and meropenem on August 19th at 5:57 AM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with a range of 69-134 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/73 mmHg to 169/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 13-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is junctional.

The patient's weight is currently 112 kg and height is 74 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is at 11 mmHg with a range of 4-32 mmHg. Total intake is 1,043 mL since 12 AM, including 563 mL of fluids through IV and 450 mL of output through PO. Total output is 2,105 mL, consisting of 321 mL of urine output and 1,062 mL of negative balance. The patient is on bipap mask with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 912 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 282. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH at 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 40 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 22 mEq/L, base excess (BE) at -9 mEq/L, oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 96%, and lactate level at 1.9 mmol/L.

Physical examination reveals coarse rales bilaterally in the chest, rounding of the abdomen, and a left below-knee amputation. Neurological assessment shows the patient answering questions.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 10.4 to 14.6 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.7% to 30.9%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 155 to 182 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine (Cr) level at 1."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory distress and was started on non-invasive ventilation. They experienced episodes of acute respiratory distress and required multiple interventions, including the use of diuretics and vasopressor support. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical conditions, including acute cardiogenic edema, SIRS/sepsis, atrial fibrillation with a significantly elevated INR, acute kidney injury, hemolysis, and diabetes mellitus type 1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Cardiogenic Edema: The patient may be experiencing fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema and acute decompensated heart failure. Pressors and diuretic therapy may be necessary to manage this condition.
2. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient shows signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and possible sepsis, likely originating from a urinary tract infection. Source control and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated promptly.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a high risk of bleeding. Anticoagulation with heparin or other anticoagulants should be carefully managed while bridging to warfarin therapy.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by decreased urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is essential.
5. Hemolysis: There are indications of hemolysis across the heart valve"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including multiple vascular and cardiac surgeries, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), and low ejection fraction (EF). He was admitted with a pseudomonal urinary tract infection (UTI) and is now experiencing respiratory distress, requiring intermittent use of BiPAP. The patient's heart rate increased this morning, which could be compensation for decreased cardiac output after stopping Levophed, overdiuresis, or possible Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).

Assessment and Plan:

1. Volume status: The plan for yesterday was to diurese in the setting of flash pulmonary edema, hoping to improve respiratory status by optimizing cardiac function and reducing pulmonary edema. The patient diuresed well overnight and will continue to be diuresed. BiPAP will be continued for now, but cannot rely on it indefinitely. ABGs with clinical changes will be monitored, and mixed venous O2 values will be re-sent. Restarting pressors may be considered if necessary to provide inotropic support.

2. Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25-30% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD explantation/Mechanical Valve: The echo yesterday showed evidence of increased gradient across the valve, with a question of possible abnormal flow around the valve.

","The patient's progress note indicates several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection is suspected to be a urinary tract infection (UTI), for which antibiotics have been started empirically.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, as indicated by elevated central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and crackles on lung examination. This may be related to chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.0, but it has increased to 1.5 on admission and further to 1.6 since then. This could be due to multiple factors such as dehydration, hypotension, or the underlying chronic kidney disease.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I, there is no specific mention of DKA in the progress note. However, close monitoring of blood sugars is essential.

5. Dyslipidemia: The patient is already on a statin for managing dyslipidemia.

6. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, indicating the need for proper skin care and pressure relief measures.

7. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's EF of 25-30% suggests significant impairment of left ventricular function. The patient also has a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) explanation.

8. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, including prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR).

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, pain control (acute and chronic pain), decubitus ulcer (present at admission), pulmonary edema, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP and receiving medications such as famotidine, meropenem, and daptomycin. 

24-hour events include fever with a temperature of 101.5°F, difficulty with arterial line tracing, dressing changes, and replacement of the arterial line. The patient's respiratory distress continued despite being on BiPAP, and the Lasix drip was increased to promote diuresis. A transthoracic echo showed decreased ejection fraction and evidence of volume overload, as well as abnormal flow around a prosthetic valve. The patient's heart rate increased to the 120s, and an ABG showed a PO2 of 66. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and is receiving meropenem and daptomycin as antibiotics. Vital signs include a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure ranging from 134/62 mmHg to 149/130 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 11 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation between 66% and 98%, and fluid balance with an input of 1,572 mL and output of 2,309 mL. 

The patient's weight is currently 112.8 kg, and height is 74 inches. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and skin examination is also not performed. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.3 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 9.4 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 57 mg/dL, and increased creatinine at 1.5 mg/dL. Electrolytes show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.7 mEq/L, and hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 8.1 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical and family history is unchanged, and there are no known drug allergies. The patient's current medications include famotidine, meropenem, and daptomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient continues to experience episodes of respiratory distress despite being on BiPAP, indicating potential complications related to respiratory function.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection, which may be contributing to the respiratory distress and overall condition.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The decreased ejection fraction and evidence of volume overload on the transthoracic echo indicate potential cardiac dysfunction, which could be exacerbated by the patient's underlying conditions.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the recent arterial line changes.
5. Decubitus ulcer: The pre-existing decubitus ulcer may worsen due to immobility and poor tissue perfusion.
6. Fluid imbalance: The significant fluid input and output imbalance raises concerns about fluid overload and potential complications related to fluid management.
7. Medication errors: The concentrated Lasix drip given to the patient resulted in receiving five times the intended dose, increasing the risk of medication errors and associated complications.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of the patient."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. These include:

1. Decompensated heart failure: The patient is tenuous and dependent on BIPAP for breathing, and requires pressors to maintain blood pressure. An echocardiogram shows overload with a lower ejection fraction and worsened mitral regurgitation. Diuretics are being pushed as needed.

2. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): The patient has a fever and other signs of infection.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a known UTI but is already on antibiotics. However, they are now coughing, and sputum should be checked.

4. Valve issue: The patient's INR is falling, and they need to be bridged with heparin for valve purposes.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is stable, but they need to be monitored after Lasix administration.

6. Pain control: The patient has both acute and chronic pain that needs to be managed.

7. Decubitus ulcer: The patient had a pressure ulcer present at admission.

8. Diabetes mellitus type I: The patient has diabetes, which needs to be managed.

9. Possible complications from an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or other cardiac interventions.

10. Potential complications related to mechanical ventilation and weaning from the ventilator.

It is important to address these"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They presented with respiratory distress, hypotension, and heart failure. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, pain control, decubitus ulcer, coagulopathy, and a urinary tract infection.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is low at 110/60 mmHg, and heart rate is elevated in the range of 115-120 beats per minute. The patient is experiencing mechanical ventilation support through a BiPAP mask, with oxygen delivery set at 40%. Other respiratory parameters show a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a tidal volume (VT) of 772 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, high creatinine levels, elevated potassium levels, low magnesium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The cardiac troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, and blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Physical examination reveals coarse rales and left-sided wheezing in the chest, with the patient appearing modulate and experiencing respiratory distress when removed from the BiPAP mask. Neurological examination shows that the patient is answering questions appropriately.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Chief Complaint: The patient presents with respiratory distress, hypotension, and heart failure.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.5°F.
3. Transthoracic Echo: The echo reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%, indicating severe heart dysfunction. There is also worsening mitral regurgitation (MR) and abnormal diastolic flow in the ascending aorta involving the anterior portion of the ascending aorta graft. Additionally, the left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality with elevated left atrial pressure.
4. Lasix Drip: The patient was receiving a Lasix drip, but it was held due to the concentration being reduced from 100 mg per bag to 500 mg per bag. This adjustment may have impacted the patient's fluid balance and renal function.
5. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: The patient's blood pressure is stable at 110/60 mmHg, but their heart rate is elevated in the range of 115-120 bpm. Levophed was held, which could be contributing to the drop in blood pressure.
6. Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.
7. Antibiotics: The patient received daptomycin and meropenem, which are broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with chief complaints of respiratory distress, hypotension, and heart failure. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I, pain control (acute and chronic), decubitus ulcer, pulmonary edema, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently experiencing decompensated heart failure, as indicated by being tenuous and dependent on BIPAP, as well as requiring pressors. The echocardiogram shows a lower ejection fraction and worse mitral regurgitation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including daptomycin and meropenem for infections, lasix for fluid management, and other ICU medications. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.50, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 165, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%.

   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF requiring intermittent
   BiPAP, levophed and diureses
   .
   # systolic CHF - Prior echo EF 25-30% . Repeat echo estimated EF at
   20%. Cardiology consulted and recommend levophed and diuresis until
   creatinine bumps and then resume home lasix. Think this is likely
   mostly distributive, with some component of cardiogenic hypotension.
   They do not recommend ionotrope at this point. Also, they think echo is
   related to demand changes and fluid overload. This is likely
   contributing to pulmonary edema resulting in hypoxic respiratory
   distress. Diuresis has improved his respiratory status to date. Still
   up 1L of fluid for the day. Had acute episode of hypoxemia which
   responded to BiPAP. No TEE at this point.
   -Continue to diurese (furosemide, chlorothiazide) today until Cr bumps
   further, then restart home lasix dose
   -If tolerates consider PO metolazone to boost diuresis
   -Continue norepinephrine as needed to keep MAPs > 60 and UOP at

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including multiple vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). He was admitted with respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF and required intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and norepinephrine (levophed) for hypotension. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. He is on aggressive diuresis and his urine output goal is >100 mL/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20% on repeat echo. Cardiology recommends continuing levophed and diuresis until creatinine levels increase, then resume home lasix. The patient's pulmonary edema is contributing to hypoxic respiratory distress.
2. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient experiences episodes of hypoxemia, which respond to BiPAP. His respiratory status is improving with diuresis.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support for hypotension, with cardiogenic vs distributive causes being considered. Decreased EF and fever are present, and the patient has an increasing white blood cell count, suggesting a possible UTI as the infectious source.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.6 mg/dL, indicating ARF. Aggressive diuresis will be continued until creatinine levels increase, and then the diuretic dose will be adjusted accordingly.
5. UTI: The patient has a WBC trend upward and fever, suggesting a UTI infection. ID (infectious disease) recommendations should be followed.
6. Mechanical ventilation: The patient's INR goal range is 2.5-3.5, and it is currently at goal. Heparin drip has been discontinued, and Coumadin will be continued with a decreased dose of 3 mg/day.
7. Dyslipidemia: The patient has dyslipidemia and should continue on a statin.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF requiring intermittent
   BiPAP, levophed and diureses
   .
   # systolic CHF - Prior echo EF 25-30% . Repeat echo estimated EF at
   20%. Cardiology consulted and recommend levophed and diuresis until
   creatinine bumps and then resume home lasix. Think this is likely
   mostly distributive, with some component of cardiogenic hypotension.
   They do not recommend ionotrope at this point. Also, they think echo is
   related to demand changes and fluid overload. This is likely
   contributing to pulmonary edema resulting in hypoxic respiratory
   distress. Diuresis has improved his respiratory status to date. Still
   up 1L of fluid for the day. Had acute episode of hypoxemia which
   responded to BiPAP. No TEE at this point.
   -Continue to diurese (furosemide, chlorothiazide) today until Cr bumps
   further, then restart home lasix dose
   -If tolerates consider PO metolazone to boost diuresis
   -Continue norepinephrine as needed to keep MAPs > 60 and UOP at
   100ml/hr, wean as tolerated
   -BiPAP as needed, ABGs as needed for respiratory distress
   -Appreciate cardiology recs

   # Hypoxic respiratory distress - accompanied by increased work of
   breathing. Likely secondary to overall volume status. Treat systolic
   CHF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including multiple vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a pseudomonal urinary tract infection (UTI). He presented with respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF and required intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support and vasopressor therapy with levophed. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, and various interventions have been implemented to manage his multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF, which is worsening due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Diuretics have been prescribed to manage this condition, and further adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine levels.
2. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient experienced an acute episode of hypoxemia that responded well to BiPAP. This suggests the presence of underlying respiratory compromise, possibly exacerbated by overall volume status. Treatment for systolic CHF should help alleviate respiratory distress.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urine output (UOP). The exact cause of hypotension is uncertain, with potential contributors including cardiogenic and distributive factors. Continued monitoring and adjustment of vasopressor therapy will be necessary.
4. UTI: The patient has an ongoing pseudomonal UTI, as"

   1.       Hypotension in setting Decompensated heart failure and likely
   some distributive component with persistent fevers: tenuous and on/off
   BIPAP -on/off pressors. I was encouraged yesterday when he came off
   BIPAP for many hours and appeared to be turning a corner.  However this
   AM he looks like he may go back on.         Echo clearly overloaded
   with lower EF and worse MR- we are pushing diuresis with pressors as
   needed.
                         Cards consultation is in agrrement with plan and
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4646**] who knows him well feels that pushing diuresis is
   best option at this point. We continue to search for underlying cause
   for infection.
   2. Respiratpry Distress: Seems like pulm edema is accounting for
   majority of this process though it is hard to rule out CAP
 we had
   covered with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9562**] [**Last Name (un) **] and paired to [**Last Name (un) **] since only + was a UA. We
   will send sputum today as he is coughing a bit and consider added back
   MRSA coverage if he remains BIPAP dependent- though this is empiric.
   Clearly he cannot remiaing on BIPAP for most of the day for much
   longer- yet a decision to intubate is not without risk and we would
   need to discuss  with he and his wife.
   3. Fevers: UTI known but has been on ABX- new coughing, check sputum,
   repeat CXR  Continue [**Last Name (un) 430**] Pan Cx and follow up
 check C diff. Occult
   abscess is an issue given hx of bacteremia but nothing thus far in
   blood cx.
   5.       ARF: tough balance as he needs diuresis to improve forward
   flow. Cr up to 1.6 today and bears very close watching.
   6.       Valve- inr , needs bridge with heparin for valve

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and respiratory failure. He has a history of decompensated heart failure, pulmonary edema, type I diabetes mellitus, pain control (acute and chronic pain), SIRS, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with coagulopathy and his labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin levels. The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decompensated heart failure: The patient's low ejection fraction and worsening mitral regurgitation indicate a high risk for further deterioration in cardiac function. This can lead to increased fluid accumulation, worsening pulmonary edema, and hypotension.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to pulmonary edema or possibly community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is a need for ongoing respiratory support, and the possibility of intubation and mechanical ventilation should be considered.
3. UTI: The patient has a known UTI, which needs to be appropriately treated with antibiotics. However, the new coughing and fever suggest a possible superimposed infection, such as pneumonia, which needs to be ruled out.
4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-inch tall, 112.8 kg male admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, pain control (acute and chronic), decubitus ulcer (present at admission), coagulopathy, and SIRS. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/58 to 131/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and the use of non-invasive ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.

2. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and presence of SIRS suggest an underlying infection. The patient also has a history of UTI and may be at risk for other infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or bloodstream infections.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and the need for vasopressor support indicate possible cardiovascular instability. This could be due to cardiogenic shock or septic shock secondary to an underlying infection.

4. Diabetic Complications: The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, which puts him at risk for"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated on non-invasive ventilation and has been started on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. 

The patient's medical history includes decompensated heart failure, diabetes mellitus type I, pain control (acute and chronic), SIRS, and urinary tract infection. 

On physical examination, the patient is lying in bed, off BIPAP with moderate respiratory distress. There are coarse rales bilaterally in the chest, abdominal guarding, and rounding, as well as left below-knee amputation which is warm. Neurologically, the patient is answering questions but in respiratory distress.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal hemoglobin and creatinine levels, and elevated glucose levels. Electrolytes are within normal range. Blood cultures were taken on multiple occasions. 

Imaging shows cardiomegaly with slight cutoff of diaphragms on chest X-ray. 

The patient's current plan includes treatment for coagulopathy, pulmonary edema, diabetes mellitus type I, pain control, SIRS, and urinary tract infection. 

The patient's decompensated heart failure is managed with diuretics and hemodynamic support as needed. The patient's fever is attributed to a urinary tract infection, which is already being treated with antibiotics. The patient's valve requires bridge therapy with"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type 1, chronic kidney disease, and a history of left below-knee amputation. He presents with hypotension and respiratory failure, requiring non-invasive ventilation and vasopressor support. The patient's condition is complicated by decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and moderate mitral regurgitation, leading to pulmonary edema. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a normal pH, elevated PaCO2, and normal PaO2/FiO2 ratio.

On physical examination, the patient appears to be in moderate respiratory distress and has coarse rales bilaterally in his chest. His neurologic examination is notable for answering questions but being in respiratory distress. 

The patient's medical history includes a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which he has been receiving antibiotics. He also has a history of pain, both acute and chronic, and requires pain control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Overall, the patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of his heart failure"

   # systolic CHF - Prior echo EF 25-30% . Repeat echo estimated EF at
   20%. Cardiology consulted and recommend levophed and diuresis until
   creatinine bumps and then resume home lasix. Think this is likely
   mostly distributive, with some component of cardiogenic hypotension.
   They do not recommend ionotrope at this point. Also, they think echo is
   related to demand changes and fluid overload. This is likely
   contributing to pulmonary edema resulting in hypoxic respiratory
   distress. Diuresis has improved his respiratory status to date. Still
   up 1L of fluid for the day. Had acute episode of hypoxemia which
   responded to BiPAP. No TEE at this point.
   -Continue to diurese (furosemide, chlorothiazide) today until Cr bumps
   further, then restart home lasix dose

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type I. He was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient requires intermittent non-invasive ventilation (NIV), norepinephrine infusion for hypotension, and diuretics. He has a history of systolic CHF with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%, which has now decreased to 20%. The patient also has a decubitus ulcer present at admission, pain control issues, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and a previous episode of hypoxemia that responded to NIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic CHF: The patient's history of CHF and decreased EF indicates a risk for worsening systolic CHF. Monitoring fluid balance, administering diuretics, and considering inotropic support may be necessary.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be secondary to pulmonary edema resulting from fluid overload. Continuing diuretic therapy and NIV as needed is recommended.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support with norepinephrine due to hypotension, which could be either cardiogenic or distributive in origin. Close monitoring of blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress likely secondary to CHF requiring intermittent
   BiPAP, levophed and diureses
   .
   # systolic CHF - Prior echo EF 25-30% . Repeat echo estimated EF at
   20%. Cardiology consulted and recommend levophed and diuresis until
   creatinine bumps and then resume home lasix. Think this is likely
   mostly distributive, with some component of cardiogenic hypotension.
   They do not recommend ionotrope at this point. Also, they think echo is
   related to demand changes and fluid overload. This is likely
   contributing to pulmonary edema resulting in hypoxic respiratory
   distress. Diuresis has improved his respiratory status to date. Still
   up 1L of fluid for the day. Had acute episode of hypoxemia which
   responded to BiPAP. No TEE at this point.
   -Continue to diurese (furosemide, chlorothiazide) today until Cr bumps
   further, then restart home lasix dose
   -If tolerates consider PO metolazone to boost diuresis
   -Continue norepinephrine as needed to keep MAPs > 60 and UOP at
   100ml/hr, wean as tolerated
   -BiPAP as needed, ABGs as needed for respiratory distress
   -Appreciate cardiology recs
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress - accompanied by increased work of
   breathing. Likely secondary to overall volume status. Treat systolic
   CHF.
   -Per above
   .
   # Hypotension - requiring pressor support. Cardiogenic vs distributive.
   Decreased EF. Febrile. WBC increasing. Dapto was d/c'ed. UTI only
   infectious source at this time.
   -Per above
   -Continue meropenem (day [**3-7**]) as treatment for UTI
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
   -Trend WBC, clinical status
   -Pan-culture if spikes, tylenol
   -Stool for c.diff.
   -TSH, random cortisol
   .
   # UTI - WBC trending up. Febrile again. UTI infection. ID following
   -Per above
   -Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Mechanical MV - INR goal range 2.5 - 3.5. Currently at goal. INR
   remained elevated throughout stay. D/C'ed heparin drip
   -Continue coumadin, decreased dose today to 3
   -Follow daily INR
   .
   # ARF - Cr 1.5 on admission. To 1.6 today. Aggressive diuresis. Will
   slow diuresis once Cr increases.
   -PM lytes, BUN/Cr
   -UOP goal > 100

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, ventricular fibrillation arrest post-aortic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), and recurrent high-grade coagulase-negative Staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bloodstream infections. The patient is currently presenting with suprapubic pain and fever. He has been on non-invasive ventilation and blood cultures have been obtained. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/60 mmHg to 162/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is first-degree atrioventricular block (AV block). Fluid balance shows an input of 1,266 mL and output of 2,650 mL. The patient is receiving diuretics and has been started on levophed due to hypotension. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine levels. Imaging reveals improvement in lung fields, bilateral atelectasis, and scattered opacifications without any new pulmonary infiltrates. The patient is being treated for a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type I. He was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory distress. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP, despite diuresis. Initially, the etiology was thought to be cardiogenic from decompensated heart failure, but there is a possibility of an infectious component as well.
2. Intermittent Fevers: The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, which were initially covered with meropenem for a known UTI. However, with recent fevers, there is concern for worsening or new infection, possibly a pulmonary source or an occult intraabdominal process.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, which has now worsened in acute decompensation. Cardiology is following and recommending diuresis.
4. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support again after intubation, with low pressures possibly due to poor cardiac function or early sepsis.
5. UTI: The patient has a known pseudomonas UTI, and the ID team is following up.
6. Mechanical Ventilation: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic despite"

1. The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type I diabetes mellitus (DM).

2. The patient was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory distress. Initially, it was thought that the respiratory failure was secondary to CHF, but there are now concerns for an infectious component as well.

3. The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers with increased cough, and a CT scan showed ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring intermittent BiPAP and eventually intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.

5. The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus type I, and dyslipidemia.

6. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 142/62 mmHg to 146/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with severe systolic heart failure and respiratory failure. He was intubated yesterday and has been on low-dose levophed. Aggressive diuresis is being attempted. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, chronic pain, acute pain, decubitus ulcer, pulmonary edema, and diabetes mellitus type II.

24-hour events include non-invasive ventilation stopped and invasive ventilation started, sputum culture taken, and administration of antibiotics (daptomycin, meropenem, and vancomycin).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.7°C, heart rate 77 bpm, blood pressure 116/53 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient has a first-degree AV block and bilateral crackles in the chest. He is alert and attentive but unable to stand or assess neurologic function.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are high, and there are abnormalities in electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), liver function tests (ALT, AST), kidney function tests (creatinine), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, INR). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - requiring intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but less likely that he has a pneumonia contributing to
   his hypoxia in light of his improved CXR with diuresis.
   -Gases stable, on PS [**8-1**], with subjective improvement; will attempt to
   wean down to 5/5 and potentially try PEEP of zero later in the day
   -continue Lasix drip, with goal of 1L negative; will closely monitor
   UOP throughout the day
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Covered with meropenem for known UTI, day [**7-7**].
   Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with recent fevers there
   is concern for worsening or new infection, but still without clear
   source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source.  No
   evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the wound does
   not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**]. Cdiff negative.
   -continue to follow up culture data
   - wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.
   -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.
   -continue diuresis, monitor hemodynamics.  Lasix. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1L today.
   -has been off Levophed support x 24 hours. Will continue to monitor for
   need for pressors
   .
   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation.
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
   -Trend WBC, clinical status.
   -Pan-culture if spikes, tylenol.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type I diabetes mellitus (DM).
- The patient was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory distress. He required intermittent BiPAP support due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition worsened, leading to endotracheal intubation on [**8-22**].
- The initial diagnosis was cardiogenic hypoxia secondary to decompensated heart failure. However, a CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggesting infection, edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has intermittent fevers, covered with meropenem for known UTI. Daptomycin and vancomycin were discontinued.
- The patient has systolic CHF, previously known failure, now worsened in acute decompensation.
- The patient requires pressor support again after intubation.
- The patient has a UTI, currently being treated with meropenem.
- The patient's INR is elevated and goal range is 2.5-3.5. Coumadin was given, but the INR continues to rise, so Vitamin K is administered. No signs"

   Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP, despite
   diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.  However, he has been spiking fevers with
   increased cough, and an infectious component is also possible.
   -Gases stable, on PS [**10-1**], with subjective improvement
   -CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass opacity with consolidation,
   suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   -continue Lasix drip, change Diuril to PO.
   -CT findings thought more likely to represent edema.  Vancomycin d/c'ed
   today.
   .
   Intermittent Fevers:  Covered with meropenem for known UTI, day 6.
   Daptomycin discontinued per ID recs.  Now with recent fevers there is
   concern for worsening or new infection.  CT showed no evidence for
   abdominal/pelvic source.  Vanco started yesterday, as above, now
   discontinued.
   -C. diff negative.
   - CT showed no evidence of abdominal source.
   -vascular consulted to assess right foot ulcer, s/p debridement by
   vascular service on [**2178-6-29**], still with wound vac.  X-ray obtained with
   no evidence for osteo

   - wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.

   # systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.
   -continue diuresis, monitor hemodynamics.  Lasix and metolazone.
   -currently on Levophed for BP support, UOP.

   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation.
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
   -Trend WBC, clinical status.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type I diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypoxia and requires mechanical ventilation (MV). He is also on a diuretic drip, and his condition has been complicated by several factors, including respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, and a history of pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This may be secondary to cardiogenic causes from decompensated heart failure or an infectious component.

2. UTI: The patient has been treated with meropenem for a known UTI, but recent fevers raise concerns for worsening or new infections. C. difficile has been ruled out.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a history of a foot ulcer that required debridement and is currently being monitored for wound care.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a bleeding risk. Coumadin has been held, and Vitamin K has been administered to lower the INR. DIC labs have been drawn to assess for disseminated intrav"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted to the ICU for volume resuscitation following urosepsis. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in his chest X-ray, with significant reduction in bilateral infiltrates. His respiratory settings have been adjusted to pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 5 cmH2O, with plans to further decrease PEEP and aim for a negative fluid balance of 1L.

The patient is also being treated for pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) with meropenem, and his fevers have persisted despite antibiotic therapy. His CHF symptoms are being managed with diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy has been temporarily held.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding, and his glycemic control is being monitored. He has multiple IV lines in place, including an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring and a multi-lumen line for medication administration. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are also being implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - required intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but less likely that he has a pneumonia contributing to
   his hypoxia in light of his improved CXR with diuresis.
   -Gases stable, weaned down to PEEP of zero successfully this AM,
   potentially will extubate today.
   -continue Lasix drip with goal 1L negative at end of the day. Will give
   diuril one hour prior to extubation to prevent flash.  Follow I/O
   closely today, adjust drip as needed and give diuril as needed.
   -hold sedation, plan for extubation later today if remaining stable.
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Covered with meropenem for known UTI, day [**8-7**].
   Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with recent fevers there
   is concern for worsening or new infection, but still without clear
   source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source.  No
   evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the wound does
   not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**]. Cdiff negative.
   Still spiking fevers to 101 on [**Last Name (un) 430**] x 7d, had been on dapto for h/o
   coag neg staph earlier in admission but this was d/ced on [**8-19**]. esr
   found to be 122. also concerned for graft or av valve infection.
   -continue to follow up culture data
   - wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.  Vascular debrided wound again this morning, not concerned
   for wound infection.
   -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site.
   -check in with ID, concern for graft infection, possible need for
   long-term antibiotics
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.
   -continue diuresis as above, monitor hemodynamics. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1L today.
   -Pressors d/c'ed 2 days ago

He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current conditions include fever of unknown origin (FUO), acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, acute respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome/ARDS), alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, pulmonary edema, decubitus ulcer (present at admission), diabetes mellitus type I, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's past medical history includes vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, CHF, and type I diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with a pseudomonas UTI and respiratory distress, likely secondary to CHF. He required intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support despite diuresis and was eventually intubated on [**8-22**] for hypoxic respiratory failure.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - requiring intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but less likely that he has a pneumonia contributing to
   his hypoxia in light of his improved CXR with diuresis.
   -Gases stable, weaned down to PS 5/5, will potentially try PEEP of zero
   today
   -continue Lasix drip at 20, with goal of 200cc/hour. Administer diuril
   as needed to achieve goal of 1L negative; will closely monitor UOP
   throughout the day
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Covered with meropenem for known UTI, day [**8-7**].
   Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with recent fevers there
   is concern for worsening or new infection, but still without clear
   source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source.  No
   evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the wound does
   not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**]. Cdiff negative.
   Still spiking fevers to 101 on [**Last Name (un) **] x 7d, had been on dapto for h/o
   coag neg staph earlier in admission but this was d/ced on [**8-19**]. esr
   found to be 122. also concerned for graft or av valve infection. could
   also consider getting TEE (if we want to do this it should be before
   extubation).
   -continue to follow up culture data
   - wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.
   -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.
   -continue diuresis as above, monitor hemodynamics. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1L today.
   -Pressors d/c'ed 2 days ago
   .
   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation.
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
   -Trend WBC, clinical status.
   -Pan-culture if spikes, tylenol.
   # UTI -  treating with meropenem
   -Per above
   -Appreciate ID recs
   # Mechanical MV - INR goal range 2.5 - 3.5. Coumadin given 3 days ago.
   INR subtherapeutic today today s/p 2mg Vitamin K yesterday. 2mg
   Coumadin administered last PM.
   -Will increase dose of coumadin to 5mg tonight.
   -trend INR
   -PTT also noted to be elevated, DIC labs drawn
 fibrinogen and FDP
   both elevated; LFT's stable.
   # ARF - Cr elevated but stable.  Will continue to follow closely with
   multiple possible causes for renal failure
 diuresis, poor perfusion,
   hypotension, UTI. Will continue lasix unless Cr bumps.
   # DM type 2 -
   -Mostly appropriate levels. Continue to monitor.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory distress, and subsequently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers despite being on antibiotics. The source of the fever is still unknown.

2. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient has a known history of CHF, which has now worsened in acute decompensation.

3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient initially required BiPAP but was subsequently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. There is evidence of infection or edema on the chest X-ray, but it is less likely to be pneumonia contributing to his hypoxia.

4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric (NG) tube.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a decubitus ulcer present at admission.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a coagulation disorder. DIC labs have been drawn to assess for disse"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - requiring intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but less likely that he has a pneumonia contributing to
   his hypoxia in light of his improved CXR with diuresis.
   -Gases stable, weaned down to PS 5/5, will potentially try PEEP of zero
   today
   -continue Lasix drip at 20, with goal of 200cc/hour. Administer diuril
   as needed to achieve goal of 1L negative; will closely monitor UOP
   throughout the day
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Covered with meropenem for known UTI, day [**8-7**].
   Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with recent fevers there
   is concern for worsening or new infection, but still without clear
   source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source.  No
   evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the wound does
   not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**]. Cdiff negative.
   Still spiking fevers to 101 on [**Last Name (un) **] x 7d, had been on dapto for h/o
   coag neg staph earlier in admission but this was d/ced on [**8-19**]. esr
   found to be 122. also concerned for graft or av valve infection. could
   also consider getting TEE (if we want to do this it should be before
   extubation).
   -continue to follow up culture data
   - wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.
   -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.
   -continue diuresis as above, monitor hemodynamics. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1L today.
   -Pressors d/c'ed 2 days ago
   .
   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation.
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
   -Trend WBC, clinical status.
   -Pan-culture if spikes, tylenol.
   # UTI -  treating with meropenem
   -Per above

   -Will increase dose of coumadin to 5mg tonight.
   -trend INR
   -PTT also noted to be elevated, DIC labs drawn
 fibrinogen and FDP
   both elevated; LFT's stable.
   # ARF - Cr elevated but stable.  Will continue to follow closely with

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type I diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory distress, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated since August 22nd for hypoxic respiratory failure and has intermittent fevers.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, lasix, acetozolamide, diuril, ranitidine, vancomycin, meropenem, and midazolam. He has been on a lasix drip at 20 mg/hour with a goal of 200cc/hour and is receiving diuril as needed to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. His urine output will be closely monitored throughout the day.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). His blood cultures are pending, as well as tests for Legionella urinary antigen, urine culture, and stool Clostridium difficile toxin A & B.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a CT torso on August 22nd showing ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His chest X-ray has improved with diuresis and does not show evidence of pneumonia."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for urosepsis and underwent volume resuscitation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently showing improvement, with his respiratory status described as hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. The goal is to extubate him today after he wakes up more.

The patient has been febrile, and antibiotics have been initiated for a suspected pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). A foot wound was debrided today, and the patient's ESR is elevated, but there are no findings consistent with osteomyelitis.

The patient's CHF is being managed with a goal of 1 liter negative fluid balance for the day. Anticoagulation has been restarted with Coumadin, and lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line, have been placed.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Overall, the patient remains critically ill."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and CHF. He has been receiving treatment for a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and underwent debridement of a foot wound. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, fevers, and CHF. His vital signs are stable, but he is still mechanically ventilated and receiving medications such as fentanyl, lasix, and diuretics. The patient's lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not respond to the current treatment and weaning from mechanical ventilation is not successful.
2. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's CHF may further deteriorate due to fluid overload or inadequate diuresis, leading to worsening pulmonary edema and hypoxemia.
3. Infection: Although the patient is on antibiotics, there is a risk of ongoing or new infections, particularly since he is immunocompromised due to critical illness.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's first-degree AV block could progress to more serious arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential"

   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,

   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - required intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but unclear if pneumonia is contributing factor as CXR
   looks somewhat improved with diuresis (may be difficult to tell because
   also received 750cc bolus immediately prior to CXR)
   -s/p extubation yesterday with stable gases
   -Lasix drip currently held as negative >2L. Goal is to stay between
   500cc-negative for entire day. Will add back diuril or lasix as needed.
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Afebrile overnight. Covered with meropenem for
   known UTI, day [**9-7**].  Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with
   recent fevers there is concern for worsening or new infection, but
   still without clear source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic
   source.  No evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the
   wound does not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with
   additional debridement on [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative. Still spiking fevers
   to 101 on [**Last Name (un) 430**] x 7d, had been on dapto for h/o coag neg staph earlier
   in admission but this was d/ced on [**8-19**]. esr found to be 122. also
   concerned for graft or av valve infection, in addition to pneumonia not
   on CXR or ?line infection. ID consulted, and recommended no additional
   antibiotics.
   -continue to follow up culture data
   -wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.
    -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site. Might consider
   pulling line.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.  s/p overdiuresis last night and required 750mL bolus.
    -holding diuresis as above, monitor hemodynamics. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1-2L today.
    -Pressors d/c'ed 3 days ago
   .
   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation. With
   low MAPs last night, responded to boluses. Likely [**1-26**] overdiuresis.

    -check PM [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue coumadin 2mg daily and heparin bridge
   -trend INR
   .
   # ARF - Cr down today to 1.2 (baseline 1.4-1.6). Possibly  improved now

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory distress. The patient required intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support and was intubated on 8/22 due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The initial etiology of the respiratory failure was thought to be cardiogenic from decompensated heart failure, but further investigation revealed ground glass opacity with consolidation on a computed tomography (CT) scan, suggesting infection, edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, despite being treated with antibiotics for a known UTI. There is concern for worsening or new infection, but no clear source has been identified. A CT scan showed no evidence of abdominal or pelvic source, and the vascular team does not believe the right foot wound appears acutely infected. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin test was negative. The patient has had two debridements of the wound, most recently on 8/25. He is currently afebrile.

The patient's heart failure has worsened, and he is now experiencing systolic CHF, likely secondary to acute decompensation. He received an excessive amount of diuretics last night, resulting in overdi"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,
   mechanical valve replacement, CHF, admitted with pseudomonas UTI,
   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - required intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but unclear if pneumonia is contributing factor as CXR
   looks somewhat improved with diuresis (may be difficult to tell because
   also received 750cc bolus immediately prior to CXR)
   -s/p extubation yesterday with stable gases
   -Lasix drip currently held as negative >2L. Goal is to stay between
   1-2L negative for entire day. Will add back diuril or lasix as needed.
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Afebrile overnight. Covered with meropenem for
   known UTI, day [**9-7**].  Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with
   recent fevers there is concern for worsening or new infection, but
   still without clear source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic
   source.  No evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the
   wound does not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with
   additional debridement on [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative. Still spiking fevers
   to 101 on [**Last Name (un) 430**] x 7d, had been on dapto for h/o coag neg staph earlier
   in admission but this was d/ced on [**8-19**]. esr found to be 122. also
   concerned for graft or av valve infection, in addition to pneumonia not
   on CXR or ?line infection. ID consulted, and recommended no additional
   antibiotics.
   -continue to follow up culture data
   -wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.
    -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site. Might consider
   pulling line.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.  s/p overdiuresis last night and required 750mL bolus.
    -holding diuresis as above, monitor hemodynamics. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1-2L today.
    -Pressors d/c'ed 3 days ago
   .
   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation. With
   low MAPs last night, responded to boluses. Likely [**1-26**] overdiuresis.
   .
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
    -Trend WBC, clinical status.
    -Pan-culture if spikes, tylenol.
   .
   # UTI -  treating with meropenem
   .
    -Per above
   .
   # Mechanical aortic  valve - INR goal range 2.5 - 3.5. INR
   subtherapeutic for past two days. 2mg Coumadin administered for last
   two nights.  Also on heparin bridge in light of severe CHF.
    -check PM [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue coumadin 2mg daily and heparin bridge
   -trend INR
   .
   # ARF - Cr down today to 1.2 (baseline 1.4-1.6). Possibly  improved now
   that diuresis held. Will continue to follow closely with multiple
   possible causes for renal failure
 diuresis, poor perfusion,
   hypotension, UTI.
   .
   # DM type 2 -
    -Mostly appropriate levels. Continue to monitor.
    -ISS

 Now on ventilator with NG tube.   Tube feeds d/ced. Started on

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type I.
- The patient was admitted with a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory distress. Intermittent BiPAP was used initially but eventually required intubation due to persistent hypoxia.
- The etiology of the respiratory failure was initially thought to be cardiogenic from decompensated heart failure. However, a CT torso showed ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, despite being on meropenem for a known UTI. There is concern for worsening or new infection, but no clear source has been identified. A CT scan showed no evidence of abdominal/pelvic source, and the vascular surgeon indicated that the wound does not appear acutely infected.
- The patient has a history of coagulation-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, which was treated with daptomycin and subsequently discontinued.
- The patient's systolic CHF has worsened due to acute decompensation. Overdiuresis occurred last night, resulting in the need for a 750mL bolus. Diuretic therapy has been held.
- The patient also experienced hypotension requiring pressor support again after"

   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2178-8-25**] 02:25 PM
   -seen by vascular in am, R foot wound debrided with wound vac change -
   they say that the wound does not look infected, not a likely source for
   fevers.
   -sedated during rounds, but respiratory status improved, with minimal
   support.  Planned for extubation later in the day if more alert.
   -Extubated early afternoon, post-extubation gas stable - 7.45/54/82
   -Discussed with ID, recommend not starting any new antibiotics.  Could
   consider medications effects, changing line, repeat chest CT.
   -6 pm labs - PTT therapeutic, INR 2.0, Chem 7 showed low K, repleted
   per sliding scale.
   -significant diuresis in afternoon/evening.  Stopped lasix drip, given
   500 cc bolus.
   -overnight mild hypotension, MAP's in mid fifties.  Had overshot
   diuresis goal for the day, so another 250 ml bolus was given.

   67M with complicated PMHx including vascular and cardiac surgeries,

   respiratory distress.  Likely secondary to CHF - required intermittent
   BiPAP despite diuresis, now intubated ([**8-22**]) for hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
 persistent hypoxia when taken off BiPAP,
   despite diuresis.  Etiology initially thought to be cardiogenic from
   decompensated heart failure.   CT torso on [**8-22**] showed ground glass
   opacity with consolidation, suggestive of infection, edema, or ARDS.
   With fevers, but unclear if pneumonia is contributing factor as CXR
   looks somewhat improved with diuresis (may be difficult to tell because
   also received 750cc bolus immediately prior to CXR)
   -s/p extubation yesterday with stable gases
   -Lasix drip currently held as negative >2L. Goal is to stay between
   1-2L negative for entire day. Will add back diuril or lasix as needed.
   -Might consider CT chest if strong suspicion for pneumonia (i.e. CXR
   continues to show no improvement despite negative fluid balance)
   .
   #Intermittent Fevers:  Afebrile overnight. Covered with meropenem for
   known UTI, day [**9-7**].  Daptomycin and vancomycin discontinued.  Now with
   recent fevers there is concern for worsening or new infection, but
   still without clear source.  CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic
   source.  No evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the
   wound does not look acutely infected. s/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with
   additional debridement on [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative. Still spiking fevers
   to 101 on [**Last Name (un) 430**] x 7d, had been on dapto for h/o coag neg staph earlier
   in admission but this was d/ced on [**8-19**]. esr found to be 122. also
   concerned for graft or av valve infection, in addition to pneumonia not
   on CXR or ?line infection. ID consulted, and recommended no additional
   antibiotics.
   -continue to follow up culture data
   -wound care for continued Q3 day wound vac changes and wound
   monitoring.
    -Has IJ in, but line does not look infected. Could not get PICC in
   light of fevers. Will continue to monitor line site. Might consider
   pulling line.
   .
   # Systolic CHF
 previously known failure, now worsened in acute
   decompensation.  s/p overdiuresis last night and required 750mL bolus.
    -holding diuresis as above, monitor hemodynamics. Check [**Hospital1 **] lytes;
   expect -1-2L today.
    -Pressors d/c'ed 3 days ago
   .
   # Hypotension
 requiring pressor support again after intubation. With
   low MAPs last night, responded to boluses. Likely [**1-26**] overdiuresis.
   -F/u culture data - add abx as appropriate
    -Trend WBC, clinical status.
    -Pan-culture if spikes, tylenol.
   # UTI -  treating with meropenem

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of vascular and cardiac surgeries, mechanical valve replacement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and type I diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory distress, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient required intermittent BiPAP and was subsequently intubated. A CT torso showed ground glass opacity with consolidation, suggesting infection, edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers, and there is a concern for worsening or new infection. However, no clear source has been identified. The patient also has systolic CHF, hypotension, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, coagulopathy, pain control, and suspected urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's intermittent fevers and the presence of consolidation on the CT torso suggest a possible infection. Further investigations are needed to determine the specific source and appropriate treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and the CT findings raise the possibility of pneumonia. Monitoring the patient's oxygenation status and considering a repeat chest CT if there is no improvement in the chest X-ray.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF, and the recent acute decompensation may indicate worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuretic therapy is essential.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted to the ICU for volume resuscitation due to urosepsis. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/46 to 134/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 2,381 mL since midnight, indicating that more fluid has been output than input. The patient's CVP is within normal range at 4 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 1,999 mL of fluids since midnight, including 1,752 mL of IV fluids and 593 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output has been good at 4,380 mL since midnight.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 190, which suggests adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The patient is currently on room air with a nasal cannula.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for volume resuscitation due to urosepsis. He has been extubated and is doing well on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. His chest X-ray has improved. He is being treated with meropenem for a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), and his fever curve is improving. The patient's CHF is being managed with diuretics to achieve euvolemic status. Anticoagulation therapy is being continued with both Coumadin and heparin until the international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than 2.5. Other issues are being addressed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. Although he has been extubated and is doing well on supplemental oxygen, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if his lung function deteriorates or if he develops any complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Pseudomonas UTI: The patient is currently being treated with meropenem for a pseudomonas UTI. There is a risk of treatment failure or antibiotic resistance if the infection is not adequately controlled.
3. CHF exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF, and there is a risk"

   with recent broad spectrum antibiotic courses Pseudomonal UTI [**6-2**] and
   R foot infection [**7-2**] presented to [**Hospital1 **] with suprapubic pain, low
   grade fever, leukocytosis and hypotension, found to have pseudomonas
   UTI treated c miropenem, recd IVF for hypotension and developed
   pulmonary edema requiring intubation, now extubated, diuresing well c
   episode of hypotension and bradycardia this am which has resolved, for
   now, with fluid repletion.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 9721**] Pt has had CHF exacerbation and have been diuresing him
   aggresively in order to be able to extubate him. Therefore most likely
   possibility is over-diuresis. He recieved 60 of lasix IV yesterday and
   put out 1-2L. Other possibilities would be sepsis, however pt does not
   have fevers or chills or leukocytosis, nor does he report feeling sick.
   Pt also has extensive cardiac history so could consider MI, esp in the
   setting of concommittent bradycardia and EKG with LBBB and T waves
   concordant c QRS. Pt does not report chest pain, arm pain, N/V, however
   he does have DM.

   treatment with adequate antibiotics for his pseudomonas UTI. Has had
   recent fevers there is concern for worsening or new infection, but
   still without clear source. CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic
   source. No evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the

   pulmonary edema requiring intubation, now extubated, diuresing well c
   episode of hypotension and bradycardia this am which has resolved, for
   now, with fluid repletion.
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 9721**] Pt has had CHF exacerbation and have been diuresing him
   aggresively in order to be able to extubate him. Therefore most likely
   possibility is over-diuresis. He recieved 60 of lasix IV yesterday and
   put out 1-2L. Other possibilities would be sepsis, however pt does not
   have fevers or chills or leukocytosis, nor does he report feeling sick.
   Pt also has extensive cardiac history so could consider MI, esp in the
   setting of concommittent bradycardia and EKG with LBBB and T waves
   concordant c QRS. Pt does not report chest pain, arm pain, N/V, however
   he does have DM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent explantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and recurrent bloodstream infections with Candida and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). He presented to the hospital with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, and was found to have a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) treated with meropenem. He also developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation and is now extubated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30% due to a previous ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD implantation. He was aggressively fluid-resuscitated and subsequently experienced a CHF exacerbation requiring intubation. The patient has been overdiuresed with lasix yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but he had episodes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and subsequent removal due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bloodstream infections, and recent broad-spectrum antibiotic courses for pseudomonal urinary tract infection and right foot infection. The patient presented to the hospital with suprapubic pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. He was found to have a pseudomonas urinary tract infection treated with meropenem, received intravenous fluids for hypotension, and developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The patient is now extubated, diuresing well, but had an episode of hypotension and bradycardia this morning that resolved with fluid repletion.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25-30% following ventricular fibrillation arrest and ICD placement. He was aggressively fluid resuscitated and subsequently had a heart failure exacerbation requiring intubation. The patient has been overdiuresed yesterday. 

The patient also has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hyponatremia, and anemia. His electrolytes are being trended, and he is being closely monitored for any signs of infection or worsening condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings in the 80s to 100s systolic. This may indicate ongoing fluid shifts or cardiac dysfunction.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had intermittent fevers throughout his stay in the MICU despite treatment with adequate antibiotics for his pseudomonas UTI. This could indicate a new or worsening infection.
3. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's history of CHF exacerbation and aggressive diuresis may lead to further cardiac dysfunction and fluid imbalance.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously required intubation due to pulmonary edema, and there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient initially presented with a pseudomonas UTI and was treated with meropenem. However, there is a risk of developing another UTI due to the indwelling urinary catheter.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient is on heparin bridge to coumadin for his mechanical aortic valve, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes control should be monitored closely, and his glycemic levels should be maintained within target ranges.
8. Leg Ulcer: The patient has a non-healing leg ulcer, and there"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including atrioventricular replacement (AVR) and congestive heart failure (CHF). He has been admitted to the ICU for hypotension after previous intubation for respiratory failure/CHF. The patient is currently stable, with vital signs including a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He appears comfortable with no acute distress. 

24-hour events include the initiation of a multi-lumen catheter, urine culture, PICC line placement, and blood culture. The patient has received heparin sodium infusion and morphine sulfate. Allergies, review of systems, and previous medical history remain unchanged.

Flowsheet data shows fluid balance with a total input of 4,001 mL and output of 3,028 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 973 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery, with ABG results of pH 7.26. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 7.9 g/dL, leukocyte count at 234 K/uL, platelet count at 277 K/uL, creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.06 ng/mL, and glucose at 185 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range or unchanged from previous days.

Assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring for hypotension, CHF, and other ICU issues as per the ICU team. The patient's nutritional support, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and disposition have been addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating the need for close monitoring and gentle fluid boluses as needed.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF and ongoing dryness suggest the need for continuous monitoring and appropriate management.
3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to his underlying condition.
4. Infection: The initiation of a urine culture and blood culture indicates concern for potential infections. Monitoring of lab results and prompt identification and treatment of any infections are essential.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin is being provided as prophylaxis against DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH with
   AVR, CHF, in ICU for hypotension after previous intiubation for resp
   failure/CHF.  Doing well this AM
   .
   # Hypotension- Stable.  Gentle fluid boluses prn.
   # CHF: still dry but need to monitor closely
   .
   #. Fevers - Although patient has been afebrile for 24 hours at this
   time, he has spiked fevers throughout his stay in the MICU despite
   treatment with adequate antibiotics for his pseudomonas UTI. Has had
   recent fevers there is concern for worsening or new infection, but
   still without clear source. CT showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic
   source. No evidence of osteo on Xray and vascular commented that the
   wound does not look acutely infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with
   additional debridement on [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.
   - FU blood cs and micro results, pending
   - cdiff and stool cx neg
   - Will remove central line as soon as able, patient got picc yesterday
   but only single lumen
   .
   # anemia: hct down to 24 from 29 on [**8-25**]. Likely this is [**1-26**] phlebotomy
   (inc multiple blood cx). will continue to trend
   .
   .#Foot pain: will follow. If continues to be painful, will need to
   contact vascular [**Name2 (NI) 458**].
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.6. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].
   - Continue heparin until therapeutic on coumadin (INR 2.5-3.5) for 48
   hours
   -continue to order coumadin
   .
   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history including aortic valve replacement (AVR), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation support.

24-hour events include the placement of a multi-lumen catheter, urine culture, initiation of heparin infusion, blood cultures, and the start of a PICC line. The patient's allergies are limited to no known drug allergies. Medications include heparin, morphine sulfate, and meropenem.

Review of systems reveals no fever, chest pain, or abdominal pain. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. Right lower extremity edema is present, and the patient exhibits warm skin. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, following simple commands, and responding appropriately. However, movement, tone, and sensory assessments are not performed.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, increased creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and"
