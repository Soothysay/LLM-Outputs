   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:  Mostly in sinus rhythm with prolonged PR interval,
   frequent PACs and rare PVCs.  Long run of symptomatic VT at 22:23 on
   tele which converted back to SR w/o ICD firing.  5 beats of NSVT at
   2300.  Right groin hematoma stable.  On heparin gtt and Coumadin.  He
   is very anxious and is concerned that he will go back into VT and get
   shocked.  He had difficulty sleeping and required Ambien, Ativan, and
   clonazepam.

   59 yo M x-fer from CMC w/ repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple
   ICD firings, s/p EPS with successful ablation of some but not all foci
   requiring multiple defibrillations during procedure, now on lidocaine
   ggt and amiodarone.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min. There are two distinct morphologies of his arrythmia, likely
   one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral valve area (he
   has [**Month/Year (2) 9226**] and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of some but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT which broke on its own without
   defibrillation
   - Heparin drip with bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Metoprolol 50mg PO BID
   - Continue lidocaine drip at 2mg/min and amiodarone 400mg TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - EP today?

   # MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9226**]: Consider consulting cardiothoracic surgery for mitral
   valve replacement

   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has rate controlled atrial
   fibrillation and is currently on a heparin drip. Heparin drip stopped
   at 10am [**8-30**] for EPS, but continued after study.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50mg PO BID
   - Continue Heparin gtt goal PTT 60-100 (per nomogram)
   - Coumadin restarted after EPS
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Consider starting aspirin this hospitalization
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Month/Year (2) **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - recheck Cr in AM
   - Monitor UOP

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. He has been admitted to the ICU after an unsuccessful ablation procedure and initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient is currently on lidocaine and amiodarone infusions, with two distinct morphologies of arrhythmia, likely one originating from the lateral ventricle and the other from the mitral valve area.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, heart rate of 59 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal limits. His physical examination reveals a displaced PMI, irregular S1 and S2 with a blowing systolic murmur heard best at the apex, no thrills, lifts, S3, or S4. The patient has a right thigh hematoma at the catheter site without any other significant findings.

His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (11.7 K/uL), slightly decreased hemoglobin (12.8 g/dL), normal glucose levels (107 mg/dL), elevated potassium (4.4 mEq/L), and normal magnesium and phosphorus levels. His creatinine level is elevated at 1.1 mg/dL, indicating possible acute renal failure. Other lab values such as"

   59 yo M x-fer from CMC w/ repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple
   ICD firings, s/p EPS with successful ablation of some but not all foci
   requiring multiple defibrillations during procedure, now on lidocaine
   ggt and amiodarone.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min. There are two distinct morphologies of his arrythmia, likely
   one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral valve area (he
   has [**Month/Year (2) 9226**] and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of some but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT which broke on its own without
   defibrillation
   - Heparin drip with bridge to Coumadin
   - Continue Metoprolol 50mg PO BID
   - Continue lidocaine drip at 2mg/min and amiodarone 400mg TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT
   .
   Anemia:  dropped hematocrit from 44 to 36.5, will re-check hct at 1300
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has rate controlled atrial
   fibrillation and is currently on a heparin drip. Heparin drip stopped
   at 10am [**8-30**] for EPS, but continued after study.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50mg PO BID
   - Continue Heparin gtt goal PTT 60-100 (per nomogram)
   - Coumadin restarted after EPS
   - consider ECHO tomorrow
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Consider starting aspirin this hospitalization
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Month/Year (2) **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - recheck Cr in AM
   - Monitor UOP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) who was transferred from another medical center for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has had multiple episodes of VT resulting in multiple ICD firings. An electrophysiology study (EPS) was performed, which successfully ablated some but not all foci, and the patient required defibrillation several times during the procedure.

The patient currently has a prolonged PR interval, frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs), and rare premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). He experienced a long run of symptomatic VT at 22:23 on tele, which converted back to sinus rhythm without the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firing. Additionally, the patient had 5 beats of nonsustained VT at 23:00.

The patient's right groin hematoma is stable, and he is on heparin and Coumadin. He is anxious about the possibility of returning to VT and being shocked. As a result, he had difficulty sleeping and required Ambien, Ativan, and clonazepam.

The patient's allergies include monosodium glutamate. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**Date**] at 10:00 PM. He is receiving several infusions, including heparin sodium and lidocaine. Other medications include famotidine and various ICU medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. He has undergone an unsuccessful ablation procedure and failed initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient is currently on lidocaine and amiodarone for arrhythmia management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 116/63 to 127/70 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.4°C (99.4°F), while the current temperature is slightly lower at 35.7°C (96.3°F).

The patient's cardiac examination reveals a displaced PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, with irregular S1 and S2 sounds and a blowing systolic murmur heard best at the apex. No thrills, lifts, S3, or S4 are present.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL, sodium level of 107 mg/dL, potassium level of 1.1 mg/dL, chloride level of 19 mEq/L, magnesium level of 16"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. He has undergone an unsuccessful ablation procedure and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient is currently on lidocaine and amiodarone. He presented with a run of symptomatic sustained VT, which resolved on its own without defibrillation. The patient has a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral stenosis. His renal function is compromised, likely due to arrhythmia-related volume depletion. The patient also has hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He is experiencing acute renal failure, depression, and anxiety. The patient is currently in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's history of NSVT and sustained VT indicates an increased risk for recurrent episodes, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Acute renal failure: The compromised renal function may progress to further deterioration, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rate-controlled atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to an increased risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
4. Mitral valve disease: The patient's mitral valve prolapse and sten"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. He underwent an unsuccessful ablation procedure and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient is currently on lidocaine drip, amiodarone, and metoprolol. He experienced multiple episodes of VT resulting in multiple ICD firings, and one VT focus was successfully ablated but not all foci. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, OSA, hyperlipidemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 45-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89-134 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 8-25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the episodes of VT. The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant gentleman in no acute distress, oriented x3, with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, no JVP, no murmurs, and no peripheral edema. The patient's labs show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit within normal range, slightly elevated platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and he is currently on a cardiac diet. The patient's medication regimen includes lidocaine, amiodarone, metoprolol, famotidine, fentanyl, Tylenol, Clonazepam, and Effexor. The patient's prognosis and potential medical complications will depend on the effectiveness of his current treatment plan and any further interventions that may be required."

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo M x-fer from CMC w/ repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple
   ICD firings, s/p EPS with successful ablation of one VT focus, but not
   all foci requiring multiple defibrillations during procedure, now on
   lidocaine ggt and amiodarone.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min. There are two distinct morphologies of his arrythmia, likely
   one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral valve area (he
   has MVP and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of one but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and
   another run the AM of [**8-31**] which broke on its own without defibrillation
   - Continue heparin drip, Coumadin held yesterday
   - Increase Metoprolol to 75mg PO TID up from 50mg PO TID
   - Continue lidocaine drip at 2mg/min and amiodarone 400mg TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT
   .
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit continues to drop from 44 on admission to 33
   -Likely hemodilution, but consider CT scan to rule out retroperitoneal
   bleed, will re-check hct at 1300
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has rate controlled atrial
   fibrillation and is currently on a heparin drip. Heparin drip stopped
   at 10am [**8-30**] for EPS, but continued after study.
   - Increase Metoprolol to 75mg PO TID
   - Continue Heparin gtt goal PTT 60-100 (per nomogram)
   - Hold Coumadin due to unknown bleeding source
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Consider starting aspirin this hospitalization once anemia resolves
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Month/Year (2) **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - Cr now down to 1
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety:
   - Continue Effexor 75mg PO Daily (although this drug does prolong Qt
   interval)
   - Continue Clonazepam 0.5mg PO TID PRN
   - Ambien prn Sleep

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after an unsuccessful ablation procedure for VT and initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. 

The patient's current medications include lidocaine drip at 2mg/min, amiodarone 400mg TID, metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID, and famotidine. The patient also has a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation, but it was stopped for the electrophysiology (EP) study and restarted afterward.

The patient's recent events include symptomatic sustained VT with a rate in the 130s yesterday morning, which was treated with lidocaine and amiodarone. The EP evaluated the ICD and changed the overdrive pace rate to 125.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male who was transferred from another medical center with repeated episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has undergone an unsuccessful ablation procedure. He is currently being treated with lidocaine and amiodarone for his VT episodes. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, anemia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's history of sustained VT and multiple ICD firings indicate a high risk of recurrent VT episodes. It is crucial to monitor his heart rhythm closely and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rate-controlled atrial fibrillation requires close monitoring of his heart rate and blood pressure. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin or other anticoagulants may be necessary to prevent thromboembolic events.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels continue to drop, indicating ongoing hemodilution. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and transfusing blood products if necessary is essential to maintain adequate oxygen delivery.

4. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient's OSA should be managed with home CPAP therapy. Monitoring for any respiratory complications and ensuring proper usage of CPAP equipment is important.

5. Hyperlipidemia: Although the"

   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min. There are two distinct morphologies of his arrythmia, likely
   one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral valve area (he
   has MVP and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - Stop lidocaine drip today
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of one but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and
   another run the AM of [**8-31**] which broke on its own without defibrillation
   - Restart on home coumadin.  D/C heparin gtt
   - Increase Metoprolol to 75mg PO TID up from 50mg PO TID
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT

   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has rate controlled atrial
   fibrillation and is currently on a heparin drip. Heparin drip stopped
   at 10am [**8-30**] for EPS, but continued after study.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia and is currently in the ICU. He experienced episodes of VT yesterday morning and was treated with lidocaine and amiodarone. His Lopressor was increased to 50mg TID. The patient's ICD was evaluated and the overdrive pace rate was changed to 125. The patient remains anxious about his heart rhythm. Home CPAP was started for OSA.

Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with sustained VT episodes. He underwent an unsuccessful ablation and initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. He continues to experience VT despite treatment with lidocaine and amiodarone.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has been dropping from 44 on admission to 33, likely due to hemodilution. This will be rechecked at 1300.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has rate-controlled atrial fibrillation and is currently on a heparin drip. The heparin drip will be stopped today and the patient will be restarted on his home coumadin.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has been increasing, indicating possible acute renal failure. The etiology is likely due to arrhythmia."

The patient is a 74-inch tall, 93.8 kg individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of palpitations. The patient has a history of monosodium glutamate allergy, and their last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is currently on various infusions and other medications. There are no significant changes to the medical and family history, and the review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for palpitations. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/45 to 124/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is stable, with a current weight of 93.8 kg and an admission weight of 92.7 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,048 mL, including 660 mL via PO, 388 mL via IVF, and 0 mL via other routes. Total output includes 1,805 mL of urine, 0 mL of NG, 0 mL of stool, and 0 mL from drains, resulting in a negative balance of 757 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred from another medical center after an unsuccessful ablation of VT foci. The patient has been experiencing repeated episodes of VT, for which he received multiple defibrillations during the procedure. He is currently on amiodarone and metoprolol for rate control.

The patient's hematocrit dropped from 44 on admission to 33, likely due to hemodilution. Haptoglobin levels are normal, indicating no hemolysis. Stool guaiac test is negative. The patient has rate-controlled atrial fibrillation and was previously on a heparin drip, but now he is on home coumadin.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, acute renal failure, depression/anxiety, and hypertension. His creatinine levels were initially elevated but have improved. His urine output is good. The patient is also being treated for hyperlipidemia and has a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of sustained VT and repeated episodes during the procedure indicate a high risk for recurrent VT.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rate-controlled atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke or"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. He underwent an unsuccessful ablation and initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient is currently on amiodarone and has had multiple episodes of VT requiring defibrillations.

2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33, likely due to hemodilution. However, the repeat Hct is stable at 33.4, and haptoglobin levels do not support hemolysis. Stool guaiac is negative, ruling out gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient defibrillated back into sinus rhythm and will be started on heparin SC with a bridge to Coumadin. The INR was subtherapeutic at 1.8, so the Coumadin dose will be increased to 5mg today.

4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient was restarted on home CPAP, but he finds the mask uncomfortable. He has been explained the benefits of continuous CPAP use.

5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing repeated episodes of VT and underwent an electrophysiology study (EPS) with successful ablation of one VT focus. However, not all foci were ablated, and the patient required multiple defibrillations during the procedure. He was initially on lidocaine and amiodarone but is now only on amiodarone.

The patient has a history of NSVT with sustained VT episodes and has had an ICD placement. He was transferred from another medical center after an unsuccessful ablation and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate. His most recent event occurred yesterday when he went into a run of symptomatic sustained VT, which broke on its own without defibrillation.

Other medical issues include anemia, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and acute renal failure. The anemia is likely due to hemodilution, and the atrial fibrillation has been rate-controlled. The patient's renal function has improved, with a creatinine level now at 1.0.

The patient also has a history of depression/anxiety and is taking Effexor, clonazepam, and ambien as needed for sleep. He is on a cardiac diet and has prophylaxis"

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He was transferred from another medical center after an unsuccessful ablation procedure for VT and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient initially received lidocaine drip, which was restarted due to recurrent VT episodes. He underwent an electrophysiology study (EPS) on 08/30, where one focus of VT was successfully ablated but not all foci. The patient required defibrillation multiple times during the procedure. Post-procedure, he experienced symptomatic sustained VT, which resolved on its own without defibrillation. His hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 44% on admission to 33%, likely due to hemodilution. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, and he is currently on coumadin. He also has anemia, hyperlipidemia, and acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal failure caused by volume depletion. The patient's mental health history includes depression/anxiety, for which he is receiving medication. He is also being managed for pain, bowel regimen, and DVT prophylaxis. His code status is full code, and he is likely to be transferred out of the CCU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the ICU after repeated episodes of ventricular tachycardia and unsuccessful ablation procedure. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, and simvastatin. He also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, depression/anxiety, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/65 mmHg to 122/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for a right thigh hematoma at the catheterization site.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, but his liver function tests are slightly elevated. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging studies are not mentioned in the progress note.

Plan:

The patient's current plan includes continued use of amiodarone for arrhythmia management, increased dose of metoprolol to control heart rate,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He was transferred from another medical center after unsuccessful ablation and initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of VT and AFib, which have resulted in multiple defibrillator firings.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone 400mg TID, metoprolol 75mg PO TID, and diltiazem 30mg QID. He also has an order for heparin IV gtt as a bridge to Coumadin 5mg due to a subtherapeutic INR of 1.7.

The patient's physical examination findings are as follows:
- General: Pleasant gentleman in NAD (normal appearance and demeanor), appears comfortable, oriented x3, mood and affect appropriate.
- HEENT: NCAT (normal cranial arteries and tension), sclera anicteric, PERRL (pupils equal and round), EOMI (eyes move in all directions), pink conjunctiva, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, no lymphadenopathy.
- NECK: Supple with JVP (jugular venous pressure) of 5 cm.
- CARDIAC: PMI (point of maximal impulse) displaced laterally, located in 5th intercostal space, S1 and S2 regular rate, blowing systolic murmur heard best at apex, no thrills, lifts, S3 or S4.
- LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis, unlabored respiration, no accessory muscle use, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
- ABDOMEN: Soft, NT/ND (no tenderness or distension), no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo M x-fer from CMC w/ repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple
   ICD firings, s/p EPS with successful ablation of one VT focus, but not
   all foci requiring multiple defibrillations during procedure, initially
   on lidocaine ggt and amiodarone, now just on amiodarone.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min, currently off. There are two distinct morphologies of his
   arrythmia, likely one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral
   valve area (he has MVP and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - lidocaine drip stopped [**2118-8-31**]
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of one but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and
   another run the AM of [**8-31**] which broke on its own without defibrillation
   - Went back into A fib yesterday which triggered some non-sustained
   polymorphic VT
   - INR =1.7 this AM, so will need to start heparin IV gtt as bridge to
   Coumadin 5mg.
   - Metoprolol was increased to 75mg PO TID [**2118-9-1**], Diltiazem 30mg QID
   started on [**9-2**]
   - Aggressive magnesium repletion
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg TID taper to 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] after one week at
   TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT
   .
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33
   -Likely hemodilution.  Repeat Hct this AM is 35.
   -Haptoglobin of 251 which does not support a hemolysis
   - stool guaiac negative
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has defibrillated back into sinus
   rhythm and will be started on heparin IV gtt with bridge to Coumadin.
   Will change coumadin dose to 5mg today as INR was subtherapeutic at 1.7
   this AM.
   - Cont metoprolol at 75mg PO TID
   - heparin IV-> coumadin 5mg
   .
   #OSA- restarted on home CPAP
   -Pt states the mask is uncomfortable but the one at home is a better
   fit. Pt was explained the benefits of using his CPAP continuously
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Hospital1 **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - ARF now resolved, Cr now down to 1
   - Monitor UOP
   -Pt is urinating well
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety:
   - Continue Effexor 75mg PO Daily (although this drug does prolong Qt
   interval)
   - Continue Clonazepam 0.5mg PO TID PRN
   - Ambien prn Sleep
   - Ativan PRN for anxiety

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) episodes. He has undergone an electrophysiology study (EPS) with successful ablation of one VT focus but not all foci, requiring multiple defibrillations during the procedure. The patient is currently on amiodarone and had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure, as well as another episode of VT that resolved on its own.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) and was defibrillated back into sinus rhythm. He will be started on heparin IV gtt with a bridge to Coumadin due to a subtherapeutic INR of 1.7. Metoprolol was increased to 75mg PO TID, and Diltiazem 30mg QID was started.

Other medical conditions mentioned in the note include anemia, likely due to hemodilution, with a hematocrit dropping from 44 on admission to 33 and now at 35. The haptoglobin level of 251 does not support hemolysis, and the stool guaiac is negative. 

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and will restart home CPAP. He also has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of coronary artery disease. 

The patient had acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4 at OSH, 1.1 at admission, and 1.2 on 8/30. The etiology is likely due to arrhythmia. The urine lytes were ordered, and FeNa=0.6, indicating pre-renal failure likely due to volume depletion. The ARF is now resolved with a current creatinine level of 1.0. 

Lastly, the patient has depression/anxiety and is on various medications including Effexor, Clonazepam, Ambien, and Ativan.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of NSVT and sustained VT episodes, and despite ablation and medication, he continues to experience VT episodes.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has ongoing AF with recurrences since going back into AF.
3. Acute renal failure: Although currently resolved, the patient had a creatinine level of 1.4 initially and required further evaluation and management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 44 to 33 and is currently at 35. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is warranted.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of coronary artery disease. Long-term management of hyperlipidemia is important to prevent cardiovascular complications.
6. Depression/anxiety: The patient is on multiple medications for depression/anxiety, indicating ongoing management of these conditions."

 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA)
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   59 yo M x-fer from CMC w/ repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple
   ICD firings, s/p EPS with successful ablation of one VT focus, but not
   all foci requiring multiple defibrillations during procedure, initially
   on lidocaine ggt and amiodarone, now just on amiodarone.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min, currently off. There are two distinct morphologies of his
   arrythmia, likely one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral
   valve area (he has MVP and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - lidocaine drip stopped [**2118-8-31**]
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of one but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and
   another run the AM of [**8-31**] which broke on its own without defibrillation
   - Went back into A fib yesterday which triggered some non-sustained
   polymorphic VT
   - INR =1.7 this AM, so will need to start heparin IV gtt as bridge to
   Coumadin 5mg.
   - Metoprolol was increased to 75mg PO TID [**2118-9-1**], Diltiazem 30mg QID
   started on [**9-2**]
   - Aggressive magnesium repletion
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg TID taper to 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] after one week at
   TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT
   .
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33
   -Likely hemodilution.  Repeat Hct this AM is 35.
   -Haptoglobin of 251 which does not support a hemolysis
   - stool guaiac negative
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has defibrillated back into sinus
   rhythm and will be started on heparin IV gtt with bridge to Coumadin.
   Will change coumadin dose to 5mg today as INR was subtherapeutic at 1.7
   this AM.
   - Cont metoprolol at 75mg PO TID
   - heparin IV-> coumadin 5mg
   .
   #OSA- restarted on home CPAP
   -Pt states the mask is uncomfortable but the one at home is a better
   fit. Pt was explained the benefits of using his CPAP continuously
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Hospital1 **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - ARF now resolved, Cr now down to 1
   - Monitor UOP
   -Pt is urinating well
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety:
   - Continue Effexor 75mg PO Daily (although this drug does prolong Qt
   interval)
   - Continue Clonazepam 0.5mg PO TID PRN
   - Ambien prn Sleep
   - Ativan PRN for anxiety
   .

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ventricular tachycardia, and sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. He has been transferred from another medical center after unsuccessful ablation of VT foci and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient initially received a lidocaine drip but was taken off due to breakthrough VT. He was given 200mg of lidocaine at 4-50mg boluses with the rate of gtt increased from 1mg/min to 2mg/min. Currently, the patient is not on any antiarrhythmic medication.

The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) was successfully converted back to sinus rhythm, and he will be started on heparin IV gtt with a bridge to Coumadin. The INR was subtherapeutic at 1.7 this morning, so the Coumadin dose will be increased to 5mg today.

The patient's anemia is likely due to hemodilution. His hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33, but repeat Hct this morning is 35. Haptoglobin of 251 does not support hemolysis, and stool guaiac is negative.

The patient's hyperlipidemia has been identified, but there is no evidence of coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin due to his warfarin"

   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min, currently off. There are two distinct morphologies of his
   arrythmia, likely one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral
   valve area (he has MVP and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - lidocaine drip stopped [**2118-8-31**]
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of one but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and
   another run the AM of [**8-31**] which broke on its own without defibrillation
   - Went back into A fib yesterday which triggered some non-sustained
   polymorphic VT
   - INR =1.7 this AM, so on heparin IV gtt as bridge to Coumadin 5mg
   (will give extra 7.5 mg dose today)
   - change metoprolol 75 mg TID to sustained release 100 mg in AM
   - change diltiazem to SR 240 mg qdaily in PM (for triggered ectopy)
   - Aggressive magnesium repletion (on magnesium oxide)
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg TID taper to 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] after one week at
   TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT
   .
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33
   -Likely hemodilution.  Repeat Hct this AM is 35.
   -Haptoglobin of 251 which does not support a hemolysis
   - stool guaiac negative
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has defibrillated back into sinus
   rhythm and will be started on heparin IV gtt with bridge to Coumadin.
   Will change coumadin dose to 5mg today as INR was subtherapeutic at 1.7
   this AM.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - heparin IV-> coumadin 5mg
   - will give extra 7.5 mg coumadin dose today
   .
   #OSA- restarted on home CPAP
   -Pt states the mask is uncomfortable but the one at home is a better
   fit. Pt was explained the benefits of using his CPAP continuously
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Hospital1 **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - ARF now resolved, Cr now down to 1.3
   - Monitor UOP
   -Pt is urinating well
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety:
   - Continue Effexor 75mg PO Daily (although this drug does prolong Qt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sustained VT episodes. He was transferred from another hospital after an unsuccessful ablation procedure and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient has been on amiodarone and had multiple defibrillator firings during the procedure. He experienced symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and another episode of non-sustained polymorphic VT yesterday.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which triggered some non-sustained polymorphic VT. His INR was subtherapeutic at 1.7 this morning, so he is being bridged from heparin IV to Coumadin with an extra 7.5 mg dose today.

The patient also has anemia, with hematocrit initially dropping from 44 on admission to 33. This is likely due to hemodilution. His haptoglobin level is normal, indicating no evidence of hemolysis. The stool guaiac test is negative.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hyperlipidemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and acute renal failure. His renal function has now resolved, with creatinine down to 1.3. He is currently on amiodarone, metoprolol, diltiazem, magnesium oxide, and he"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes, and multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) firings. He was transferred from another hospital after an unsuccessful ablation procedure and initiation of sotalol to control his heart rate. The patient has been on amiodarone and lidocaine therapy, with episodes of symptomatic sustained VT and atrial fibrillation.

Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a long-standing history of NSVT with episodes of sustained VT. Despite ICD placement, he continues to experience recurrent VT episodes, requiring multiple defibrillations during the ablation procedure. There are two distinct morphologies of his arrhythmia, likely originating from the lateral ventricle and the mitral valve area.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, which triggered non-sustained polymorphic VT. His INR is subtherapeutic at 1.7, and he will be started on heparin IV gtt as a bridge to Coumadin (warfarin) therapy.

 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA)
 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   59 yo M x-fer from CMC w/ repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple
   ICD firings, s/p EPS with successful ablation of one VT focus, but not
   all foci requiring multiple defibrillations during procedure, initially
   on lidocaine ggt and amiodarone, now just on amiodarone.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a [**1-28**] year history of NSVT
   with Sustained Ventricular tachycardia episodes and is s/p ICD
   placement. He was transferred from CMC after an unsuccessful ablation
   ([**8-24**]) and unsuccessful initiation of sotalol to control his rate.
   Initially was on lidocaine ggt, EP wanted drip off for study, but pt
   went back into VT, so drip was restarted. [**8-30**] he received 200mg
   lidocaine at 4- 50mg boluses with rate of ggt increased from 1mg/min to
   2mg/min, currently off. There are two distinct morphologies of his
   arrythmia, likely one coming from lateral ventricle and one from mitral
   valve area (he has MVP and MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
   - lidocaine drip stopped [**2118-8-31**]
   - EPS [**8-30**] was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
   successful ablation of one but not all foci, patient required
   defibrillation several times during procedure
   - Had a run of symptomatic sustained VT following the procedure and
   another run the AM of [**8-31**] which broke on its own without defibrillation
   - Went back into A fib yesterday which triggered some non-sustained
   polymorphic VT
   - INR =1.7 this AM, so will need to start heparin IV gtt as bridge to
   Coumadin 5mg.
   - Metoprolol was increased to 75mg PO TID [**2118-9-1**], Diltiazem 30mg QID
   started on [**9-2**]
   - Aggressive magnesium repletion
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg TID taper to 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] after one week at
   TID
   - Hold home verapamil
   - Telemetry
   - Nitro prn chest pain
   - Maintain K>4, Mg>2
   - Obtain 12 lead EKG if he goes back into VT
   .
   # Anemia:  Hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33
   -Likely hemodilution.  Repeat Hct this AM is 35.
   -Haptoglobin of 251 which does not support a hemolysis
   - stool guaiac negative
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has defibrillated back into sinus
   rhythm and will be started on heparin IV gtt with bridge to Coumadin.
   Will change coumadin dose to 5mg today as INR was subtherapeutic at 1.7
   this AM.
   - Cont metoprolol at 75mg PO TID
   - heparin IV-> coumadin 5mg
   .
   #OSA- restarted on home CPAP
   -Pt states the mask is uncomfortable but the one at home is a better
   fit. Pt was explained the benefits of using his CPAP continuously
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia- The patient has hyperlipidemia but no evidence of
   coronary artery disease. He has not been on aspirin because of his
   warfarin dosing.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # Hypertropic cardiomyopathy- As per recent [**Hospital1 **], preserved EF= 55-60%
   and no signs of failure.
   - Continue Metoprolol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: etiology likely due to arrhythmia. Cr was 1.4 at
   OSH, 1.1 at admission, 1.2 on [**8-30**]. Urine lytes ordered, FeNa=0.6,
   indicating pre-renal failure likely [**2-28**] volume depletion.
   - ARF now resolved, Cr now down to 1
   - Monitor UOP
   -Pt is urinating well
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety:
   - Continue Effexor 75mg PO Daily (although this drug does prolong Qt
   interval)
   - Continue Clonazepam 0.5mg PO TID PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to repeated episodes of VT resulting in multiple ICD firings. The patient underwent an electrophysiology study with successful ablation of one VT focus, but not all foci. He is currently on amiodarone for VT control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with sustained VT episodes. He underwent an unsuccessful ablation and initiation of sotalol. The patient requires continuous monitoring and management of his VT, including the use of antiarrhythmic medications and consideration for additional ablation procedures if necessary.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events. The patient is being started on heparin IV followed by Coumadin to maintain therapeutic INR levels and reduce the risk of thromboembolism.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit initially dropped from 44 to 33, but repeat Hct this morning is 35. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the anemia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level was elevated from"

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. He has undergone an electrophysiological study (EPS) with successful ablation of one ventricular tachycardia focus but not all foci. The patient has been experiencing repeated episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which have resulted in multiple ICD firings.

The patient was initially on lidocaine drip but it was stopped. He then received 200mg of lidocaine at 4-50mg boluses with the rate of infusion increased from 1mg/min to 2mg/min. Currently, the patient is off the lidocaine drip. He has been experiencing runs of symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia, including one episode that broke on its own without defibrillation.

The patient also had a run of atrial fibrillation yesterday, which triggered some nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. His INR is subtherapeutic at 1.7, so he will be started on heparin IV gtt as a bridge to Coumadin. The Coumadin dose will be increased to 5mg today.

The patient has a history of anemia, likely due to hemodilution. His hematocrit initially dropped from 44 on admission to 33."
