","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT (bone marrow transplant) and is now presenting with febrile neutropenia and sinopulmonary symptoms. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics by the BMT service and transferred to the ICU due to acute onset of hypoxia and worsening cough. The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, sinusitis, GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), and a previous diagnosis of CMV colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rapidly progressive pneumonia: The patient's recent chest CT showed abnormalities, which could indicate a rapidly progressive pneumonia. Hemorrhage and aspiration should also be considered as potential causes.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has developed a small right pleural effusion, which could be related to the pneumonia or other underlying conditions.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results indicate imbalances in potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium levels. Monitoring electrolytes and repleting as needed is necessary to prevent complications associated with these imbalances.
4. Worsening hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is stable in the low 90s on high-flow nasal cannula. There is a concern about worsening hypoxia, which could be due to pneumonia, fluid overload, or pulmonary edema.
5. Infection control: The patient is on multiple proph"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplant) and is presenting with febrile neutropenia and sinopulmonary symptoms. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transferred to the ICU due to acute onset of hypoxia and worsening cough.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 158/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and thin build. The patient has normal breath sounds with diffuse bilateral rhonchi but improved from yesterday. His peripheral pulses are absent in both right and left upper extremities. Neurologic examination shows that he responds appropriately but movement, tone, and sensation are not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate a WBC count of 1.5 K/uL, Hct of 26.6%, platelet count of 74 K/uL, Cr of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 253 mg/dL. Other labs show abnormalities in PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, albumin, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 levels. Imaging reveals rapid development of multifocal airspace opacities, new small right pleural effusion, and mild interstitial edema. Microbiology shows GNR and coag+ staph in sputum.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Neutropenic fever/pneumonia: The patient's worsening pneumonia along with GNR and coag+ staph in sputum suggests a bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn and amikacin) have been initiated, which fits his sensitivity profile. Nafcillin has been changed for MSSA in sputum. Diurese with goal I/O negative 1-2 liters today and platelet goal TX if <50 are also planned.
- ID: Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. Valgancyclovir maintenance therapy for CMV colitis and other medications for hepatitis B virus and prophylaxis against fungal infections are continued.
- Sinusitis: Improving on abx.
- Lymphoma: On maintenance Rituxan therapy as outpatient.
- GVHD: Prednisone at 20mg daily is continued.
- FEN: Monitoring electrolytes and repleting as needed.
- PPx: Pneumoboots are used, and PPI is continued at home.
- Access: Right-sided port.
- Code: Full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding due to low platelet count, and possible aspiration or hemorrhage given the rapid development of airspace opacities on imaging."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of cough.
- He has a history of lymphoma and underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with subsequent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
- The patient presented to the clinic with a productive cough, febrile neutropenia, and worsening hypoxemia.
- He was admitted to the floor and then transferred to the ICU due to worsening respiratory condition.
- In the ICU, the patient received pulse steroids for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).
- He has allergies to cefepime, levaquin, and meropenem.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115-136 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on high-flow oxygen.
- The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe of the lungs, as well as a diffuse dry scaling rash on the skin.
- Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus (PSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
- The patient's condition is critically ill, and he requires respiratory support with high-flow oxygen and other ICU interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxemia, crackles in the lungs, and history of DAH suggest a high risk of respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and support with respiratory therapies, such as non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation, may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukopenia, and positive blood cultures indicate a possible bacterial infection, which can lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, organ function, and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): Although the patient is already receiving prednisone for GVHD, the ongoing presence of skin rash and respiratory symptoms suggest ongoing immune-mediated damage. Adjustments to immunosuppressive therapy may be required.
4. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's recent treatment for DAH indicates a risk for recurrence. Continued surveillance and prompt management of any signs of bleeding or respiratory deterioration are essential.
5. Thrombotic Events: The patient's thrombocyt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplant) and is presenting with febrile neutropenia and sinopulmonary symptoms. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transferred to the ICU due to acute hypoxia and worsening cough. The patient has a history of pseudomonas infection resistant to multiple antibiotics, and he is currently being treated with Zosyn and amikacin. His lab results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 1.5, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 69, and elevated glucose levels at 253 mg/dL. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the right middle and lower lung fields posteriorly. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough and worsening respiratory status suggest a possible pneumonia. The presence of GNR and coag + staph in the sputum supports this diagnosis. Changing antibiotic coverage to ceftazidime and Zosyn is appropriate given the sensitivity profile.
2. Sinusitis: The patient's symptoms of sinus infection are improving on antibiotic therapy.
3. GVHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease): The patient has known GVHD involving the skin and liver."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) presenting with respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (PSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, amikacin, aztreonam, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm (normal range: 54-113 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 160/91 mmHg (normal range: 130/84-166/108 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-35 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on face tent

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation support and is receiving oxygen through a face tent.

Physical examination findings include crackles in the right lower lung fields, absent peripheral pulses in the right lower extremity, and warm skin.

Laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 1.5 K/uL
- Platelet count: 90 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
- Glucose: 253 mg/dL
- Other lab results including PT/PTT/INR, liver function tests, electrolytes, and albumin levels are within normal ranges.

Imaging shows more diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's main concerns are respiratory distress and pneumonia caused by PSA/MSSA. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin and amikacin while continuing aztreonam and Zosyn. The patient will also continue receiving medications for graft versus host disease (GVDH)/BMT and ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's respiratory distress and being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Line-related infection: The presence of a tunneled Hickman line increases the risk of line-related infections.
3. Graft versus host disease (GVDH): As the patient has undergone bone marrow transplantation, there is a risk of developing GVDH, which can affect various organs and systems.
4. Antibiotic resistance: The patient is already infected with MSSA, a type of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There is a possibility of developing resistance to other antibiotics being used.
5. Septic shock: Given the patient's critical condition and ongoing infection, there is a risk of septic shock, characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma, who has undergone an allo-BMT (allogeneic bone marrow transplant) and is presenting with febrile neutropenia and sinopulmonary symptoms. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics on the BMT service and later transferred to the ICU due to acute onset of hypoxia and worsening cough. The patient has pneumonia caused by MSSA and pseudomonas, for which he is being treated with Zosyn and Aztreonam for a two-week course. His current condition is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% on high flow neb. The patient also has known GVHD (graft-versus-host disease) of both skin and liver, for which he is receiving prednisone. Other ongoing treatments include prophylaxis with posaconazole and atovaquone, monitoring electrolytes, and repleting as needed. The patient's code status is confirmed as full.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has pneumonia caused by MSSA and pseudomonas, and he is already being treated with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of further infections due to his compromised immune system as a result of the bone marrow transplant and GVHD.

2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. The plan is to provide platelet transfusion if the plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma, who underwent an allo-BMT and is presenting with febrile neutropenia and sinopulmonary symptoms. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transferred to the ICU due to acute onset of hypoxia and worsening cough. The patient's breathing has improved, and he is taking good oral intake. Allergies include cefepime and levaquin. The patient received multiple antibiotics until the last dose of meropenem on 07/05/2115 at 06:39 PM. Cultures are positive for MSSA and pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn. The patient will continue on zosyn/aztreonam for a two-week course. The plan includes diuresis with a goal of input/output negative one liter today, reassessing later in the day, platelet goal TX if less than 50, and following up on final culture results. The patient's hypoxia is currently stable, and he is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. ENT should evaluate for the need of sinus surgical intervention as the sinus may be the primary source for this pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic neutropenia. He presented with pneumonia (pna) caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA). Antibiotic therapy was changed multiple times due to allergies and ineffective treatment.

The patient's respiratory support has been improved from non-rebreather mask (NRB) to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50%. He received a single dose of Solumedrol 500mg for possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), then returned to his outpatient dose of prednisone 20mg daily for GVHD.

The patient's allergies include cefepime and levaquin. The last doses of antibiotics administered were meropenem on 07/05/2115 at 06:39 PM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 07/06/2115 at 12:00 PM, amikacin on 07/07/2115 at 08:09 AM, vancomycin on 07/07/2115 at 08:10 AM, piperacillin on 07/07/2115 at 06:02 PM, and aztreonam on 07"

The patient presented with pneumonia (pna) and had multiple antibiotic changes, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (zosyn), tobramycin, aztreonam, and meropenem. The patient's cough has improved, and they are now on high-flow nasal oxygen (neb) at 50%. The patient received Solumedrol 500mg for possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and was then returned to their outpatient dose of prednisone 20mg qd for GVHD.

The patient's allergies include cefepime and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2C (97.2F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/88mmHg to 161/102mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow neb.

   pseudomonal and MSSA pneumonia.
   # Pneumonia: Cultures + for MSSA and pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn.
   -on zosyn / aztreonam for pseudomonas and MSSA in sputum x 2 week
   course
   - F/U ID recs- ? d/c aztreonam
   -hold off further diuresis
   -hypoxia is currently stable, sating 100 on a high flow neb, decrease
   O2
   # ID: as above.
   - last CMV viral load was negative. Therefore hold on further
   valgancyclovir given low counts
   -continue lamivudine for borderline + HBV core ab, his vl was negative
   -Fungal ppx with posaconazole
   -PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ atovaquone
   # Sinusitis: improving on abx.
   # Lymphoma: On maintenance Rituxan therapy as outpatient.
   - Continue prophylaxis with posaconazole, atorvaquone
   # GVHD: Has known GVHD of both skin and liver.
   - Continue prednisone as above  at 20mg daily
   # FEN: monitoring electrolytes and repleting as needed.
   # PPx: Continuing home PPI,  bowel regimen as needed, pneumoboots, hold

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of follicular lymphoma who underwent an allo-BMT (bone marrow transplant) and is currently experiencing GVH (graft-versus-host) disease. The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal and MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) pneumonia. Cultures have confirmed that the organism is sensitive to zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), so the patient is being treated with zosyn and aztreonam for a 2-week course.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/83 to 158/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) results indicate adequate oxygenation. Physical examination reveals crackles in the left base of the lungs and diminished breath sounds at the left base and right middle lung field. Neurological assessment shows the patient to be attentive and oriented.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Renal function tests indicate normal creatinine levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and albumin, are"
