   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever: Concern for infection vs inflammatory response.
   Only localizing symptom is hypoxia with subjective difficulty
   breathing.  No cough.  CXR is consistent with volume overload vs
   possible multifocal infiltrates/pneumonia.  No urinary symptoms.  Blood
   cultures are pending.  Received broad spectrum antibiotics in the ED.
   Currently hemodynamically stable.  Was intermittently febrile during
   his last admission to 103 with no found source of infection.  Nasal flu
   swab was negative.  Also concern for line infection with PICC line in
   place.  Picc line removed, with patient continuing to have fevers
   overnight.  Other cause of fever might be central source given damage
   to spinal cord or serotonin syndrome (possibly from paxil).
   - will cont vanco, cefepime, and levo for now
   - may need BAL to obtain good sputum sample
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC trend
   - f/u CT chest
   # Hypoxia:  Increased O2 requirement associated with fever and
   leukocytosis is concerning for pneumonia.  CXR was read as moderate
   pulmonary edema and interval worsening of his bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue current vent settings unless clinical change; check ABG
   today
   - Diurese today with goal 2L neg
   - CT chest this AM to better evaluate for consolidation versus
   loculated effusions
   - if unable to get a sputum sample, may need to do a BAL
   - albuterol MDI
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is erythematous, could be consistent with
   cellulitis versus irritation from staples.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # R common femoral DVT:  INR is still subtherapeutic (1.3) despite high
   dose coumadin.  Being bridged with lovenox. IVC filter in place.
   - hold coumadin for now
   - cont lovenox bridge until INR within goal of [**12-31**]
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on
   paxil.  He is unsure about his medication regimen.
   - continue paxil but decrease dose to 50 daily
   - will re-address other medications with the patient as he stabilizes

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest potential medical complications that can arise from his condition. 

1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient shows signs of infection versus an inflammatory response. This could indicate pneumonia or another type of infection. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The source of infection remains unclear.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's increased O2 requirement associated with fever and leukocytosis raises concern for pneumonia. The CXR shows moderate pulmonary edema and worsening bilateral pleural effusions. Current ventilator settings should be monitored, and an ABG should be checked today. Diuretic therapy may be considered to remove excess fluid, and a CT chest is needed to evaluate for consolidation versus loculated effusions.

3. s/p C3-5 contusion: The patient has a cervical spine contusion, and it is important to continue using the [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar. Follow-up with neurosurgery is recommended as an outpatient after initial injury with a repeat MRI.

4. L femur ORIF: The patient has a left femur ORIF, and the incision is erythematous. This could be consistent with cellulitis or irritation from staples"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted to the ICU for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has been experiencing increased O2 requirement associated with fever and leukocytosis, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient's CXR shows moderate pulmonary edema and interval worsening of his bilateral pleural effusions, but it could also possibly be consistent with multifocal infiltrates. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's condition is further complicated by other comorbidities, including a s/p L femur ORIF with an erythematous incision that could be consistent with cellulitis or irritation from staples, an R common femoral DVT, and a history of bipolar disorder. The patient is being bridged with lovenox due to a subtherapeutic INR despite high-dose coumadin. An IVC filter is in place, and the patient's medication regimen prior to previous admission included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin. He is currently only on paxil.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and fever. He has a history of recent C3-C5 cord contusion, left femur ORIF, right common femoral DVT, and bipolar disorder. The patient is currently admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has been receiving treatment for pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. His vital signs include a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and pressure support of 18 cmH2O. A chest CT scan shows findings consistent with multifocal infection accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusions. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he is receiving appropriate treatment for his various medical conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:

   # Leukocytosis/Fever: Concern for infection vs inflammatory response.
   Only localizing symptom is hypoxia with subjective difficulty
   breathing.  No cough.  CT scan consistent with multifocal infection
   with small pulmonary effusions.  No urinary symptoms.  Blood cultures
   are pending.  Currently hemodynamically stable.  Nasal flu swab
   negative.  Also concern for line infection with PICC line in place.
   Picc line removed, with patient continuing to have fevers overnight.
   Other cause of fever might be central source given damage to spinal
   cord.  Unlikely serotonin syndrome from paxil
   - will cont vanco, cefepime, and levo for now
   - Hold off on BAL for now
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC trend
   # Hypoxia:  Increased O2 requirement associated with fever and
   leukocytosis is concerning for pneumonia.  CXR was read as moderate
   pulmonary edema and interval worsening of his bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   - Continue current vent settings unless clinical change; check ABG
   today
   - Continue gentle diuresis
   - albuterol MDI

   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # R common femoral DVT:  INR is still subtherapeutic (1.3) despite high
   dose coumadin.  Being bridged with lovenox. IVC filter in place.
   - hold coumadin for now
   - cont lovenox bridge until INR within goal of [**12-31**]
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fevers, and a history of C3-C5 cord contusion. He has been experiencing dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient's chest CT scan shows findings consistent with multifocal infection accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusions. Sputum culture has been sent, and no bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been performed due to the sputum culture looking good. The patient has been receiving lasix IV, decreased FiO2 from 50-40%, and increased secretions in the early morning, with culture sent.

The patient's medical history includes recent C3-C5 cord contusion, L femur ORIF, R common femoral DVT, and bipolar disorder. He is currently on multiple medications including paxil, cefepime, vancomycin, levo, enoxaparin (lovenox), furosemide (lasix), lorazepam (ativan), and morphine sulfate.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They have been experiencing respiratory distress and fevers. The chest CT shows findings consistent with multifocal infection accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusions. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, enoxaparin, furosemide, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate. Their vital signs indicate a temperature of 39.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/50 to 114/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 97%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. They also have elevated troponin T levels, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function test results.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress and has been placed on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation. There is a concern for potential respiratory failure if their condition worsens.

2. Infection: The presence of fevers, chest CT findings, and elevated white blood cell count suggest an underlying infection. It is crucial to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral small pleural eff"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-inch tall and 113.9 kg heavy individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing several medical conditions including impaired physical mobility, respiratory failure (not ARDS), quadriplegia, pain control (acute and chronic pain), and fever of unknown origin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
- Heart rate: 59 bpm (with a normal range of 57-74 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 97/52 mmHg (with a normal range of 95/42-115/61 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 4-25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 76.

The patient has received several medications including levofloxacin, cefipime, vancomycin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's laboratory results show the following:
- White blood cell count: 6.8 K/uL (with a normal range of 4.1-11.0 K/uL)
- Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL (with a normal range of 12.0-16.0 g/dL for males)
- Platelet count: 245 K/uL (with a normal range of 150-450 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL (with a normal range of 0.6-1.2 mg/dL)
- Troponin T: 0.03 ng/mL (with a normal range of 0.00-0.20 ng/mL)
- Blood glucose: 155 mg/dL (with a normal range of 70-100 mg/dL)

The patient's microbiology results indicate a gram stain showing extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions, making the bacterial culture results invalid. Another specimen is required for further evaluation.

The patient has a history of pain control, both acute and chronic, and is currently receiving appropriate medication for this.

The patient's impaired physical mobility is due to quadriplegia, which is a condition characterized by paralysis of all four limbs.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever: Source most likely multifocal infiltrates in
   lungs.  Temperature is still elevated not as markedly elevated as
   previously.  Plan to continue current treatment for pneumonia.
   - will cont vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for [**6-6**] day
   course.  Day #1 for antibiotics is [**11-19**].
   - Will need to repeat sputum culture or try BAL for accurate organism
   speciation
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC trend
   # Hypoxia:  Increased O2 requirement associated with fever and
   leukocytosis is concerning for pneumonia.  CXR was read as moderate
   pulmonary edema and interval worsening of his bilateral pleural
   effusions.
   - Respiratory therapy has been able to wean vent settings
   - albuterol MDI
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is erythematous, could be consistent with
   cellulitis versus irritation from staples.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # R common femoral DVT:  Patient
s INR was not bumping appropriately
   with coumadin.  He is now on Lovenox for DVT.
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on
   paxil.  He is unsure about his medication regimen.
   - continue paxil 50mg QD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old man admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has a history of C3-C5 cord contusion, left femur ORIF, and right common femoral DVT. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. His temperature is still elevated, but not as markedly elevated as before. The sputum culture results are inconclusive due to contamination with upper respiratory secretions, so another specimen is needed for accurate organism speciation. The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, which is concerning for pneumonia. His bilateral pleural effusions have worsened, and he has moderate pulmonary edema on CXR. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis. The patient's INR was not bumping appropriately with coumadin, so he is now on Lovenox for DVT. The patient's bipolar disorder medication regimen includes paxil, but he is unsure about his current medication regimen. He will continue on paxil 50mg QD, and other medications will be addressed once he stabilizes. The patient's wound from the L femur ORIF is erythematous, but it is not believed to be the source of infection. Ortho has been consulted for wound evaluation. The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber. The patient has an IVC filter in place for DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-inch tall, 113.9 kg male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and quadriplegia. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a current temperature of 38 degrees Celsius. The patient's blood pressure is low at 89/45 mmHg, and their heart rate is within normal range at 60 bpm. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has been on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 530 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory system is stable with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 61 and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 247 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 126 to 155 mg/dL, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 247 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. Other lab values, including C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T, lactate, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are also within normal limits.

Imaging and microbiology tests have been conducted, with the latest sputum culture showing sparse growth of commensal respiratory flora.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired physical mobility due to quadriplegia.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Quadriplegia causing limitations in movement.
4. Pain control for both acute and chronic pain.
5. Fever of unknown origin (FUO), requiring further investigation.

ICU Care:
1. Nutrition support.
2. Glycemic control.
3. Monitoring and management of lines.
4. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Pain management with analgesics.
6. Full code status.
7. Disposition: ICU care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has a history of recent C3-C5 cord contusion, L femur ORIF, and R common femoral DVT. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including paxil for bipolar disorder. He is experiencing intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain. His vital signs show a fever of 102.0°F (38.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 89/45-111/57 mmHg, heart rate between 58-70 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. The presence of multifocal infiltrates in the lungs seen on imaging raises concern for VAP. Antibiotics have been started empirically.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right common femoral DVT and is receiving prophylaxis with Lovenox and an IVC filter.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care should be implemented to prevent this.
4. Delirium: ICU patients, especially those with multiple comorbidities and medication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of spinal cord contusion, respiratory failure, pain, s/p C3-5 contusion, s/p L femur ORIF, and R common femoral DVT. He has been admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis and elevated temperature. He is currently on minimal ventilator settings and comfortable. The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain but intermittently refuses pain medications. The assessment and plan include continuing antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), weaning pressure support, and monitoring fever curve and WBC trend. The patient's incision site from L femur ORIF is healing well. He is also being managed for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Spinal cord injury complications: The patient has a history of C3-C5 cord contusion, which may lead to further neurological complications such as paralysis or pressure ulcers.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of right common femoral DVT, putting him at risk for clot formation and potential embolization to the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of femur fracture, post-operative ORIF (operative repair), DVT/PE (deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism), and quadriplegia. The patient was admitted with hypoxia and fevers.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Fevers: The patient is still febrile despite antibiotic treatment for multifocal pneumonia. The cause of the fever could be due to cord contusion. The antibiotics should be continued and tailored based on the results of any positive cultures.
2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating weaning from the ventilator and will be switched to CPAP/PSV mode.
3. C3-5 contusion: The patient is wearing a cervical collar.
4. DVT: The patient is on enoxaparin (lovenox).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)
- Bed sores
- Infection due to the quadriplegia
- Respiratory failure
- Pneumonia

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of these complications and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage them."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever.
   # Fever: Source could be [**12-30**] multifocal infiltrates in lungs.  However,
   patient continues to spike on antibiotics; fever likely related to
   spinal cord injury.  Temperature continues to be elevated, but is
   improving.
   - will cont vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin for VAP.  Day #1 for
   antibiotics is [**11-19**], today day [**5-5**]
   - f/u final sputum cx -> (-), contaminated with upper respiratory
   flora; repeated [**11-24**], f/u results
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC trend
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Now on minimal ventilator settings with patient
   comfortable and satting well.  Will continue to wean pressure support
   today with possible re-trial of trach mask today.  Patient falied
   yesterday [**12-30**] anxiety.  Patient was on vent at rehab prior to
   admission.
   - continue abx as above
   - repeat AP portable chest film today
   - PMV this morning
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain, but intermittently refuses pain medications.  Likely
   depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol prn for now; will try to minimize narcotic usage
   (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   - social work consult
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - will contact [**Name (NI) **], as patient stating he has questions about
   prognosis.
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on
   paxil.  He is unsure about his medication regimen.
   - continue paxil 50mg QD
   - will re-address other medications with the patient as he stabilizes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Fever: The patient has had a persistent fever, which could be due to a multifocal infection in the lungs. However, since the fever continues despite antibiotic therapy, it is likely related to the spinal cord injury.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially on mechanical ventilation but is now on minimal ventilator settings. The plan is to continue weaning pressure support and possibly trial a tracheostomy mask today. The patient has a history of respiratory failure prior to admission.

3. Pain management: The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain. There may be a depressive component to the pain as well. Pain medications such as toradol and tramadol are being used, with an attempt to minimize narcotic usage.

4. C3-5 contusion: The patient has a contusion in the C3-5 region of the spinal cord. A cervical spine collar is being used, and the patient is scheduled to follow up with neurosurgery as an outpatient in 6 weeks with a repeat MRI.

5. L femur ORIF: The patient had left femur ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) surgery, and the incision is healing well. Ortho consultation has been done, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with C3 fracture and subsequent quadriplegia now with
   readmission from rehab with recurrent and signfiicant fever.  This is
   in the setting of minimal change in WBC count, no evidence of bandemia
   and no obvious culture results being seen as explanatory at this time.
   This does leave DVT possible in addition to alternative infectious
   sources.
   1)Fever-Quite convincing imaging from CT scan for significant pulmonary
   infection.
   -For VAP=Vanco/Cefepime/Levoflox for 8 day course at minimum based upon
   culture results
   -Will follow up culture results from sputum to refine coverage
   -Flu screen negative
   -Will need to remain vigilant for alteranative sources
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue PSV and wean as tolerate
   -Continue with PMV trials across time limited by secretions
   3)Quadriplegia-
   -PT for support going forward

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of C3 fracture and subsequent quadriplegia. He was readmitted from rehab with recurrent and significant fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV support. The patient is maintaining PSV support and is on multiple medications including antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin) for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24,000 cells/mm³, elevated CRP level of 28.6 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T level of 0.03 ng/mL. Imaging studies reveal diffuse ground glass opacities in all lobes on CT scan, consistent with pneumonia and collapse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Fever: The patient's persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection, possibly VAP. Antibiotics have been initiated, but further evaluation and treatment may be required based on culture results.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient is on PSV support and continues to require respiratory assistance. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to secretions. PMV trials will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has a history of C3-C5 cord contusion, right femur ORIF, and bipolar disorder. The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings, comfortable, and oxygenating well. His temperature is improving but still elevated, indicating possible fever related to spinal cord injury. He has been on antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and blood and urine cultures were sent this morning. The patient's pain is being managed with tramadol, toradol, and lidocaine patch, and social work consult was requested due to possible depressive component to pain. The patient's L femur ORIF incision is healing well, and ortho consult was requested for wound evaluation. He has a history of DVT and is on lovenox and IVC filter prophylaxis. His bipolar disorder medication regimen needs to be discussed with the patient. The patient's current disposition is ICU for now, with plans for screening for return to rehab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate possible VAP. Continued monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent further complications.

   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever.
   # Fever: Source could be [**12-30**] multifocal infiltrates in lungs.  However,
   patient continues to spike on antibiotics; fever possibly related to
   spinal cord injury.  Temperature elevated again this morning after
   several days of only low grade temps.  Today is day [**6-4**] of abx for VAP.
   - will stop vanc today in case that could be source of fevers; will
   stop cefepime/levo tomorrow on day 8
   - send blood and urine Cx this AM, sputum if possible
   - will continue to culture for high grade fevers and would like 48hrs
   neg prior to rehab transfer
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC trend
   - will BAL only if discrete infiltrate seen on CXR
   - if fevers continue after abx stopped with no source, would consider
   CT torso to evaluate for intra-abd source of infection
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Now on minimal ventilator settings with patient
   comfortable and satting well.  Will continue to wean pressure support
   today with possible re-trial of trach mask today.  Patient falied prior
   trials [**12-30**] anxiety.  Patient was on vent at rehab prior to admission.
   - will speak with outpatient psychiatrist and restart [**Month/Day (2) 2509**] psych meds
   to minimize patient
s anxiety
   - continue abx as above
   - PMV as tolerated
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain, but intermittently refuses pain medications.  Likely
   depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   - social work consult
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has been on antibiotics for VAP since day 6, and his fever persists despite the treatment. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and is comfortable on minimal settings. There are concerns about potential sources of infection, including multifocal infiltrates in the lungs, spinal cord injury, and intra-abdominal sources. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently on paxil. He is also recovering from an L femur ORIF and has a history of right common femoral DVT. The patient's pain management is a concern, as he intermittently refuses pain medications. The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and he is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with quadriplegia following MVC triggered by syncope.
   Patient has had some improvement in motor function and now admitted
   with fever, hypoxia and concern for ventilator associated pneumonia.
   He has had continued fevers without over obvious systemic insult being
   seen with source of fevers [**Last Name (un) 760**] possibly central rather than with
   persistent and significant bacterial infection at this time.
   1) FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)-
   -For possible VAP--Vanco/Levoflox/Cefepime for 8 day course (as long as
   GNR not seen dominantly on culture results)
   -Will continue to culture for fever elevation but do not see clear
   evidence that this is primarily systemic insult from infection
   -Will follow cultures for 48 hours prior to return to rehab
   -Will minimize potential offending medications
will move to D/C
   antibiotics as we are now at 48 hours of cultures negative and 7 days
   of antibiotics in place.  What we will do is move to D/C antibiotics
   with course completed and will D/C vanco today
   -Vanco off today
   -BAL if we have an obvious target in regards to infiltrate
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Wil continue with trach mask trials
   -Will continue to reassure and provide ativan prior to trach mask
   trials
   -Will return to complete bipolar disorder regimen
   3)Quadriplegia-
   -Continue with PT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with quadriplegia following a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has had continued fevers without an obvious systemic insult being seen as the source of the fevers. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 105/52 to 65 mmHg, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 338 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 68.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tracheostomy in place, distant heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, dullness to percussion, and rhonchorous breath sounds. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is able to move lower extremities with feet and hands. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 212 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 108 mg/dL, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, impaired physical mobility, quadriplegia, and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefipime, famotidine, enoxaparin, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.2 F, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's weight has increased from admission to the current time. The patient has received fluids and blood products. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests may indicate an infection leading to sepsis. Prompt management and identification of the source of infection are crucial.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk for worsening respiratory failure. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient continues to fail PSV trials secondary
   to tachypnea, likely due to anxiety and poor inspiratory capacity.
   - cont Haldol as per psych consult, check daily EKG
   - will  again attempt to speak with outpatient psychiatrist and restart
   [**Year (4 digits) 2509**] psych meds to minimize patient
s anxiety
   - continue AC for today given testing
   .
   # Fever: Patient continues to spike on broad spectrum antibiotics;
   fever less likely related to spinal cord injury since not central
   injury/head trauma. Pt was afebrile prior to previous discharge, so
   cannot make this diagnosis of exclusion yet. Cannot rule out drug
   fever, and have been tapering antibiotics as possible. VAP course
   completes today, will monitor if D/Cing abx resolves fevers. CXR
   unchanged. Will seek alternative sources of infection today including
   intraabdominal abscess or epidural abscess, or endocarditis.
   - CT A/P with contrast
   -MRI C, T L spine
   - TTE
   - f/u cx
   - will continue to culture for high grade fevers once daily, would like
   48hrs neg prior to rehab transfer
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain, but intermittently refuses pain medications.  Likely
   depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   - social work consult
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on
   paxil.  He is unsure about his medication regimen.
   - continue paxil 50mg QD, Haldol prn
   - contact [**Name (NI) 2509**] psychiatrist and adjust meds as above

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient continues to fail positive pressure ventilation (PSV) trials due to tachypnea, likely caused by anxiety and poor inspiratory capacity. He has been receiving Haldol for anxiety and will continue to be monitored with daily EKG. The patient's fever persists despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and alternative sources of infection are being investigated. The patient also complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, but intermittently refuses pain medications. 

The patient has a history of right common femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. He has a bipolar disorder and is currently on Paxil. The patient's incision from left femur ORIF is healing well, and there are no signs of infection. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.2°F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 213 K/uL and elevated lactate levels. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and will remain there until his infectious workup is complete"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with history of MVC and quadriplegia subsequently with
   persistent ventilatory failure requiring PSV support for ventilation.
   He has had impressive and continued fevers despite antibiotic Rx and
   they remain a relatively solitary finding as hemodynamics are unchanged
   at the time of fever elevations.
   1)Fever
we do not have clear source, we do have 8 days of Rx for
   ventilator associated pneumonia.  We do have concern for drug fever at
   this time.  We have raised concern for alternative source of infection
   which we have yet to identify and will pursue D/C of antibiotics at
   this time and minimize all other offending medications.  Will have to
   follow cultures.
   -Will D/C antibiotics today at 8 days for HAP
   -Will pursue CT of chest/Abdomen
   -Will pursue MRI of spine in area of previous injury to evaluate for
   localized collection
   -TTE to look for possible endocarditis
   -Will pursue ID consultation if fevers persist and source unable to be
   found
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   _Will continue to trial PSV wean
   -Patient OOB to chair today with good effect
   -Will maintain with full support today with A/C and use bolus sedation

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of motor vehicle collision and subsequent quadriplegia, who now requires persistent ventilatory failure requiring pressure support ventilation (PSV) support for ventilation. The patient has been experiencing impressive and continued fevers despite antibiotic treatment, and the source of the fever remains unclear. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia for the past 8 days, and there is concern for drug fever. Alternative sources of infection have not yet been identified, so all medications will be minimized and cultures will be pursued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the PSV support is not properly managed or if the patient develops new complications such as pneumonia or a ventilator-associated event.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The persistent fevers indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Identifying the source of the fever is crucial to guide appropriate treatment and prevent further complications.
3. Drug Fever: The prolonged use of antibiotics may lead to drug fever, which could be contributing to the patient's persistent fevers.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: Due to the patient's quadriplegia and immobility, there is a risk of impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers and infections.
5. Anxiety and Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's anxiety and impaired physical mobility due to quadriple"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's persistent fevers suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to fail PSV trials secondary to tachypnea, likely due to anxiety and poor inspiratory capacity. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are required to maintain adequate respiratory function.
3. Pain management: The patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, and shoulder pain. It is important to address these symptoms to improve patient comfort and reduce anxiety.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO: Pt has been febrile for past 24 hours. Source of fever less
   likely related to spinal cord, but patient may have had substantial
   head trauma which may contribute to central fevers. Pt was afebrile
   prior to previous discharge, so cannot make this diagnosis of exclusion
   yet. Cannot rule out drug fever, and has been off antibiotics for 24
   hours. CT A/P did not reveal any sources. MRI with no gross
   abnormalities but read pending. TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had
   been mildly elevated (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down,
   no focal RUQ pain.
   - hold off abx and unecessary meds
   - ID consult
   - send stool for other infectious sources: O&P, crypto/giardia, cx
   - add Motrin for fevers
   - will continue to culture for high grade fevers once daily, would like
   48hrs neg prior to rehab transfer
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - continue AC with setting for pt comfort
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   - social work consult
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - PT consult
   .
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on
   paxil.  He is unsure about his medication regimen.
   - continue paxil 50mg QD, Haldol prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of recent C3-C5 cord contusion, admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient has been febrile for the past 24 hours, and the source of fever is still unknown. The patient has also experienced respiratory failure, pain, and a history of right common femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as bipolar disorder.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite being off antibiotics for 24 hours. The source of the fever is still unknown and could be due to drug fever, central fever from head trauma, or another underlying infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. This may require continued mechanical ventilation support.

3. Pain Management: The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain. Pain management strategies should be implemented to alleviate these symptoms while minimizing narcotic usage.

4. DVT and IVC Filter: The patient has a history of right common femoral DVT and has undergone inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. Regular monitoring and management of this condition are essential to prevent further complications.

5. Bipolar Disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of motor vehicle collision (MVC) currently experiencing persistent ventilatory failure.
- The patient has ongoing fever of unknown origin, increased metabolic demand, and significant neuromuscular weakness.
- The patient's respiratory failure is chronic and will continue with pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The patient's fever is persistent despite being off antibiotics.
- Recent studies include an echocardiogram without vegetation, a CT abdomen showing no evidence of focal collection, and an MRI of the spine pending.
- Antibiotics will be held at this time, and a follow-up complete blood count with differential is recommended.
- An infectious disease (ID) consult has been made today to aid in further evaluation and treatment.
- ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection, sepsis, or another inflammatory condition. This could progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Neuromuscular Weakness: The significant neuromuscular weakness may increase the risk of bed"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, with Tmax at 103.9.  Still
   unclear source.  Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source
   (though we were treating with broad spectrum abx), abscess.  Central
   source unlikely as this is a spinal cord injury, and there is no known
   insult to the brain.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources. MRI with no
   gross abnormalities but read pending. TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs
   had been mildly elevated (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended
   down, no focal RUQ pain.
   - hold off abx and unecessary meds
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Follow up on urine, blood, stool cultures
   - Follow up HIV
   - Add Motrin for fevers
   - Curbside neuro re: central fevers
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - continue AC with setting for pt comfort
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - PT consult
   .
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Psychiatric history:  Patient has been labeled as having bipolar
   disorder in the past, but psychiatry does not believe this is his true
   diagnosis.  Unclear medication regimen in past.
   - Continue paxil 50mg QD
   - Haldol changed to seroquel for fear of drug fever, but QT is
   prolonged today at 480 and seroquel was stopped.  Will consider
   restarting haldol.
   Barriers to extubation:  Anxiety, muscle weakness.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, with Tmax at 103.9.  Still
   unclear source.  Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source
   (though we were treating with broad spectrum abx), abscess.  Central
   source unlikely as this is a spinal cord injury, and there is no known
   insult to the brain.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources. MRI with no
   gross abnormalities but read pending. TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs
   had been mildly elevated (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended
   down, no focal RUQ pain.
   - hold off abx and unecessary meds
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Follow up on urine, blood, stool cultures
   - Follow up HIV
   - Add Motrin for fevers
   - Curbside neuro re: central fevers
   - will continue to culture for high grade fevers once daily, would like
   48hrs neg prior to rehab transfer
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - continue AC with setting for pt comfort
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - PT consult
   .
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Bipolar disorder:  His medication regimen prior to previous admission
   included paxil, lamictal, xanax, and ritalin.  Currently he is on
   paxil.  He is unsure about his medication regimen.
   - continue paxil 50mg QD, seroquel QHS.

The patient presented with fevers and has a history of long-standing depression, treated with paroxetine and lamotrigine. They have been experiencing clear gel-like secretions from the rectum and have a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support. The patient is currently on multiple medications including famotidine, enoxaparin, lorazepam, and seroquel. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, slightly low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's weight has increased since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1819 mL, output of 1565 mL, and a negative balance of 254 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a respiratory support device. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures, urine culture, and stool studies are pending. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, impaired physical mobility, quadriplegia, pain control, and fever of unknown origin. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient has full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The pending cultures will help identify the causative agent. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is"

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is tolerating pressure support mode (PS) at 5 cm H2O. 

The patient has a history of fever and pulmonary infiltrates, which are attributed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Empirical antimicrobials have been continued for the treatment of VAP. The patient also has persistent fever, which could be a component of infection, such as pneumonia, or a drug-related fever. 

Additionally, the patient underwent inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement due to suspected pulmonary emboli. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and has resolving hematuria, likely due to trauma from the Foley catheter.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently on Paxil and Seroquel. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to chronic respiratory issues and VAP. There is also a risk of developing additional infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections. Given the presence of pulmonary emboli, the patient is at risk for future thromboembolic events. 

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in vital signs, respiratory status"

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 Improved, now on minimal ventilator
   settings.  Pulmonary infiltrates likely account for recent
   decompensation.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to work towards
   trach collar trials as clinical improvement continues.
   PULMONARY INFILATRATES -- attributed to VAP.  Completed empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor off antimicrobials, with low threshold for
   resuming antimicribials and diagnostic bronchoscopy in the event of
   clinical decompensation.
   FEVER -- persistent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of infection (i.e. pneumonia),
   but may also be component of drug-related fever.  Monitor closely.
   Eleiminate non-essential medications.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- s/p IVC filter placement.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure secondary to motor vehicle accident (MVA). He remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is tolerating intermittent positive pressure breaths (IPS mode) at 5 cm H2O. The patient has a fever and pulmonary infiltrates, suggesting possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Empirical antibiotics have been completed, and the patient is being monitored closely for any signs of clinical decompensation. The fever could also be drug-related, so it is important to monitor the patient closely as well.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently on Pail and Seroquel. He has an IVC filter in place due to suspected pulmonary emboli. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. His hematological findings show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), but it is within normal limits. The rest of the lab results are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 94/45 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%, and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

   morning.  Briefly afebrile yesterday.  Still unclear source.
   Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source (though we were
   treating with broad spectrum abx), abscess.  Central source unlikely as
   this is a spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the
   brain.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources. MRI with no gross
   abnormalities but read pending. TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had
   been mildly elevated (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down,
   no focal RUQ pain.  WBC trending down, now mildly leukopenic -> ?

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of spinal cord injury, respiratory failure, and fever. He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient continues to be febrile with a maximum temperature of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit this morning. Possible sources of fever include drug fever, pulmonary source, abscess, or central source. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics but remains febrile. Laboratory results show leukopenia, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has persistent fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. There may be a need for non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy mask trial.

3. Pain management: The patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, shoulder pain, and depressive component to pain. Narcotic usage should be minimized, and alternative pain management strategies should be considered.

4. Spinal cord contusion: The patient has a history of C3-C5 cord contusion. He should continue wearing a cervical spine collar and follow-up with neurosurgery for repeat MRI after 6 weeks.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin. The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been febrile, with temperatures reaching 103.9°F. The source of the fever is unclear, with possibilities including drug fever, pulmonary source (despite being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics), abscess, or central source (although there is no known insult to the brain). Imaging studies such as CT and MRI have not revealed any abnormalities. Further investigations, including urine, blood, and stool cultures, as well as HIV follow-up, are planned.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is expected to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Non-invasive ventilation support will be continued for patient comfort.

3. Pain Management: The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, which may have a depressive component. Pain management strategies, including the use of toradol, tramadol, and lidocaine patch as needed, will be implemented while minimizing narcotic usage.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, with Tmax at 102.9 early this
   morning.  Briefly afebrile yesterday.  Still unclear source.
   Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source (though we were
   treating with broad spectrum abx), abscess.  Central source unlikely as
   this is a spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the
   brain.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources. MRI with no gross
   abnormalities but read pending. TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had
   been mildly elevated (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down,
   no focal RUQ pain.  WBC trending down, now mildly leukopenic -> ?
   viral.
   - cont to hold abx and unecessary meds
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Follow up on urine, blood, stool cultures
   - Follow up HIV, CMV, EBV
   - Add Motrin for fevers
   - Curbside neuro re: central fevers
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - continue AC with setting for pt comfort
   - cont PSV, consider trial of trach mask
   - f/u today
s CXR
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - PT consult
   .
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - ortho has been consulted for wound eval; do not think this is source
   of infection
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Psychiatric history:  Patient has been labeled as having bipolar
   disorder in the past, but psychiatry does not believe this is his true
   diagnosis.  Unclear medication regimen in past.
   - Continue paxil 50mg QD
   - Haldol changed to seroquel for fear of drug fever, but QT is
   prolonged yesterday at 480 and seroquel was stopped.  Will consider
   restarting haldol.
   Barriers to extubation:  Anxiety, muscle weakness.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of C3-C5 cord contusion, admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient continues to be febrile with a temperature of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit. The source of the fever is still unclear, with possibilities including drug fever, pulmonary source, abscess, or viral infection. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics but remains febrile.

The patient has a history of spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the brain. A CT A/P did not reveal any sources of infection, and an MRI showed no gross abnormalities but is pending further evaluation.

The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating a potential resolution of infection or possibly leukopenia. Liver function tests (LFTs) have been mildly elevated in the past and have trended down, with no focal right upper quadrant pain.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as they will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Non-invasive ventilation support is being provided, and a trial of tracheostomy mask is being considered.

The patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, and shoulder pain, which may have a depressive component. Pain management options include toradol, tramadol, and lidocaine patch on an as-needed basis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, hypoxia, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and impaired skin integrity. He also has anxiety, impaired physical mobility, quadriplegia, and acute and chronic pain. The patient's fever of unknown origin (FUO) persists despite antibiotic treatment. The patient is receiving various ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the ventilation strategy if necessary will be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other risk factors increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent stress ulcers.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to pressure ulcers or infections. Regular turning and proper skin care are crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment indicates a possible underlying infection or"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yom chronic respiratory failure s/p MVA, now with fever and
   pulmonary infiltrates.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 Improved, now on minimal ventilator
   settings.  Pulmonary infiltrates likely account for recent
   decompensation.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to work towards
   trach collar trials as clinical improvement continues.
   PULMONARY INFILATRATES -- attributed to VAP.  Completed empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor off antimicrobials, with low threshold for
   resuming antimicribials and diagnostic bronchoscopy in the event of
   clinical decompensation.
   FEVER -- persistent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of infection (i.e. pneumonia),
   but may also be component of drug-related fever.  Unclear whether
   related to spinal cord trauma.  Monitor closely.  Eleiminate
   non-essential medications.
   FLUIDS -- may be hypovolemic, now with insensible losses (fever).  [**Month (only) 8**]
   require iv fluid boluses if urine out put declines.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- right DVT --> s/p IVC filter placement.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG at goal.
   HEMATURIA -- likely trauma from foley.  Clearling/improving.
   Monitor.
   h/o BIPOLAR DISORDER -- Paxil, serequil.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). He remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and is currently on minimal ventilator settings. The patient has developed a fever and pulmonary infiltrates, indicating possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's respiratory failure has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. The plan is to work towards tracheostomy collar trials as clinical improvement continues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The presence of pulmonary infiltrates suggests the possibility of VAP. If left untreated, it can progress to severe lung infection and sepsis.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and subsequent inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. There is a risk of developing new DVTs due to prolonged immobilization and mechanical ventilation.
4. Fever: The patient's persistent fever could be attributed to an ongoing infection or drug-related fever. Monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and prevent complications.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient may be at risk of hypovolemia due to insensible losses from fever and other factors. Close monitoring of urine output is essential to"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yom chronic respiratory failure s/p MVA, now with fever and
   pulmonary infiltrates.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 Improved, now on minimal ventilator
   settings.  Pulmonary infiltrates likely account for recent
   decompensation.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to work towards
   trach collar trials as clinical improvement continues.
   PULMONARY INFILATRATES -- attributed to VAP.  Completed empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor off antimicrobials, with low threshold for
   resuming antimicribials and diagnostic bronchoscopy in the event of
   clinical decompensation.
   FEVER -- persistent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of infection (i.e. pneumonia),
   but may also be component of drug-related fever.  Unclear whether
   related to spinal cord trauma.  Monitor closely.  Eleiminate
   non-essential medications.
   FLUIDS -- may be hypovolemic, now with insensible losses (fever).  [**Month (only) 8**]
   require iv fluid boluses if urine out put declines.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- right DVT --> s/p IVC filter placement.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG at goal.
   HEMATURIA -- likely trauma from foley.  Clearling/improving.
   Monitor.
   h/o BIPOLAR DISORDER -- Paxil, serequil.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident (MVA), currently experiencing fever and pulmonary infiltrates. He remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and has been on minimal ventilator settings. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.4°C (102.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 to 112/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent development of fever and pulmonary infiltrates. 

Physical examination findings include normal general appearance, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, and no signs of distress or discomfort. The cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heart rhythm, no murmurs, and no edema. The respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. The abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender bowel sounds. The extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The platelet count is within normal range. The results of other lab tests, including"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, still unclear source.
   Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source (though we were
   treating with broad spectrum abx), abscess.  Central source unlikely as
   this is a spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the
   brain.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources. MRI with no gross
   abnormalities but read pending. TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had
   been mildly elevated (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down,
   no focal RUQ pain.  WBC trending down, now mildly leukopenic -> ?
   viral.
   - cont to hold abx and unecessary meds
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Follow up on urine, blood, stool cultures
   - Follow up HIV, CMV, EBV
   - Motrin for fevers
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - continue AC with setting for pt comfort
   - cont PSV, consider trial of trach mask
   - f/u today
s CXR
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol and lidocaine patch prn for now; will try to
   minimize narcotic usage (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - PT consult
   .
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Psychiatric history:  Patient has been labeled as having bipolar
   disorder in the past, but psychiatry does not believe this is his true
   diagnosis.
   - Continue paxil 50mg QD
   - consider restarting haldol
   Barriers to extubation:  Anxiety, muscle weakness.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin. The assessment and plan section mentions several potential causes for his fever, including drug fever, pulmonary source, abscess, and central source.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the source of the fever remains unclear. The note also mentions that a CT A/P did not reveal any sources, and an MRI with no gross abnormalities is pending. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no vegetations, and liver function tests (LFTs) have trended down, suggesting a possible viral infection.

In addition to the fever, the patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. The note suggests continuing assisted control ventilation (AC) with settings for patient comfort and considering a trial of tracheostomy mask.

The patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, and shoulder pain, which are likely related to the C3-C5 contusion. The pain management plan includes toradol, tramadol, and lidocaine patch as needed, with an effort to minimize narcotic usage.

The patient has a history of left femur ORIF, right common femoral DVT, and psychiatric history including"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion, admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin. Possible sources include drug fever, pulmonary source, or central source. Imaging studies such as CT and MRI have shown no abnormalities. The patient also has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently on paxil.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to muscle weakness and poor inspiratory effort. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support may be required.
3. Pain Management: The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain. Pain management strategies, including non-narcotic medications like Motrin and tramadol, should be implemented while minimizing narcotic usage.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right common femoral DVT and is currently receiving prophylactic enoxaparin (Lovenox). Regular monitoring of the lower extremities for signs of swelling or discoloration is essential.
5. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Care: The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. This includes ongoing assessment of vital"

   trach collar trials as clinical improvement continues.
   PULMONARY INFILATRATES -- attributed to VAP.  Completed empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor off antimicrobials, with low threshold for
   resuming antimicribials and diagnostic bronchoscopy in the event of
   clinical decompensation.
   FEVER -- persistent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of infection (i.e. pneumonia),
   but may also be component of drug-related fever.  Unclear whether
   related to spinal cord trauma.  Monitor closely.  Eleiminate
   non-essential medications.
   SPINAL CORD INJURY -- etiology of quadraplegia.  WIll require
   rehabilitation.
   FLUIDS -- may be hypovolemic, now with insensible losses (fever).  [**Month (only) 8**]
   require iv fluid boluses if urine out put declines.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- right DVT --> s/p IVC filter placement.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). The patient is currently experiencing fever and pulmonary infiltrates, which are likely contributing to his recent decompensation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and the plan is to continue with minimal ventilator settings while working towards tracheostomy trials as clinical improvement continues.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary infiltrates attributed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Empirical antimicrobials have been completed, and the plan is to monitor the patient closely for any signs of clinical decompensation. If necessary, antimicrobials may be resumed and diagnostic bronchoscopy may be performed.

The patient also has a persistent fever, which may be due to an infection or drug-related causes. The etiology of the patient's quadriplegia is related to spinal cord injury. The patient may be hypovolemic and require intravenous fluid boluses if urine output declines.

Additionally, the patient has a history of right deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has undergone inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement to prevent pulmonary embolism. The patient requires nutritional support through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube feeds at goal.

The patient's hematuria is likely due to trauma from the Foley catheter. It is being monitored and expected to improve.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yom chronic respiratory failure s/p MVA, now with fever and
   pulmonary infiltrates.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 Improved, now on minimal ventilator
   settings.  Pulmonary infiltrates likely account for recent
   decompensation.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Hope to work towards
   trach collar trials as clinical improvement continues.
   PULMONARY INFILATRATES -- attributed to VAP.  Completed empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor off antimicrobials, with low threshold for
   resuming antimicribials and diagnostic bronchoscopy in the event of
   clinical decompensation.
   FEVER -- persistent.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of infection (i.e. pneumonia),
   but may also be component of drug-related fever.  Unclear whether
   related to spinal cord trauma.  Monitor closely.  Eleiminate
   non-essential medications.
   SPINAL CORD INJURY -- etiology of quadraplegia.  WIll require
   rehabilitation.
   FLUIDS -- may be hypovolemic, now with insensible losses (fever).  [**Month (only) 8**]
   require iv fluid boluses if urine out put declines.
   PULMONARY EMBOLI -- right DVT --> s/p IVC filter placement.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG at goal.
   HEMATURIA -- likely trauma from foley.  Clearling/improving.
   Monitor.
   h/o BIPOLAR DISORDER -- Paxil, serequil.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, and recent decompensation is attributed to pulmonary infiltrates likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to work towards tracheostomy trials as clinical improvement continues.

The patient also has a history of spinal cord injury, resulting in quadriplegia. Rehabilitation will be required for this condition. Additionally, the patient may be hypovolemic due to insensible losses from fever, and intravenous fluid boluses may be necessary if urine output declines.

The patient has an IVC filter in place after being diagnosed with a right deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Nutritional support is provided through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube at goal.

There is also a mention of hematuria, which is likely due to trauma from a Foley catheter. This condition is improving and being monitored.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is taking medications such as Pail and Seroquel.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is set to full code, and the patient is currently admitted to the ICU."

   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, still unclear source.
   Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source (though we were
   treating with broad spectrum abx).  Central source unlikely as this is
   a spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the brain,
   corroborated by neurosurg.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources on [**11-26**].
   MRI spine (-). TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had been mildly elevated
   (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down, no focal RUQ pain.
   WBC trending down, now mildly leukopenic -> ? viral.  Multiple viral
   studies pending

The patient is receiving tube feeds and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Possible sources include drug fever, pulmonary infection, or a central source, although the latter seems unlikely in this case. Further evaluation is needed, including viral studies and cultures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Non-invasive ventilation support should be continued, and an AM CXR should be done.
3. Pain Management: The patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, and shoulder pain, possibly with a depressive component. Pain management should involve minimizing narcotic usage and considering alternative options like toradol and tramadol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing persistent fever, upper abdominal pain, and upper back pain. The patient is also reported to have blurry vision, but this symptom has not been further evaluated.

The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated temperature (104.5 C) and slightly low blood pressure (105/59 mmHg). The heart rate is within normal range (83 bpm), respiratory rate is slightly elevated (22 insp/min), and oxygen saturation is good (97%). The patient's weight has increased from 109.3 kg at admission to 135 kg currently.

The patient is receiving various medications including enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, hydromorphone for pain management, and lorazepam for anxiety. The patient is also on tube feeds for nutritional support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 3.9-7.3 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) with a range of 26.7-29.4 %, and normal platelet count (Plt) within the range of 212-249 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, still unclear source.
   Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source (though we were
   treating with broad spectrum abx).  Central source unlikely as this is
   a spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the brain,
   corroborated by neurosurg.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources on [**11-26**].
   MRI spine (-). TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had been mildly elevated
   (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down, no focal RUQ pain.
   WBC trending down, now mildly leukopenic -> ? viral.  Multiple viral
   studies pending
   - cont to hold abx and unecessary meds
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Follow up on urine, blood, stool cultures
   - Follow up HIV, CMV, EBV
   - Motrin for fevers
   - consider repeat CT abdomen, as pt newly symptomatic with epigastric
   abd. pain
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - cont PSV
   - AM CXR
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.
   - toradol, tramadol prn for now; will try to minimize narcotic usage
   (dilaudid, oxycodone)
   .
   # s/p C3-5 contusion
   - cont [**Location (un) 408**] J c-spine collar
   - to follow-up with neurosurgery as an outpatient 6 weeks after initial
   injury with repeat MRI
   - PT consult
   .
   # s/p L femur ORIF:  Incision is healing well.   Less likely etiology
   of fever.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hx of R common femoral DVT:  Lovenox, IVC filter
   # Psychiatric history:  Patient has been labeled as having bipolar
   disorder in the past, but psychiatry does not believe this is his true
   diagnosis.
   - Continue paxil 50mg QD
   Barriers to extubation:  Anxiety, muscle weakness.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has been febrile and it is unclear about the source of the fever. Possible causes include drug fever, pulmonary source, central source, and viral infection. Further evaluation is needed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support is recommended.

3. Pain: The patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, and shoulder pain. There may be a depressive component to the pain as well. Pain management strategies should be implemented, aiming to minimize narcotic usage.

4. Spinal Cord Injury: The patient has a recent C3-C5 cord contusion. It is advised to continue using the cervical spine collar and follow up with neurosurgery as an outpatient after initial injury with repeat MRI.

5. Incision Healing: The patient underwent left femur ORIF, and the incision is healing well. Monitoring is necessary.

6. History of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right common"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man who was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has a history of spinal cord contusion at C3-C5, recent left femur ORIF, and a right common femoral DVT. The patient has been febrile despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and has an unclear source of fever. Possible causes include drug fever, pulmonary source, or central source. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, but these have trended down. The patient's white blood cell count is now mildly leukopenic. Imaging studies such as CT A/P and TTE have not revealed any sources of infection. The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as he is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea and poor inspiratory effort. He also complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, which may have a depressive component. The patient's psychiatric history includes a label of bipolar disorder, although psychiatry does not believe this is his true diagnosis. He is currently on paxil 50mg QD. The patient's nutrition is replete, and he is receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. His code status is full code, and his disposition is to return to [Hospital1].

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old man with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever.
- He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin, with potential sources including drug fever, pulmonary source, and central source.
- The patient has spinal cord injury and no known insult to the brain, as corroborated by neurosurgery.
- CT A/P did not reveal any sources on 11/26, and an MRI spine is pending.
- TTE showed no vegetations.
- Mildly elevated LFTs (alkphos and LDH) in the past have trended down, with a possibility of viral infection.
- Antibiotics and unnecessary medications are being held, and further follow-up on urine, blood, and stool cultures is needed.
- The patient is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness.
- PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation) is being continued, and an AM CXR is planned.
- The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, which may have a depressive component.
- Narcotic usage (Dilaudid, oxycodone) is being minimized.
- The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, but psychiatry does not believe this to be his true diagnosis.

   51 year-old man with recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea,
   hypoxia, and fever, now with persistent fevers of unknown origin.
   .
   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile, still unclear source.
   Possibilities include: drug fever, pulmonary source (though we were
   treating with broad spectrum abx).  Central source unlikely as this is
   a spinal cord injury, and there is no known insult to the brain,
   corroborated by neurosurg.  CT A/P did not reveal any sources on [**11-26**].
   MRI spine (-). TTE showed no vegetations. LFTs had been mildly elevated
   (alkphos and LDH) in past and have trended down, no focal RUQ pain.
   WBC trending down, now mildly leukopenic -> ? viral.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. The patient continues to be febrile with persistent fevers of unknown origin. Possible sources of infection include drug fever, pulmonary source, and central source, but these have been ruled out or are less likely.

The patient's respiratory status is a concern as he is likely to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Non-invasive ventilation support will be continued.

The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, which may be related to the spinal cord injury. Narcotic usage should be minimized.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder but psychiatry does not believe this is his true diagnosis. He is currently on paxil 50mg QD.

The patient's nutrition is being managed with enteral feeding at 75 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being monitored.

Prophylactic measures include enoxaparin for DVT prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis, although the latter is currently being held due to possible drug fever.

The patient's disposition will be returned to [Hospital1]."

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion, admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin and is suspected to have a fever of unknown origin (FUO). The possible causes of the fever include drug fever or a rheumatological condition.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been experiencing tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness, which suggests that he will likely fail extubation. Therefore, he will continue with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and a valve as tolerated.

The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, which are likely due to a depressive component to pain. He has been prescribed toradol and tramadol as needed for pain relief.

The patient has a history of right common femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has received low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He also has a psychiatric history, which includes being labeled as having bipolar disorder but without confirmation from psychiatry.

The patient's barriers to extubation include anxiety and muscle weakness. His current medications include hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.2°F, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He has a history of C3-C5 cord contusion, right common femoral DVT, and psychiatric history including bipolar disorder diagnosis. The patient continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin, likely not infectious in nature. Possible causes include drug fever or a rheumatological condition. 

The patient's respiratory status is a concern as he will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Pain management is also important, as the patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain, and shoulder pain. 

Other issues include the patient's psychiatric history, for which he is currently on paxil 50mg QD. Additionally, the patient has a history of DVT and an IVC filter in place. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 60-92 mmHg, heart rate between 66-79 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range. 

The patient's care plan includes holding antibiotics and unnecessary medications, considering an outpatient work-up for rheumatological conditions, continuing positive airway pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has been on invasive ventilation for an extended period and continues to require respiratory support.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, which may be due to prolonged immobility, poor nutrition, or other factors.

3. Anxiety: The patient appears to be anxious, which could be related to their current medical condition and hospitalization.

4. Impaired physical mobility: The patient has quadriplegia, indicating severe motor impairment in all four limbs.

5. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient requires pain management for both acute and chronic pain issues.

6. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): The patient's fevers persist without an identified cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the fever.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of these complex medical complications while also addressing their respiratory needs, skin integrity, anxiety, mobility limitations, and pain control."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old man with a recent C3-C5 cord contusion admitted for dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever. He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin, which could be due to a drug fever or less likely a rheumatological condition. 

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is expected to fail extubation due to tachypnea, poor inspiratory effort, and muscle weakness. Non-invasive ventilation and a pressure support ventilation mode have been initiated.

The patient also complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, which are managed with toradol and tramadol as needed. There is a depressive component to the pain as well.

The patient has a history of right common femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has received enoxaparin (Lovenox) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for prophylaxis.

Psychiatric history indicates that the patient has been labeled with bipolar disorder in the past, but psychiatry does not believe this to be his true diagnosis. He is currently taking paxil 50mg once daily.

Barriers to extubation include anxiety and muscle weakness. The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has multiple lines in place for various medications and treatments. Prophylactic measures include enoxaparin for DVT and stress"

   # FUO:  Patient continues to be febrile intermittently, almost
   certainly not infectious.  Possibilities include drug fever or less
   likely rheumatological condition. ID has signed off.
   - cont to hold abx and unecessary meds
   - f/u with ID for outpatient FUO workup
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Will likely fail extubation due to tachypnea
   [**12-30**] poor inspiratory effort and muscle weakness. NIF low.
   - cont PSV and valve as tolerated
   .
   # Pain:  Patient complains of intermittent headache, back pain,
   shoulder pain.  Likely depressive component to pain as well.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever due to a C3-C5 cord contusion.
- He continues to have persistent fevers of unknown origin, which are likely not infectious.
- The patient's respiratory status is worsening, making him likely to fail extubation.
- He complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain.
- The patient has a history of right common femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has received enoxaparin (Lovenox) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
- He has a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder, but this diagnosis is not confirmed.
- The patient's barriers to extubation include anxiety and muscle weakness.
- His nutritional status is replete, and he is being provided with fiber supplementation.
- His glycemic control is stable.
- He has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line placed on 11/27/2138.
- Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided.
- The patient's vital signs are generally stable, with a recent temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), blood pressure of 90/51 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on tracheal mask ventilation.
- His white blood cell count is stable at 4.0 K/uL.
- The plan is to transfer the patient to rehabilitation for physical therapy and occupational therapy. He will need follow-up with neurosurgery and may require a workup for fever if it continues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure if extubation is attempted.
2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers of unknown origin, which could be due to drug fever or a less likely rheumatological condition.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
4. Anxiety and impaired physical mobility: The patient's anxiety and muscle weakness pose barriers to extubation and may contribute to his overall impaired physical mobility.
5. Pain control: The patient complains of intermittent headaches, back pain, and shoulder pain, indicating a need for effective pain management.
6. History of DVT: The patient has a history of right common femoral DVT, putting him at risk for recurrent thrombotic events.
7. Psychiatric history: The patient's psychiatric history, including a possible misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, may contribute to his overall mental health and well-being.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note."
