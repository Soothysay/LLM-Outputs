   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She presented to the ICU for a scheduled hemodialysis session and became unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs. This episode is consistent with previous unresponsive episodes experienced during hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of unresponsive episodes during hemodialysis raises the possibility of a seizure disorder.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has type 1 diabetes, which makes her prone to hypoglycemia.
3. Hypercarbia: As the patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), she may have increased carbon dioxide levels in her blood.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 100s, indicating a possibility of hypotension.
5. Acute cardiac event: Considering the patient's age and medical history, there is a possibility of an acute cardiac event.
6. Acute pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of breast cancer and immobilization during hemodialysis, PE is also a potential complication.
7. Pancreatitis: The elevated lipase levels suggest the possibility of pancreatitis.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could be due to disse"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. The patient experienced an unresponsive episode for 8 minutes during hemodialysis with normal vital signs. The possible causes for this episode include seizure disorder, hypoglycemia, hypercarbia, hypotension, acute cardiac event, or acute pulmonary embolism (PE). A CT head was negative, and an EKG showed no acute changes.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:
1. Unresponsiveness/Altered Mental Status: The patient should be monitored closely for any further episodes. Telemetry monitoring and frequent neuro checks are recommended. Blood cultures should be obtained, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) for PE may be considered if possible.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has largely resolved, but there are still some concerns regarding the improvement. Liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase should be trended. The patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for bowel rest. A right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) with LFT abnormalities should be done.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level was high today, indicating hypothyroidism. Free T4 has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on HD (hemodialysis) three times a week, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was found unresponsive during hemodialysis with normal vital signs. The patient's oxygen was turned off, and she had her head back with rolling eyes. This is the second time this has occurred during hemodialysis, which is inconsistent with hypotension. 

The patient has several allergies, including heparin agents, causing hives, and Coumadin (warfarin sodium), causing confusion, delirium, and nausea/vomiting. The last dose of antibiotics given was clindamycin on 08/10/2109 at 02:18 AM.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including prednisone, albuterol, amiodarone, insulin, vitamin D, synthroid, Renagel, and ranitidine.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.6 degrees Celsius (97.8 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 94 beats per minute with a range of 77-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/13 mmHg to 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 12"

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing an episode of unresponsiveness. This could be due to a cardiac arrhythmia or other cardiac complications.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has pulmonary sarcoidosis and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Renal Complications: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She presented with altered mental status for 8 minutes during a hemodialysis session, which is a recurring issue. Other potential causes include hypotension, hypercalcemia, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's mental status remains unchanged despite resolution of hypercalcemia and uremia. Neurological workup and monitoring are recommended. The patient also has a history of unresponsive episodes at home, taking about a week to recover.

Other findings include a positive guaiac stool test indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and abdominal pain. An upper gastrointestinal bleed is suspected, and further evaluation is required. The patient's Synthroid dose was increased due to suspected hypothyroidism.

The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia with various potential causes, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia. Hemolysis labs are negative, and platelet monitoring is ongoing.

The patient's other medical conditions include end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension"

   and the patient took 1 week to recover.  Etiology still unclear, most
   likely hypotension vs. hypercalcemia vs. GI bleed vs. hypothyroid (or a
   result of all of these contributing factors.  Could also consider
   seizure disorder, hypoglycemia, hypercarbia.  Unlikely acute cardiac
   event, acute PE.  CT head negative.  EKG with no acute changes, CE

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She presented to the ICU with altered mental status, which occurred during an HD session and was unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs. She has a history of unresponsive episodes during HD, which may be related to fluid shifts. The etiology of the altered mental status is unclear, with possible contributing factors such as hypotension, hypercalcemia, GI bleed, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder, hypoglycemia, or hypercarbia. CT head was negative, EKG showed no acute changes, and CE was negative. She was given haloperidol with good effect.

She has several other medical issues, including GI bleed (guaifenesin-positive stool), hypercalcemia (elevated calcium level), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), ESRD requiring scheduled HD, type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, and obstructive sleep apnea. She is on multiple medications, including prednisone, amiodarone, anastrozole, and Bipap while sleeping.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's history of unresponsive episodes during HD and the current episode of altered mental status require"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with pulmonary sarcoidosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and admitted with confusion. The patient's confusion is likely due to a combination of factors including dialysis disequilibrium, acute blood loss anemia from a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hypercalcemia, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 100/67 to 119/70 mmHg. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and has a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, Coumadin (warfarin sodium), Percocet (oxycodone HCl/acetaminophen), and an unknown allergy to anesthesia tray medications. The patient was last given antibiotics, specifically clindamycin, on August 10th at 2:18 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.8 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) of 22.8%, low platelet count (Plt) of 39 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 4.0 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T level of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was unresponsive for 8 minutes during a hemodialysis session, but her vital signs remained normal. This episode is likely due to fluid shifts during HD, and previous similar episodes have been observed. The etiology is still unclear, but possible contributing factors include hypotension, hypercalcemia, GI bleed, or hypothyroidism. Neuro consultation indicates a likely toxic metabolic etiology.

The patient's mental status improved today from unresponsive yesterday. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/50-123/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on nasal cannula. She is on mechanical ventilation support.

Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels. Other lab abnormalities include hypercalcemia, elevated lactic acid, low albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. She also has an elevated D-dimer level.

The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, but she has a history of unresponsive episodes during hemodialysis sessions. Her diabetes mellitus type 1 is being managed with insulin, and her atrial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was unresponsive for 8 minutes during a scheduled HD session but had normal vital signs. She has a history of unresponsive episodes during HD that resolve over time. The etiology of these episodes is unclear, but possible contributing factors include hypotension, hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal bleed, and hypothyroidism. Other potential causes such as seizure disorder, hypoglycemia, hypercarbia, and acute cardiac or pulmonary embolism events have been ruled out based on negative CT head, EKG, and Cerebral Edema evaluations.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness during HD, which may be related to fluid shifts during the procedure. It is important to monitor her neurologic status closely and consider the possibility of hypotension, hypercalcemia, GI bleed, or hypothyroidism as potential etiologies. A random morning cortisol level was normal, but diurnal variation may indicate an abnormality. Stress dose steroids could be considered if there is no improvement. Lumbar puncture (LP) is risky due to the patient's low platelet count.

   60 y.o. F with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, breast cancer, and pulmonary
   sarcoidosis who was at scheduled hemodialysis session when she was
   noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Occurred for 8 minute duration at HD with
   normal VS.  Pt has history of unresponsive episodes that are likely to
   to fluid shifs during HD. Per daughter this has happened once before
   and the patient took 1 week to recover.  Etiology still unclear, most
   likely hypotension vs. hypercalcemia vs. GI bleed vs. hypothyroid (or a
   result of all of these contributing factors.  Could also consider
   seizure disorder, hypoglycemia, hypercarbia.  Unlikely acute cardiac
   event, acute PE.  CT head negative.  EKG with no acute changes, CE
   negative.  Awake and agitated overnight. Given 1.5 mg of haldol with
   good result.
   - HD yesterday, hypercalcemia better but not resolved, uremia
   resolved.  MS not improved today.
   - q 2 hour neuro checks
   - random morning cortisol was normal but diurnal variation may indicate
   abnormality.  Pt on chronic steroids
   - chronic prednisone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim is not useful, could consider stress
   dose steroids to see if she responds.
   - if no improvement, and no clear etiology, would consider LP, but
   given PLT count, risky.
   - trend ABG today
   # GI Bleed: Guaiac positive stool yesterday, HCT drop, bumped
   appropriately overnight.  Given abdominal pain, could be ulcer vs.
   divertic.  GI following.
   - IV PPI
   - NPO, bowel rest
   -guaiac all stools

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was admitted to the ICU for hemodialysis when she experienced an unresponsive episode lasting 8 minutes with normal vital signs. The patient has a history of similar unresponsive episodes during hemodialysis, which are believed to be caused by fluid shifts.

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage renal disease. 

For altered mental status, the patient is being closely monitored with neuro checks every 2 hours. A random morning cortisol level was normal, but diurnal variation may indicate abnormality. The patient is also on chronic steroids, and stress dose steroids are being considered.

For gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient has guaiac positive stool, a dropped hemoglobin level, and abdominal pain. This could be due to an ulcer or diverticulitis. The patient is on bowel rest, receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and is being monitored for any further bleeding. A gastrointestinal consultation is planned.

Regarding abdominal pain, the patient has chronically elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and a recent right upper quadrant ultrasound did not show any acute pathology. The patient's LFTs, amylase, and lipase levels are being trended."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), pulmonary sarcoidosis, atrial fibrillation (afib), breast cancer (breast CA), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on BiPAP. She was admitted with minimal responsiveness, now improved but still not back to baseline.

24-hour events:
- The patient's condition improved overnight.
- EKG at 12:00 AM showed MS changes.
- The patient is on several medications including prednisone, levothyroxine, amiodarone, and PPI.
- A GI consult recommended continued PPI but was too high risk for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) due to marginal blood sugar levels and difficulties with blood pressure measurements.
- Neurological assessment suggested toxic metabolic origin of MS changes, and an EEG was ordered. MRI was not done due to concerns about the patient's ability to tolerate the procedure safely.
- The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and Coumadin (warfarin sodium), confusion/delirium with Percocet (oxycodone HCl/acetaminophen), and nausea/vomiting with anesthesia tray (miscellaneous).
- The last dose of antibiotics was Clindamycin on 08/10/2109 at 02:18 AM.
- The patient is currently on various ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of MS changes.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate (HR) of 79 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 105/50 mmHg to 123/72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% on BiPAP.
- The patient is on respiratory support with nasal cannula and oxygen delivery.
- Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight/obese patient with normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.
- Labs show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, low potassium, high sodium, and elevated white blood cell count.
- Radiology images are not available in the provided progress note.

Assessment and Plan:
1. MS changes: The patient's confusion is improving, though she still responds with nonsensical answers at times. Monitoring of MS will continue, and recommendations from consult teams are appreciated. Potential toxic metabolic causes such as hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, and recent low blood pressure in the setting of anemia/blood loss should be evaluated. An echo has been ordered but not yet done, and an MRI was not performed yesterday due to safety concerns with the patient's level"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs during a scheduled HD session. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to fluid shifts during HD, with possible contributing factors including hypotension, hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal bleed, or hypothyroidism. Hypotension in the setting of a GI bleed is the most likely etiology. 

The patient's other medical issues include abdominal pain, which has resolved, GI bleed, hypothyroidism, thrombocytopenia, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type 1, hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and femoral neck fracture (FEN).

The plan includes closely monitoring the patient's mental status, improving medication management for chronic conditions, and addressing specific concerns such as GI bleed, hypercalcemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient will continue with scheduled HD sessions and follow-up with her primary doctor at [Hospital1]."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was unresponsive for 8 minutes during a scheduled hemodialysis session, but her vital signs remained normal. This episode was likely due to fluid shifts during HD. The patient has a history of similar unresponsive episodes in the past. Neurological consultation indicated that the episode was likely toxic metabolic in nature.

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal bleed, hypothyroidism, thrombocytopenia, and end-stage renal disease. The hypercalcemia has improved but not resolved, while uremia has been resolved. The patient's mental status improved today. Neuro checks are being done every 2 hours, and a stress dose of steroids is being considered if there is no improvement. An EEG is recommended, but other imaging may be deferred. Hypothyroidism is another possibility, and the patient's Synthroid dose has been increased.

The patient's abdominal pain and melena have resolved, and her Hct is stable after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells. The decision to perform a gastrointestinal scope has been deferred due to the improved melena and stable Hct.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, and vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia is a possibility. A peripheral smear and CBC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of heart disease (HD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented to the ICU after an episode of unresponsiveness post-dialysis. The patient experienced transient hypotension and is now showing improvement in mental status. She has multiple medical conditions including anemia due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, and is also on a fenfluramine diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental Status Change: The patient initially experienced a transient mental status change, which is improving but the underlying cause is unclear. It could be related to hypotension during hemodialysis or GI bleeding. Further evaluation, including an MRI/MRA, is recommended.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved and is likely secondary to the resolved GI bleed. Close monitoring will be necessary to prevent any future episodes.
3. Anemia (GI bleed): The patient has anemia due to the GI bleed, and ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels and blood counts is essential. Blood transfusions may be required if the anemia becomes severe.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which needs to be managed with appropriate medication.
5. Sarcoidosis: The patient's sarcoidosis is stable, and she should continue taking prednisone as prescribed.
6. FEN (fenfluramine): The patient is on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She presented to the ICU for a scheduled hemodialysis session and was noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs. Her current condition is stable, but she has experienced several medical complications during her stay, including altered mental status, GI bleed, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, thrombocytopenia, ESRD, abdominal pain, hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, sarcoidosis, breast cancer, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of unresponsive episodes during hemodialysis, which may be due to fluid shifts. Close monitoring is required.
2. GI Bleed: The patient had abdominal pain and melena, but these symptoms have improved, and her Hct level is now stable. Further evaluation by GI specialists is recommended.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's T4 levels are normal, while T3 levels are mildly decreased. Synthroid has been increased to 50 mcg.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient had elevated calcium levels, but they are improving. Continuous monitoring is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Mental status change
 improved; could not fit in the MRI machine
   but at this point may not be necessary given her clinical improvement.
   Can discuss with neurology and have followed up on the medical [**Hospital1 **].
   2) Valvular Dysfunction vs. endocarditis vs sarcoid-related valvular
   problem: Cardiology consult
   3) ESRD: hemodialysis today
   4) Thrombocytopenia:
   5) Sarcoidosis:
   Addendum: Cardiology states ECHO findings not consistent with valvular
   problems seen with sarcoid as patient does not have restrictive
   physiology.  Clinically does not necessarily fit with endocarditis but
   cannot rule out particularly given ESRD and chronic prednisone.  They
   would like several more culture sets prior to any decision for
   antibiotics.  Thus, at this time, we will obtain several more sets of
   cultures and then plan to begin antibiotics as I think that given
   ESRD/prednisone usage, it is hard to discern whether these findings
   represent sub-acute endocarditis or not.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, chronic prednisone use, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU for mental status changes and suspected endocarditis. The patient's mental status has continued to improve. Overnight, an echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilation and density on the tricuspid valve, which may suggest vegetations or a dysfunctional valve. The patient has been on hemodialysis due to ESRD. The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 56K/uL. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics while waiting for further culture results. The cardiology team believes that the echocardiogram findings are not consistent with valvular problems typically seen in sarcoidosis and cannot rule out endocarditis, especially given the patient's ESRD and chronic prednisone use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's echocardiogram findings raise suspicion for endocarditis, particularly given her ESRD and chronic prednisone use. This condition can lead to serious complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, and systemic infection.
2. Valvular Dysfunction: The patient's right ventricular dilation and density on the tricuspid valve may indicate valvular dysfunction. This can result in compromised blood flow, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with ongoing evaluation and management in the ICU. The patient has shown improvement in mental status and is currently on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are concerns regarding valvular dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and possible sarcoidosis. The patient has allergies to heparin agents, Coumadin (warfarin sodium), Percocet (oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen), and anesthesia tray (unknown). The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3 C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 125/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent findings. The patient's blood cultures were drawn overnight. The physical examination revealed atrial fibrillation and no other notable findings. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, while other values are within normal range. The patient's most recent chest X-ray is included. The plan includes continuing hemodialysis, further evaluation of valvular dysfunction, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Valvular Dysfunction: The presence of density on the tricuspid valves suggests possible valvular dysfunction, which may lead to complications such as infective endocarditis or heart failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia. This condition can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Sarcoidosis: The patient's history and lab results suggest a possible diagnosis of sarcoidosis. This autoimmune disease can affect multiple organ systems and lead to various complications.
4. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. Chronic kidney disease can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased susceptibility to infections.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can result in an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and recent blood cultures indicate a possible infection. Infections in the ICU can be serious and may require aggressive treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y.o. F with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, breast cancer, and pulmonary
   sarcoidosis who was at scheduled hemodialysis session when she was
   noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Pt has history of unresponsive episodes that
   are likely to to fluid shifs during HD. Per daughter this has happened
   once before and the patient took 1 week to recover.  Likely due to
   hypotension in setting of HD and GI bleed. Per patient
s daughters she
   is now at baseline.

   -GI indicated that probably would not scope given improved melena and
   stable HCT post transfusion
   # ? Vegetation vs. Ruptured chordae on echo: given sarcoidosis and HD,
   patient at increased risk of valvular disease. Per echo fellow, no
   benefit to doing TEE because valve was so well visualized on TTE. Blood
   cultures were send and will follow. Also [**8-9**] culture from ED pending.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. She was noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes during a hemodialysis session, but her vital signs remained normal. The patient has a history of similar unresponsive episodes that are likely due to fluid shifts during hemodialysis. These episodes resolve spontaneously and usually take about a week to recover. 

The patient also had abdominal pain and melena, which have since improved. Her hemoglobin level has stabilized, and no further intervention for the gastrointestinal bleed is planned at this time. Blood cultures were sent due to a suspected possible vegetation or ruptured chordae on echo. The patient has an increased risk of valvular disease due to her sarcoidosis and hemodialysis. 

The patient's thyroid hormone levels were adjusted for hypothyroidism, and her calcium level is improving, likely due to hemodialysis and sarcoidosis. There is a trend of increasing platelet count, making disseminated intravascular coagulation less likely. 

The patient's end-stage renal disease requires scheduled hemodialysis sessions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. She is being monitored for altered mental status episodes during hemodialysis. 

Other ongoing medical issues include type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, asthma, atrial fibrillation, sarcoidosis, breast cancer, obstructive sleep ap"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y.o. F with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, breast cancer, and pulmonary
   sarcoidosis who was at scheduled hemodialysis session when she was
   noted to become unresponsive for 8 minutes with normal vital signs.
   # Altered Mental Status:  Pt has history of unresponsive episodes that
   are likely to to fluid shifs during HD. Per daughter this has happened
   once before and the patient took 1 week to recover.  Etiology still
   unclear, most likely hypotension vs. hypercalcemia vs. GI bleed vs.
   hypothyroid (or a result of all of these contributing factors.   Most
   likely etiology given occurrence during HD is hypotension In setting of
   GI bleed.
   - Will closely monitor MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4941**].  MS improved today.
   - chronic prednisone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim is not useful, could consider stress
   dose steroids to see if she responds.
   - Neuro recommends EEG and MRI -> Would defer MRI or other imaging
   (other than EEG) given improvement today and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] MS.
   # GI Bleed: Abd pain improved, melena resolved.  Hct to 33 and stable
   afte 2 U PRBC.  GI following.
   - check hct qday since stable
   - IV PPI
   -GI indicated that probably would not scope given improved melena and
   stable HCT post transfusion
   # Hypothyroisim: Synthroid increased to 50 (from 25).  T4 Nl.  T3
   mildly decreased.
   # Hypercalcemia: yesterday ca of 10.5, with alb corrects to >11.0.
   Improving.
   -continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt trend up today to 87. DIC much less likely
   given nl fibrinogen, minimal schisto on smear, and gradual decline. ?
   vancomcyin induced thrombocytopenia from previous notes.
   -follow CBC
   - transfuse for plt >50 given ? of GI bleed.
   .
   # ESRD: Scheduled HD on T/Th/Sat.  Followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 208**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2759**] at
   [**Hospital1 54**].
   - continue sevelamer
   - monitor lytes and Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #Abdominal Pain:  Resolved today.
   - trend LFTs, amylase, lipase

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis.
- She was unresponsive for 8 minutes during a hemodialysis session, but her vital signs remained normal. This is the second episode of unresponsiveness, with the first one occurring a week ago.
- The possible etiologies for the altered mental status include hypotension, hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hypothyroidism. Hypotension during hemodialysis is the most likely cause.
- The patient has improved today and an EEG was recommended, but other imaging may be deferred.
- The patient had an abdominal pain episode that has resolved, and she also experienced melena, which has improved. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin level is now stable.
- The patient's thyroid medication was increased due to suspected hypothyroidism, and her T4 levels are normal while T3 is mildly decreased.
- The patient's calcium levels were elevated yesterday, but are improving. Monitoring will continue.
- The patient's platelet count has trended upward, making disseminated intravascular coagulation less likely. Vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia may be a possibility.
- The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
- Other medical issues include asthma,"
