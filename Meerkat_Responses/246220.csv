","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to persistent dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory distress, and her ABG showed acidosis, likely long-standing hypercapnia. She received additional IV lasix with good output and her central venous pressures (CE's) began trending down. However, she became even more tachypneic and increased her work of breathing around 9:30 pm. The patient was able to tolerate BiPAP after finding the right fitting mask with dosing of morphine PRN.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and increased work of breathing indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support with BiPAP or mechanical ventilation may be required.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes suggest possible cardiac involvement. It is important to closely monitor her cardiac status and consider further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram to assess for any underlying cardiac conditions like acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary edema.
3. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and the administration of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Frequent assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging studies may be necessary to identify the source of infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, on home oxygen, who presented with persistent dyspnea. Upon admission, she was tachypneic and anxious. Her vital signs included a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 102/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient was placed on BiPAP and received additional Lasix, which resulted in good output and trending down central venous pressures (CE's).

At around 9:30 pm, the patient became even more tachypneic with increased work of breathing. A new EKG was obtained, and the patient reported feeling unwell, denying chest pain, but experiencing mild nausea and shakiness. Zofran IV was administered.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including dyspnea with a differential diagnosis of COPD exacerbation, flash pulmonary edema, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, and pulmonary embolism. The most likely trigger for her dyspnea is a COPD exacerbation possibly complicated by pneumonia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes IV solumedrol, frequent albuterol/iptropium nebs, BiPAP as tolerated, trial of IV Lasix, nitroglycerin infusion, and an echocardiogram follow-up. The patient is also on morphine for chronic pain and air hunger, ASA for ischemia, and restarting home nifedipine with consideration of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker for rate control. The patient is also being considered for Plavix and heparin IV gtt if cardiac enzymes continue to rise, and Vanc/Zosyn to cover for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. A chest CT angiogram has been held pending response to the above treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and current symptoms suggest a possible COPD exacerbation. This can lead to increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and a higher risk of respiratory failure.

2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms and the presence of cephalization on chest X-ray raise the possibility of flash pulmonary edema. This condition can occur due to acute left ventricular failure and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation may also indicate pneumonia, which can be a complication of COPD exacerbations. Pneumonia can worsen respiratory symptoms and increase the risk of systemic complications such as sepsis.

4. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes may suggest acute coronary syndrome. This condition can lead to decreased cardiac output and contribute to the patient's dyspnea and overall clinical stability.

5. Pulmonary Embolism: Although"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's current condition shows acidosis, likely due to long-standing hypercapnia, as indicated by the ABG results. The patient received additional 10mg of IV lasix, which resulted in good output and decreasing central venous pressures (CE's). However, the patient became even more tachypneic, indicating worsening respiratory distress. BiPap was initiated, and the patient tolerated it after finding the right fitting mask. The patient also received morphine PRN for nausea and shakiness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening shortness of breath, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing suggest a potential respiratory failure. This is further supported by the ABG results indicating acidosis, likely due to hypercapnia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued support with BiPap or mechanical ventilation may be necessary.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes and complaints of not feeling well could indicate potential cardiac complications. Further evaluation, such as cardiac enzymes, is recommended to rule out myocardial infarction or other cardiac issues.

3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a possible infection. Cultures and appropriate antibiotics"

She has a documented do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient experienced continued respiratory distress overnight and became more tachypneic. She was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), but then became hypoxemic.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/52 mmHg to 156/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total input of 394 mL and total output of 1350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 956 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a BiPAP mask, set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted with a flare-up and troponin leak. She has a documented DNR/DNI status. Overnight, she experienced continued respiratory distress and increased tachypnea. She has been on bipap but becomes hypoxemic when it is removed. The patient complained of not feeling well, denying chest pain, and experiencing mild nausea and shakiness. She was given 4 mg of zofran IV. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/52 to 156/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 394 mL and output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 956 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with bipap and has a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 99%. The arterial blood gas values indicate pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 77 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178, and HCO3- of 34 mEq/L. Physical examination reveals general anxiety and distress, crackles in the bibasilar region of the chest, and diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive and following simple commands. Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 18.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, platelet count of 237 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-T levels ranging from 0.26 to 0.41 ng/mL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation.
2. Cardiac ischemia indicated by troponin leak, which may be caused by demand ischemia.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure.
4. Hypoxemia when bipap is removed.
5. Negative fluid balance, indicating potential dehydration or fluid loss.
6. Potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged respiratory support.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
8. Stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
9. Potential worsening of COPD symptoms and respiratory distress."

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided note. However, the 24-hour events mention an echocardiogram showing suboptimal image quality with findings of right ventricular cavity size being normal, focal apical hypokinesis, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, abnormal interventricular septal motion, and mild aortic valve stenosis. The patient also experienced shortness of breath overnight, which resolved after turning off lasix and giving morphine. The patient was hypotensive in the early morning, so lasix was stopped.

Allergies are not reported. The patient has received antibiotics in the past, including levofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including furosemide (lasix) at 2 mg/hour, as well as receiving pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and other medications. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 139/55 mmHg to 78/38 mmHg. The heart rate is within normal range, mostly around 84 bpm. Respiratory rate is generally between 12-13 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains above 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an elderly woman with a history of COPD and recent COPD flare, who was transferred from another hospital with persistent dyspnea.
- The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, and poor air entry.
- Vital signs show hypertension, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation.
- The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, mild aortic valve stenosis, and low normal global left ventricular systolic function.
- The patient experienced hallucinations and nausea after receiving morphine, so it was discontinued.
- The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to recent prednisone use or underlying infection.
- The patient's hypercalcemia has resolved, but electrolyte imbalances are still present.
- The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating dehydration.
- The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation support and has a tracheostomy tube in place.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status.
- The patient's family has been informed about her care plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as persistent dyspnea and wheezing, along with the presence of leukocytosis, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly lady with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU with persistent dyspnea. She has been experiencing hallucinations and nausea after receiving morphine, so it has been discontinued. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been hypertensive in the morning rounds. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 60%. The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds with wheezes throughout, and poor distal pulses. The laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.1 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and hypercalcemia. The patient's imaging shows worsening right lower lobe opacity. The plan includes changing Solumedrol to Prednisone, frequent alb/ipratrop nebs, and holding Lasix due to hypotension. The patient's condition is improving, but potential complications may arise from her underlying conditions such as COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and recent flare-up indicates a risk for further exacerbations. This can lead to increased dyspnea, respiratory distress, and potential respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of worsening right lower lobe opacity on imaging suggests a possible underlying pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, systemic infection, and sepsis.
3. Hypertension: The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with severe COPD exacerbation and respiratory failure. She is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 68/38 mmHg to 149/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and cool extremities. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 18.1, hematocrit of 34.7, platelet count of 237, creatinine of 1.1, troponin-T levels of 0.41, blood glucose levels ranging from 124 to 148 mg/dL, and an elevated INR of 12.5.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia (PNA): Although the patient is showing signs of improvement, there is still a risk of developing pneumonia due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU due to persistent dyspnea. She is currently tolerating a Venturi mask and is improving. The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, but it is not in shock. She also has hypotension and dyspnea, which are likely due to COPD and volume overload, with pneumonia unlikely. The patient's leukocytosis is resolving, likely due to recent prednisone use. Her hypercalcemia has resolved, but she still has electrolyte imbalances that need to be managed. The patient has been placed on DNR/DNI status and is awaiting further discussion regarding goals of care with the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is tenuous and requires close monitoring. If not managed properly, it can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath may worsen if her COPD exacerbation is not effectively managed. This could result in respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has ongoing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypercalcemia, which needs to be managed to avoid complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
4. Infection: Although pneumonia is currently unlikely, there is a possibility of underlying infection such as pneumonia. If not identified and treated early"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly lady with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU due to persistent dyspnea. She has been tolerating a Venturi mask and is improving. The patient's blood pressure has been labile, responding to 2 250 boluses throughout the day. Her confusion from the previous day has resolved, and she is now attentive and follows commands. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/54 to 133/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for mild confusion in the morning. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The troponin-T level is within normal range, and the CK/CKMB levels are not significantly elevated.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's dyspnea is likely due to COPD and volume overload, with pneumonia unlikely. She has shown significant improvement since admission and no longer requires more than a nasal cannula for respiratory support. The patient will continue to receive Prednisone for a 2-week taper, frequent alb/ipratrop nebs, and BiPAP as needed, with oxygen saturation levels titrated between 88"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with severe COPD admitted for an acute exacerbation. She was hot natured overnight but responded well to IV fluids. The patient is currently on a nasal cannula for respiratory support with SpO2 at 97%. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/46 mmHg to 133/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The patient's allergies, last doses of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are noted. There are no changes in the patient's medical, social, or family history or review of systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and acute exacerbation increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is crucial.
2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's COPD and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Frequent assessment of respiratory status and sputum cultures should be considered.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and severe illness increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic UF heparin to reduce this risk.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on pantoprazole"
