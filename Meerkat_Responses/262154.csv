","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. She meets the criteria for sepsis with tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory fatigue. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and requires rate control. Her sodium levels are high, likely due to saline resuscitation or impaired free water access. Her potassium levels are low and needs repletion. The patient's CURB-65 score indicates a 15-40% mortality rate within 30 days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated white blood cell count. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. If not controlled, this can lead to hemodynamic instability and further complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, which can be caused by saline resuscitation or"

   tiring, increased thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
   Housestaff discussed code status again with the patient
s niece [**Name (NI) 2006**]
   in [**State 966**] who indicated she is full code prior to intubation.
   Intubated orally without noted difficulty. Also developed atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension prior to
   intubation.  Improved with esmolol, lopressor, and finally diltiazem.
   Aggressively volume repleted, I/O 4.8 L, poor urine output overnight
   albeit starting to pick up this am.  A-line placed.  Ventilated,
   sedated on am rounds, appears very comfortable.  Tachy, irreg at 126,
   BP 115/60 Ventilator settings as above.  Lungs with diminished BS
   throughout, no wheeze, scattered crackles L > R.  Tachy, no murmur. Abd
   soft not distended, occasional BS. No peripheral edema.  Labs as above,
   leukocytosis worsening.  CXR with increased LLL infiltrate, mild fluid
   overload.  Main issues remain hypovolemic vs. septic shock  exacerbated
   by new afib with rapid VR which is better controlled this morning.
   Plan to switch to amiodarone for afib.  Source of sepsis likely lung,
   gram stain shows GPC and GNR, urine legionella antigen negative.  Plan
   to discontinue levoquin, continue vanco/zosyn.  OGT in place, plan to
   start tube feeds.  Hypernatremia resolving with hydration and now free
   water replacement.  I agree with assessment and plan as per Dr.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis, and she requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory fatigue. Her blood work indicates leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which is an infection of the lungs acquired outside of the hospital setting. The patient's oxygenation is borderline with a PaO2 of 60, and she is at risk for worsening respiratory distress.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis as indicated by tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis with a pulmonary source of infection. She requires aggressive volume repletion and early goal-directed therapy for sepsis.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response prior to intubation. This condition requires rate control to prevent cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or heart failure.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to respiratory fatigue. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure of 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's blood glucose level is 153 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 30.5 K/uL, hematocrit is 32.3%, platelet count is 395 K/uL, creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is 0.08 ng/mL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and sepsis. The CURB-65 score predicts a 30-day mortality rate of 15-40%. The plan includes initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin, non-invasive ventilation, intravenous fluids, pressors if needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg, and follow-up sputum culture and blood cultures.

Other findings and assessments include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernat"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. She was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to the initiation of invasive ventilation and intubation due to tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory fatigue. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired bacterial pneumonia with hypoxia requiring non-rebreather mask. Her CURB-65 score indicates a 30-day mortality rate of 15-40%. She is being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria for tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated white blood cell count with a pulmonary source of infection. She requires careful monitoring and management.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. She was given lopressor and diltiazem to control her heart rate.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 153 mEq/L. It may be due to saline resuscitation or impaired free water access. Further investigation and management are required.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalemia with"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of HTN presented with hypoxia, dyspnea,
   found to have a LLL pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis:  Patient meets SIRS criteria for tachycardia, tachypnea, and
   WBC count with pulmonary source of infection.  Started on Levoflox,
   Zosyn, Vanc.
   - Place central line today
   - IVF boluses for CVP >11
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Transfuse to Hct > 30
   - Continue Vanc/zosyn/levoflox
   - f/u sputum, blood, and urine Cx
   - Pressors for MAP >60
   - Mechanical ventilation
 daily SBT, wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Call family to re-confirm goals of care
   .
   # Pneumonia: with hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation currently.
   Respiratory alkalosis is likely from hyperventilation. Borderline
   oxygenation with PaO2 60. CURB-65 score is [**4-14**] (depending on RR),
   predicting a30-day mortality rate of 15-40%.
   - pip-tazo, levoflox, and vancomycin for healthcare-associated
   pneumonia (from nursing home)
   - Early goal directed therapy for sepsis as above.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - blood cx
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient required lopressor x1 and
   diltiazem x1.  Patient as high as 170s for rate.
   - Rate control with  diltiazem 30mg PO QID and titrate up
   - IV dilt as needed.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: with hyperchloremia, might be due to saline
   resuscitation, or given hypovolemia on exam, could be due to impaired
   free water access due to mental status.
   - add on osmolality and lytes on admission urine sample
   - free water bolus
   - monitor chemistry closely; avoid decreasing Na by more than 0.5
   mEq/L/hr
   - monitor I/O
   .
   # Hypokalemia: from alkalemia vs. GI losses (unlikely given no history
   of diarrhea) vs. renal losses
   - replete as needed; but avoid overrepletion if etiology is
   transcellular shift
   - serial K checks

   I saw and examined the patient with the ICU resident and fellow and
   reviewed 24 hour events.  I was present during key portions of the
   services provided.  Patient remains critically ill.  Required
   intubation overnight given progressive respiratory failure, clinically
   tiring, increased thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
   Housestaff discussed code status again with the patient
s niece [**Name (NI) 2006**]
   in [**State 966**] who indicated she is full code prior to intubation.
   Intubated orally without noted difficulty. Also developed atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and hypotension prior to
   intubation.  Improved with esmolol, lopressor, and finally diltiazem.
   Aggressively volume repleted, I/O 4.8 L, poor urine output overnight
   albeit starting to pick up this am.  A-line placed.  Ventilated,
   sedated on am rounds, appears very comfortable.  Tachy, irreg at 126,
   BP 115/60 Ventilator settings as above.  Lungs with diminished BS
   throughout, no wheeze, scattered crackles L > R.  Tachy, no murmur. Abd
   soft not distended, occasional BS. No peripheral edema.  Labs as above,
   leukocytosis worsening.  CXR with increased LLL infiltrate, mild fluid
   overload.  Main issues remain hypovolemic vs. septic shock  exacerbated
   by new afib with rapid VR which is better controlled this morning.
   Plan to switch to amiodarone for afib.  Source of sepsis likely lung,
   gram stain shows GPC and GNR, urine legionella antigen negative.  Plan
   to discontinue levoquin, continue vanco/zosyn.  OGT in place, plan to
   start tube feeds.  Hypernatremia resolving with hydration and now free
   water replacement.  I agree with assessment and plan as per Dr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and a left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been critically ill and required intubation overnight due to progressive respiratory failure. She also developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate and hypotension, which improved with esmolol, lopressor, and diltiazem. The patient has been aggressively volume-repleted, but her urine output has been poor. She is currently ventilated and sedated, appearing very comfortable. Her main issues include hypovolemic vs. septic shock, exacerbated by new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is better controlled this morning. The source of sepsis is likely the lung, with gram stain showing gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The plan is to discontinue levoquin, continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Hypernatremia is resolving with hydration and free water replacement. The patient remains critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed left lower lobe pneumonia, which is likely the source of her sepsis. She requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics (pip-tazo, levoflox, and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia) and close monitoring of her sputum and blood cultures. She may"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of HTN presented with hypoxia, dyspnea,
   found to have a LLL pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis:
   .
   # Pneumonia: with hypoxia requiring NRB currently. Respiratory
   alkalosis is likely from hyperventilation. Borderline oxygenation with
   PaO2 60. CURB-65 score is [**4-14**] (depending on RR), predicting a30-day
   mortality rate of 15-40%.
   - pip-tazo and vancomycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia (from
   nursing home)
   - non-invasive ventilation for now but might need intubation if
   respiratory status worsens
   - IVF
   - pressors if needed to maintain MAP > 60
   - f/u sputum cx
   - blood cx
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient required lopressor x1 and
   diltiazem x1
   .
   # Hypernatremia: with hyperchloremia, might be due to saline
   resuscitation, or given hypovolemia on exam, could be due to impaired
   free water access due to mental status.
   - add on osmolality and lytes on admission urine sample
   - free water bolus
   - monitor chemistry closely; avoid decreasing Na by more than 0.5
   mEq/L/hr
   - monitor I/O
   .
   # Hypokalemia: from alkalemia vs. GI losses (unlikely given no history
   of diarrhea) vs. renal losses
   - replete as needed; but avoid overrepletion if etiology is
   transcellular shift
   - serial K checks
   - if hypoK persists, will check urinary K level and TTKG

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and requires invasive ventilation. Her CURB-65 score predicts a 30-day mortality rate of 15-40%. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia with hyperchloremia, and hypokalemia. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pressors, and other ICU care interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and the need for invasive ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential risk for sepsis. Monitoring for signs of systemic infection and organ dysfunction is important.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed carefully to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels require careful management to avoid complications such as neurological dysfunction.
5. Hypokalemia: Monitoring and managing the patient's potassium levels are essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobilization in the ICU, there is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/58 to 134/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. She has been receiving multiple intravenous medications including midazolam, fentanyl, phenylephrine, amiodarone, famotidine, diltiazem, and heparin sodium. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal potassium levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's renal function is normal based on creatinine levels. The patient's medical team is monitoring her closely and has planned for daily spontaneous breathing trials to assess weaning off mechanical ventilation. They are also considering transitioning the patient to oral amiodar"

   nosocomial pneumonia, still with large amount of secretions albeit
   reportedly thinner.  Large amount of oral secretions noted by nursing.
   Hemodynamically more stable now that she is in SR, amiodarone drip to

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (community-acquired), and atrial fibrillation. She is currently critically ill, sedated, and mechanically ventilated. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin), amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient is already experiencing nosocomial pneumonia, which may lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could progress to septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially multiple organ failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may recur, leading to poor cardiac output and potential heart failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has previously experienced hypernatremia, which may recur if fluid balance is not properly managed.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia needs to be carefully monitored and managed to avoid complications related to low potassium levels.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and critical illness. Prophylactic measures should be continued.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient"

- The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia.
- She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and community-acquired pneumonia.
- She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia requiring respiratory support.
- Her blood cultures were drawn at 12:57 PM on 12/8/2105, and she has been started on antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Vancomycin.
- She is also being treated for hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to tachycardia, tachypnea, and an elevated white blood cell count, and has a pulmonary source of infection. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) for sepsis and pneumonia, as well as amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient has been unable to wean off pressors today, indicating ongoing hypotension. Her blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures are pending. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and a respiratory system compliance of 39.8 cmH2O/mL. 

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient also has hypernatremia and hypokalemia, which have been addressed. 

The plan includes continuing antibiotics, IV fluids for maintaining central venous pressure (CVP)"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (community-acquired), and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been on multiple pressors for hypotension and is currently receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a review of systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion and mucosal damage.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating the possibility of fluid overload.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction.
6. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are within the high range, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of glycemic control.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels suggest a possible coagulation disorder.
8. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever may indicate an ongoing infection.

   requiring low dose pressors.  Low grade fevers. Suctioned for copious
   thick tan secretions.  Scattered rhonchi and occasional wheeze on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She was diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently critically ill and requires mechanical ventilation. Her blood pressure is being supported with low-dose pressors. She has leukocytosis and a fever, and is receiving IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn and vancomycin), and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. She also has mild aortic stenosis and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, with normal biventricular cavity sizes and preserved global biventricular systolic function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation is currently being used to support her breathing. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory status if the pneumonia does not improve.

3. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia: Given the patient's background of nursing home residence, there is a possibility of healthcare-associated pneumonia, which may require adjustments in antibiotic therapy.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Vent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is mechanically ventilated and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn), vasopressors, and sedatives. Her blood glucose levels have been elevated, but within normal limits for the ICU setting. Her WBC count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, but her creatinine levels are slightly elevated. The patient's condition remains critical, and the medical team is closely monitoring her vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, fever, and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pneumonia. If her oxygenation cannot be adequately maintained or if she experiences further deterioration in lung function, she may develop severe hypoxemia leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is consistent with sepsis, indicated by the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and leukocytosis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) has been initiated.

2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the left lower lobe pneumonia. Continuous diuresis and weaning of pressure support should be continued as tolerated to improve oxygenation and potentially allow for extubation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient initially had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, but was able to maintain normal sinus rhythm overnight. Amiodarone has been continued for rhythm control, and IV diltiazem can be used as needed if the patient returns to atrial fibrillation.

Potential Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and fever curve indicate ongoing infection. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, trending WBC and fever curve, and maintaining appropriate antibiotic therapy to control the infection.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation, but did not tolerate diuresis. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Weaning of vent settings should be done cautiously based on the patient's tolerance.
3. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Regular follow-up of sputum cultures is important to assess the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed with appropriate anticoagulation and rate control measures. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and adjusting medication dosages as needed is crucial.
5. Complications related to mechanical ventilation: As the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for healthcare-associated pneumonia, anticoagulants (SQ UF Heparin) for DVT prophylaxis, and a stress ulcer prophylaxis (H2 blocker). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 113/47 to 160/64 mmHg, heart rate between 63-80 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 97%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin T levels, elevated D-dimer, and slightly low platelet count. The patient has been receiving daily sputum, blood, and urine cultures, and her C. diff test was negative.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, she is at risk of developing V"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Delirium: Older adults, especially those with multiple comorbidities and on multiple medications, are at higher risk of developing delirium.
6. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, which increases the risk of drug-drug interactions.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's renal function is slightly impaired (elevated creatinine), and there are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels ("

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide a history. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/46 to 160/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm with normal heart sounds. The patient's fluid balance has been maintained with appropriate intake and output measurements. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 242. The patient's respiratory bronchospasm index (RSBI) is 81.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide history. 

Key Findings:
- Patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient's secretions are unchanged, with thick tan mucus.
- White blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, indicating possible infection.
- The patient is experiencing diarrhea, and a stool sample has been sent for Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) testing.
- Chest X-ray suggests a possible pleural effusion, with concerns of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema.
- A CT chest will be obtained today to further evaluate the condition.
- Repeat sputum gram stain, C+S, blood, and urine cultures will be done.
- Antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) will continue.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB), but remains in sinus rhythm on amiodarone.
- Hypotension occurred due to hypovolemia during diuresis, which improved with fluids but also required increased inotrope support, now being weaned down.
- The patient is receiving tube feeds at goal, and efforts are being made for glycemic control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is diagnosed with AFib, which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, a type of lung infection that can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of complications.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of pneumonia that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.
6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of certain medications. Prophylaxis is being provided to prevent these"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. She was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is being treated with mechanical ventilation, antibiotics (Zosyn and vancomycin), diuresis, and anticoagulation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 54-78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/47 to 141/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of sputum cultures and adherence to proper ventilator hygiene practices are crucial to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and advanced age increase the risk of DVT/PE. The patient is receiving subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin as prophylaxis, which helps reduce the risk of clot formation.
3. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Monitoring of blood, urine, and sput"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. She was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), fentanyl, midazolam, and phenylephrine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Nosocomial infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay and use of central lines, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic H2 blockers should be continued.
5. Delirium: Older patients in the ICU are prone to developing delirium. Regular reorientation and sensory stimulation should be provided.
6. Glycemic control: Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is important to maintain tight glycemic control and prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
7. Renal function: The patient's renal function should be monitored closely due to the use of nephrotoxic medications like vancomycin and potential acute kidney injury.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing frothy sputum and Cheyenne breathing pattern, indicating possible fluid overload. She has been receiving diuretics, Lasix, to manage this. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. Her lab results show leukocytosis and elevated D-dimer levels. She has been on antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) for bacterial pneumonia and is also being treated for C. difficile infection. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The plan includes continuing the current antibiotic regimen, increasing Vancomycin based on trough levels, maintaining MAP goal of >60, following up on bronch cultures, and performing daily spontaneous breathing tests to wean vent settings as tolerated. Additionally, the patient is being treated for atrial fibrillation and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's baseline includes being oriented, wheelchair-bound but able to stand and pivot, incontinent, with periods of agitation and combative behavior. She has been coughing prior to admission and has a history of loose stools, but tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) have been negative. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/47 to 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as other medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, and phenylephrine. The plan is to continue the current antibiotic regimen, maintain mean arterial pressure above 60, follow up on bron"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. She was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient continues to be hypotensive despite being on neorupulmonary synchrony (neo) at 2.2 mg/hr. Leukocytosis has improved, and she is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin (Vanc), and ceftriaxone (Rocephin) for healthcare-associated pneumonia. She is mechanically ventilated and is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is currently in sinus rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still hypotensive despite being on neo and has leukocytosis. This indicates ongoing infection and sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and ABG values indicate respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation parameters, and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) are necessary. Weaning off mechanical ventilation should be done cautiously.
3. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is resistant to initial antibiotic therapy, indicating a healthcare-associated infection. Cultures should be monitored,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is being treated with multiple antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia and is also receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there is a decline in oxygenation or increased carbon dioxide levels.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress if her vital signs deteriorate or if her blood cultures show positive results for bacteria.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient may experience recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke if not managed appropriately.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient may be at risk of stress ulcer bleeding due to the use of corticosteroids and H2"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They are unresponsive and intubated. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and PS of 8 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/31 mmHg to 156/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (nosocomial), acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactic acid levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's renal function is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and decreased peripheral pulses increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient has pneumonia, which could be due to a nosocomial infection acquired during their hospital stay.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and receiving antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) for healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has improved to normal sinus rhythm overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with left lower lobe pneumonia, which can lead to complications such as worsening respiratory failure or development of secondary infections.
2. Sepsis: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, which indicates ongoing infection and potential progression to septic shock.
3. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, requiring advanced ventilation support. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rhythm is unstable, and if not managed properly, there is a risk of recurrent episodes or progression to more severe arrhythmias.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobilization and critical illness, there is an increased risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Bronchoscopy without much cleanout of left lung - some mild mucous
   plugging but mostly clear.
   - Remains Neo dependent, but diuresed ~1L despite this.  Only given one
   dose of lasix in AM.
   - Family to come Wednesday.  Suggest having Nursing home staff present
   for family meeting as family seems not to know her baseline well.
   We'll need to call them Monday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension presenting with hypoxia, dyspnea, and left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, community-acquired pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple pressors for hypotension, and has a positive fluid balance. Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's condition remains unstable, with worsening WBC, fever, and hypotension despite receiving antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin). Repeat blood cultures are pending, and a chest CT is planned to evaluate for pleural fluid that can be tapped. There are concerns about a superimposed infectious source not being covered by the current antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause of pneumonia is not effectively treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest ongoing sepsis. Failure to control the infection may lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with RVR. If not managed appropriately, this condition"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient continues to be hypotensive and has leukocytosis worsening. She is on antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) for community-acquired pneumonia. There is concern for a superimposed infectious source not being covered with the current antibiotics, so repeat blood cultures are pending.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR but is now in normal sinus rhythm overnight. She is on amiodarone and will have her dose changed tomorrow. IV diltiazem will be used as needed if she goes back into atrial fibrillation.

3. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation improved overnight but is still ventilator-dependent. She is on SIMV mode and her ABG shows a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 58, and PaO2 of 112. The plan is to change to pressure support if tolerated today.

4. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has left lower lobe pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics for CAP. There is concern"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. She continues to be hypotensive and is receiving intravenous antibiotics. Her white blood cell count has decreased from yesterday, and she is being monitored for any signs of organ dysfunction. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly overnight, and she has been placed on SIMV ventilation mode. She is also receiving anticoagulation prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is still hypotensive, indicating ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to assess the response to treatment.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest showed little improvement in right apical opacities, indicating that the pneumonia may not be resolving as expected. This could potentially lead to worsening respiratory status or the development of complications such as abscess formation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with amiodarone, but she may still require additional medications to control her heart rate. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and electrolyte levels is important to prevent further complications.

4. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have multiple lines including an arterial line and PICC line. The patient's vital signs show labile blood pressures, with both high and low readings throughout the day. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and their heart rate is relatively stable. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals some abnormalities, such as diminished pulses in both lower extremities, bilateral lower extremity edema, and cool, mottled extremities. The abdomen is described as soft with bowel sounds present but distended. Neurologic assessment is not possible due to sedation.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL. White blood cell count is elevated at 20.4 K/uL, suggesting an ongoing infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far. Other lab results show slightly elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal kidney function tests, including creatinine and BUN.

The patient's conditions include atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, nosocomial pneumonia, and anemia. The treatment plan includes administration of amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for pneumonia, and continued pressor support for hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis leading to septic shock,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) order. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently on a trial of pressure support. The patient's leukocytosis has decreased from yesterday, and her fever curve is being monitored. She is still hypotensive despite neo at 1.5 this morning. The patient is also being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia and atrial fibrillation with RVR. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infection: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, she is at risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobilization and decreased mobility due to being on mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Medication complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics. These medications may have side effects or drug interactions that could lead to complications.
5. Organ dysfunction: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with pneumonia, respiratory failure, and shock. She is currently in the ICU and has been sedated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 118/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 436 K/uL, blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include the patient's respiratory failure due to bacterial pneumonia, septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. The goals of care have been discussed with the patient's healthcare proxy, and it has been determined that she does not want escalation of care. The patient's current medications include fentanyl for pain management, phenylephrine for blood pressure support, and prophylactic antibiotics.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. He was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and bacterial community-acquired pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged or persistent respiratory failure: The patient may experience difficulty breathing and maintaining adequate oxygenation, leading to further deterioration of respiratory function.

2. Organ dysfunction: The septic shock can lead to impaired organ function, including kidney injury (as indicated by elevated creatinine levels), liver dysfunction (as indicated by elevated bilirubin levels), and cardiovascular complications.

3. Infective endocarditis: The presence of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of infective endocarditis, especially if there are predisposing factors such as intravenous catheters or previous valve abnormalities.

4. Antibiotic resistance: Prolonged use of antibiotics increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and adjust the treatment accordingly.

5. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Proper infection control measures should be implemented to minimize these risks.
