   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Patient with a number of factors likely contributing. He has known
   bilateral pulmonary emboli, and has been on a heparin drip for this.
   Although this was stopped for one hour today, it seems unlikely this
   fully accounts for his decompensation; it will, however, contribute to
   his much reduced capacity to handle other problems. His chest x-ray
   demonstrates worsening left-sided process, which would be more
   consistent with possible infectious etiology, especially given long
   period of neutropenia and cough and concurrent fever at time of
   transfer; it is possible that as counts recover, he may be mounting
   more of an immune response to underlying pulmonary infectious process.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage is another consideration, though this seems less
   likely given no hemoptysis and normal platelet count. ATRA syndrome is
   another possiblity, though less likely to produce such uni-lateral
   findings. PCP has also been discussed. Patient is doing well, now
   satting well on 2L NC
   - Repeat ABG this morning to assess oxygenation, pH, lactate, and CO2
   - Titrate down oxygen as/if tolerated
   - Continue voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and levofloxacin
   - Continue heparin drip for PE
   - Sputum culture
   - Will not bronch at this point  as the infections are likely bacterial
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #) Fevers: Patient has had ongoing fevers during his stay. Differential
   has included secondary to medications, occult infection (culture data
   has all been negative to date aside from Norovirus), ATRA syndrome. At
   time of transfer, noted to have fever to 103. Less likely to be due to
   PE unless pt has pulmonary necrosis, as pt has no pleuritic chest pain
   associated with pulmonary necrosis.
   - Cultures pending, continue to follow up
   - Continue voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and levofloxacin
   - Appreciate ID continued recommendations
   - Follow up aspergillus and beta-glucan which are pending.
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers.
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   - LENI
s to rule out DVT
   - f/u blood culture
   - obtain x-ray of the right foot
   - continue abx as above
   .
   #) PE: As discussed above. Given mild calf pain, must ensure no DVT
   that could further compromise respiratory function.
   - Continue IV heparin as discussed above
   - Obtain LENI's to rule out DVT
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr bumped up from 1.0 to 1.3. Pt was very
   sweaty and feverish, and had lots of insensible loss
   - IVF today
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Recent baseline appears to be in mid-20's (21-23). Currently
   25 which may represent recovering cell lines versus hemo-concentration.
   - Continue to follow trend
   - DIC labs unremarkable, will continue to follow at least daily, more
   often if clinical suspicion for bleeding arises
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   #) Leukopenia:
   - Continuing to monitor
   .
   #) APML: Status-post 7+4 and ATRA, which was increased to 50 mg
   yesterday ([**2109-8-14**]). He is status-post bone marrow biopsy today which
   was suggestive of remission.
   - Follow up final pathology report
   - Continue ATRA per oncology after further discussion
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #) Intracranial hemorrhage: Stable on last imaging. No CNS changes at
   present. Continuing heparin at present given pulmonary emboli, low
   threshold to re-image head.
   .
   #) Nausea, emesis: Patient reports that this has been in intermittent
   complaint. Norovirus was positive earlier in stay.
   - Checking c. difficile should he have any dirrhea/stool
   - Anti-emetics PRN

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU, once respiratory status improves and stable, can
   transfer back to BMT for further workup of other problems
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently on ATRA therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and has multiple medical complications.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has known bilateral pulmonary emboli and is on a heparin drip. His chest x-ray shows worsening left-sided findings, suggesting a possible infectious etiology, especially considering his long period of neutropenia and concurrent fever at the time of transfer. Other considerations include pulmonary hemorrhage, ATRA syndrome, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient is doing well on 2L NC and requires further evaluation.

2. Fevers: The patient has had ongoing fevers during his stay. Differential diagnoses include secondary to medications, occult infection (with negative cultures aside from Norovirus), ATRA syndrome, and pulmonary necrosis. Cultures are pending, and the patient should continue to be followed up. Antibiotics should be continued as above, and follow-up ID recommendations should be appreciated.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to infection, PE, and fevers. Antibiotics should be continued, heparin should be continued, and cultures should be followed up. Fever management with Tylenol should be continued.

4. Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Patient with a number of factors likely contributing. He has known
   bilateral pulmonary emboli, and has been on a heparin drip for this.
   Although this was stopped for one hour today, it seems unlikely this
   fully accounts for his decompensation; it will, however, contribute to
   his much reduced capacity to handle other problems. His chest x-ray
   demonstrates worsening left-sided process, which would be more
   consistent with possible infectious etiology, especially given long
   period of neutropenia and cough and concurrent fever at time of
   transfer; it is possible that as counts recover, he may be mounting
   more of an immune response to underlying pulmonary infectious process.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage is another consideration, though this seems less
   likely given no hemoptysis and normal platelet count. ATRA syndrome is
   another possiblity, though less likely to produce such uni-lateral
   findings. PCP has also been discussed.
   - Repeat ABG this morning to assess oxygenation, pH, lactate, and CO2
   - Titrate down oxygen as/if tolerated
   - Continue voriconazole, vancomycin added and infusing now per
   discussion with oncology, and aztreonam; will double cover for gram
   negative organisms (including pseudomonas) with levofloxacin
   - Continue heparin drip for PE
   - Will discuss possible bronchoscopy for culture data and evaluation to
   help guide therapy, though may need to be intubated for this given
   tenuous status, and given appearance on CXR, most likely to be
   bacterial pneumonia
   - Discussed possible need for intubation with patient and wife at
   length and what that would entail, both agree this would be what
   patient wants
   - Sputum if patient is able to produce
   .
   #) Fevers: Patient has had ongoing fevers during his stay. Differential
   has included secondary to medications, occult infection (culture data
   has all been negative to date aside from Norovirus), ATRA syndrome. At
   time of transfer, noted to have fever to 103.
   - Cultures pending, continue to follow up-
   - Discuss bronchoscopy as noted above to help guide diagnosis and
   anti-microbial therapy
   - Tylenol now to help with fever to see if this improves tachycardia
   - Added vancomycin, continuing aztreonam and voriconazole
   - Appreciate ID continued recommendations
   - Follow up aspergillus and beta-glucan which are pending.
   .
   #) PE: As discussed above. Given mild calf pain, must ensure no DVT
   that could further compromise respiratory function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), status-post 7+4 chemotherapy and currently on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary emboli and has been on a heparin drip. He is now experiencing worsening left-sided process on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible infectious etiology. Other potential complications include pulmonary hemorrhage, ATRA syndrome, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to various factors such as known bilateral pulmonary emboli, worsening left-sided process on chest X-ray, and ongoing fever.
2. Infectious etiology: The patient's symptoms, including cough, fever, and worsening left-sided process on chest X-ray, suggest an underlying pulmonary infectious process. Cultures are pending.
3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: Although less likely given no hemoptysis and normal platelet count, it should still be considered.
4. ATRA syndrome: This syndrome can occur during ATRA therapy and present with symptoms like fever, lung infiltrates, and respiratory distress. It seems less likely to produce such unilateral findings.
5. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): PCP has been discussed as a possibility, but further evaluation is"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (APML, ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM):
 HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  As
   counts coming back may blossom increased pulmonary infiltrates.  Agree
   with broad bacterial  and fungal coverage given underlying leukemia and
   prolonged neutropenia.  Decreased oxygen requirements overnight, now on
   2 L NC.  Repeat GS, C & S, patient is able to expectorate.  Followup on
   blood and urine cultures.

 FEVER:  Likely secondary to pulmonary source as discussed above.
   Also has erythema/warmth over right medial ankle with pain on passive
   ROM.  While this may be related to cellulitis which should be covered
   with current abx, or noninfectious etiology (e.g., gout), also
   concerned for septic joint. No documented positive blood culutres over
   course.  Repeat culutres sent.  Foot/ankle films.
 PE/ DVT:  Pain in LE, concern for extending clot on heparin.
   Therapeutic PTT.  LENIs today.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Given emesis, poor po  intake, likely secondary
   to relative intravascular depletion and prerenal state.  Tachycardic.
   Relative hypotensive overnight, responsive to IVF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute on chronic respiratory distress. They have been diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient is currently receiving heparin therapy for the pulmonary emboli.

Overnight, the patient experienced a fever of 103.0 degrees Fahrenheit and exhibited signs of hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. They also had borderline oxygen saturation on 100% non-rebreather (NRB). The patient received Tylenol and a 250 cc normal saline (NS) bolus, which improved their condition. Antibiotics were broadened to include levofloxacin.

The patient had an episode of greenish hematemesis overnight, but it was not witnessed by the healthcare team. The patient's allergies include cefepime, and their last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 08:16 AM on 08/16/2109.

The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 2,200 units per hour and is receiving other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a maximum of 103.4 degrees Fahrenheit and a current temperature of 36 degrees Celsius. The patient's heart rate has been consistently elevated, ranging from 108 to"

   effusion, or significant soft tissue abnormality. Minimal degenerative
   changes seen at the talonavicular and intertarsal joints.
CXR (my read): left lung opacities, stable from yesterday. PICC line visualized.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely [**1-7**] to infectious process in
   left lung, based on CXR, physical exam findings.  Also, new PE on diff
   bc pt was off heparin gtt for 1hr prior to a BM biopsy, however
   unlikely.  Even so, pt being currently treated with heparin gtt.
   pulmonary hemorrhage unlikley given no hemoptysis and normal platelet
   count. ATRA syndrome is another possiblity, though less likely to
   produce such uni-lateral findings. PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 609**], viral on diff though
   several studies came back neg so far. Patient is stable, now on 5L NC
   - titrate down oxygen as/if tolerated
   - continue broad coverage voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and
   levofloxacin
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - keep sending sputum cultures (either sample is contaminated or
   negative so far)
   - consider BAL in future if no org is isolated and pt does not improve
   clinically
   - f/u ID recs
   - sputum sample on [**8-14**] shows atypical cells, likely squamous cell ca ->
   f/u BMT rec re: work-up for that
   .
   #) Fevers: continues to have fevers, likely [**1-7**] to infectious process
   in lungs
   - f/u pending micro studies
   - continue voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and levofloxacin
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers.
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   - LENI
s  ruled out DVT
   - x-ray ruled our fracture
   - joint fluid and stain ruled out septic arthritis, gout/pseudogout
   - given that pt is on heparin gtt, ankle swelling likely caused by
   small bleed into joint
   - no work-up necessary at this time
   - pain control with current meds
   .
   #) PE: LENIs indicate no new DVT
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr bumped up from 1.0 to 1.3 intially, now
   resolved with hydration.
   - IVF prn
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Recent baseline appears to be in mid-20's (21-23). Currently
   23 which may represent recovering cell lines versus hemo-concentration.
   - continue to follow trend
   - DIC labs intially unremarkable, will send again if clinical suspicion
   arises
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #) Leukopenia: likely [**1-7**] chemotherapy
   - continue to monitor
   - neutropenic diet and precautions as needed
   .
   #) APML: Status-post 7+4 and ATRA, which was increased to 50 mg on
   [**2109-8-14**]. He is s/p recent bone marrow biopsy which was suggestive of
   remission.
   - Follow up final pathology report
   - Continue ATRA per oncology
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #) Intracranial hemorrhage: Stable on last imaging. No CNS changes at
   present.
   - continuing heparin at present given pulmonary emboli, low threshold
   to re-image head.
   .
   #) Nausea, emesis: Patient reports that this has been in intermittent
   complaint. Norovirus was positive earlier in stay.
   - check c. difficile should he have any dirrhea/stool
   - anti-emetics PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute leukemia and respiratory failure. On admission, the patient had a fever, and there were concerns about a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right medial ankle. The patient's allergy history includes cefepime, and there have been no recent antibiotic reactions. The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, vancomycin, voriconazole, and aztreonam.

The patient's vital signs have been monitored closely, showing elevated temperatures, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring have been ongoing, with a total fluid intake of 2,147 mL and output of 1,297 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood products and urine output have also been documented.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, bronchial sounds in the left lung fields, crackles in both lung fields, and tenderness in the right ankle. There is also evidence of edema and warmth in the right forefoot.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Patient with a number of factors likely contributing. He has known
   bilateral pulmonary emboli, and has been on a heparin drip for this.
   Although this was stopped for one hour today, it seems unlikely this
   fully accounts for his decompensation; it will, however, contribute to
   his much reduced capacity to handle other problems. His chest x-ray
   demonstrates worsening left-sided process, which would be more
   consistent with possible infectious etiology, especially given long
   period of neutropenia and cough and concurrent fever at time of
   transfer; it is possible that as counts recover, he may be mounting
   more of an immune response to underlying pulmonary infectious process.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage is another consideration, though this seems less
   likely given no hemoptysis and normal platelet count. ATRA syndrome is
   another possiblity, though less likely to produce such uni-lateral
   findings. PCP has also been discussed. Patient is doing well, now
   satting well on 2L NC
   - Repeat ABG this morning to assess oxygenation, pH, lactate, and CO2
   - Titrate down oxygen as/if tolerated
   - Continue voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and levofloxacin
   - Continue heparin drip for PE
   - Sputum culture
   - Will not bronch at this point  as the infections are likely bacterial
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #) Fevers: Patient has had ongoing fevers during his stay. Differential
   has included secondary to medications, occult infection (culture data
   has all been negative to date aside from Norovirus), ATRA syndrome. At
   time of transfer, noted to have fever to 103. Less likely to be due to
   PE unless pt has pulmonary necrosis, as pt has no pleuritic chest pain
   associated with pulmonary necrosis.
   - Cultures pending, continue to follow up
   - Continue voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and levofloxacin
   - Appreciate ID continued recommendations
   - Follow up aspergillus and beta-glucan which are pending.
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers.
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   - LENI
s to rule out DVT
   - f/u blood culture
   - obtain x-ray of the right foot
   - continue abx as above
   .
   #) PE: As discussed above. Given mild calf pain, must ensure no DVT
   that could further compromise respiratory function.
   - Continue IV heparin as discussed above
   - Obtain LENI's to rule out DVT
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr bumped up from 1.0 to 1.3. Pt was very
   sweaty and feverish, and had lots of insensible loss
   - IVF today
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Recent baseline appears to be in mid-20's (21-23). Currently
   25 which may represent recovering cell lines versus hemo-concentration.
   - Continue to follow trend
   - DIC labs unremarkable, will continue to follow at least daily, more
   often if clinical suspicion for bleeding arises
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   #) Leukopenia:
   - Continuing to monitor
   .
   #) APML: Status-post 7+4 and ATRA, which was increased to 50 mg
   yesterday ([**2109-8-14**]). He is status-post bone marrow biopsy today which
   was suggestive of remission.
   - Follow up final pathology report
   - Continue ATRA per oncology after further discussion
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #) Intracranial hemorrhage: Stable on last imaging. No CNS changes at
   present. Continuing heparin at present given pulmonary emboli, low
   threshold to re-image head.
   .
   #) Nausea, emesis: Patient reports that this has been in intermittent
   complaint. Norovirus was positive earlier in stay.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and currently on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and has multiple medical complications. The patient has known bilateral pulmonary emboli and is on a heparin drip. He has ongoing fevers, right ankle joint pain, forefoot swelling and warmth, acute renal failure, anemia, leukopenia, and nausea/vomiting. He is also being treated for suspected infections with antibiotics and antifungals. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, infections, renal function, and other systemic issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening left-sided process on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of an infectious etiology or pulmonary hemorrhage. Continuous monitoring and titration of oxygen as tolerated are necessary.
2. Fevers: Ongoing fevers may be due to secondary infections, ATRA syndrome, or occult infection. Cultures are pending, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued. Further investigation into potential causes is needed.
3. Tachycardia: This may be secondary to infection, PE, or fevers. Continued antibiotics, heparin gtt, and control of fever with Tylenol are recommended.
4. Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling/warmth: Differential diagnosis includes cellul"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with h/o APML now following chemotherapy has ICU admission
   for respiratory distress.  This has been improved across time with
   antibiotics continued.  Interestingly warm right ankle with fluid now
   tapped and results pending in regards to culture but WBC minimally
   elevated.  He does have one culture with GPC's suggested but limited
   growth.  Additionally [**Location (un) **] virus was positive.  Finally, his
   hospital course was complicated by alveolar hemorrhage and PE.
   1)Respiratory Distress-What we see is clear involvement of left lung
   with multi-focal areas of consolidation on CXR with some improvement of
   areas that appear to be more dominated by edema.  On CXR we see
   persistence with is supported by physical exam.  PE treatment continues
   and no sudden acute symptoms to suggest recurrence.  Will have to
   clarify potential role of chemotherapy. Current diagnosis is multifocal
   pneumonia
   -He maintaines high RR and easy distress with minimal movement leaving
   patient with need for close monitoring
   -If stability seen then will consider bronchoscopy as is high risk at
   this time
   -Will continue to consider possible BOOP from medications given and
   will need to review possible complications in detail
   -Levo/Vanco/Aztreonam/Voriconazole/Nystatin Oral
   -Primary involvement in lung from malignancy
have curious result from
   sputum sample with squamous cell seen ([**2109-8-14**])
will need to evaluate
   for old CXR
s and consider repeat sample if bronchoscopy pursued.
   Important to note is patient did have CXR on [**2109-7-15**] making primary
   lung malignancy with SCCA very very unlikely.
   2)Fever
   -Joint sampling shows blood
likely related to anticoagulation and
   trauma.
   -Will continue to treat pneumonia
   3)APML-
   -Continue to follow WBC counts
   -Continue with Rx per oncology team

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He has been improving with antibiotics but still presents with fever, tachypnea, and mild hypoxia. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and elevated heart rate. Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds on the left side and mild crackles at the apex. The patient has right lower extremity edema and mild pain in movement of the right ankle. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly high platelet count, normal creatinine, and slightly low potassium levels. Blood cultures are negative to date. Imaging shows clearing of diffuse opacities in the left lung but persistent infiltrate and consolidation. Microbiology is pending.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with involvement of the left lung, which is supported by physical exam and chest X-ray findings. Antibiotic treatment will continue, and close monitoring is required. If stability is seen, a bronchoscopy may be considered. The role of chemotherapy in causing the pneumonia should be evaluated.
2. Fever: Joint sampling shows blood likely related to anticoagulation and trauma. Pneumonia treatment will continue.
3. APML: WBC counts will be followed, and treatment per the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely [**1-7**] to infectious process in
   left lung, based on CXR, chest CT and physical exam findings.  Also,
   new PE on diff bc pt was off heparin gtt for 1hr prior to a BM biopsy,
   however unlikely.  Even so, pt being currently treated with heparin
   gtt.  Pulmonary hemorrhage unlikley given no hemoptysis and normal
   platelet count. ATRA syndrome is another possiblity, though less likely
   to produce such uni-lateral findings. PCP is less likely given one
   sided pathology. Viral is less likely given patient has been in the
   hospital and wouldn
t be exposed to usual viral agents like flu, plus
   viral infection would give bilateral patholgoy as well. Bacterial and
   fungal infections are most likely. It is possible that  since patient
   WBC has rebounded, it is mounting an inflammatory response to the
   infections he has in the lungs, namely organizing penumonitis.
   - discuss with radiology regarding CT chest and CXR to try to
   differentiate between infection vs organizing pneumonitis
   - continue broad coverage voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and
   levofloxacin
   - increase vanc dose per ID
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - keep sending sputum cultures (either sample is contaminated or
   negative so far)
   - consider bronch with BAL to rule out active infections, if no
   infection then can treat with steroids for organizing pneumonitis
   - f/u ID recs
   - sputum sample on [**8-14**] shows atypical cells, likely squamous cell ca ->
   f/u BMT rec re: work-up for that
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers.
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   LENI
s  ruled out DVT. X-ray ruled our fracture. Joint fluid and stain
   ruled out septic arthritis, gout/pseudogout.  Given that pt is on
   heparin gtt, ankle swelling likely caused by small bleed into joint
   - no work-up necessary at this time
   - pain control with current meds
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr stable after hydration.
   - IVF prn
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Recent baseline appears to be in mid-20's (21-23).
   - continue to follow trend
   - DIC labs intially unremarkable, will send again if clinical suspicion
   arises
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #) Leukopenia: likely [**1-7**] chemotherapy
   - continue to monitor
   - neutropenic diet and precautions as needed
   .
   #) APML: Status-post 7+4 and ATRA, which was increased to 50 mg on
   [**2109-8-14**]. He is s/p recent bone marrow biopsy which was suggestive of
   remission.
   - Follow up final pathology report
   - Continue ATRA per oncology
   - f/u BMT recs

   #) Intracranial hemorrhage: Stable on last imaging. No CNS changes at
   present.
   - continuing heparin at present given pulmonary emboli, low threshold
   to re-image head.

   #) Nausea, emesis: Patient reports that this has been in intermittent
   complaint. Norovirus was positive earlier in stay.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) status-post 7+4 chemotherapy and currently on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and the imaging studies suggest an infectious process in the left lung. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, as well as ATRA syndrome, pulmonary hemorrhage, and organizing pneumonitis.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely secondary to infection, pulmonary embolism (PE), and fevers.

3. Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth: The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, joint fluid and stain ruled out septic arthritis and gout, and an X-ray ruled out fracture. Given the patient's heparin drip, the ankle swelling is likely caused by a small bleed into the joint.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, but they have stabilized after hydration. The plan is to continue IV fluids as needed and monitor kidney function.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, but it appears to be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely [**1-7**] to infectious process in
   left lung, based on CXR, physical exam findings.  Also, new PE on diff
   bc pt was off heparin gtt for 1hr prior to a BM biopsy, however
   unlikely.  Even so, pt being currently treated with heparin gtt.
   pulmonary hemorrhage unlikley given no hemoptysis and normal platelet
   count. ATRA syndrome is another possiblity, though less likely to
   produce such uni-lateral findings. PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 609**], viral on diff though
   several studies came back neg so far. Patient is stable, now on 5L NC
   - titrate down oxygen as/if tolerated
   - continue broad coverage voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and
   levofloxacin
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - keep sending sputum cultures (either sample is contaminated or
   negative so far)
   - consider BAL in future if no org is isolated and pt does not improve
   clinically
   - f/u ID recs
   - sputum sample on [**8-14**] shows atypical cells, likely squamous cell ca ->

   in lungs
   - f/u pending micro studies
   - continue voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and levofloxacin
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers.
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   - LENI
s  ruled out DVT
   - x-ray ruled our fracture
   - joint fluid and stain ruled out septic arthritis, gout/pseudogout
   - given that pt is on heparin gtt, ankle swelling likely caused by
   small bleed into joint
   - no work-up necessary at this time
   - pain control with current meds
   .
   #) PE: LENIs indicate no new DVT
   - continue heparin gtt
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr bumped up from 1.0 to 1.3 intially, now
   resolved with hydration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently undergoing treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and is now stable on a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of fevers, hypoxia, and bilateral lung opacities on imaging, which are consistent with a pulmonary infectious etiology. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. Other medical conditions include acute renal failure, anemia, leukopenia, right ankle pain and swelling, and a possible pulmonary embolism. The patient's recent bone marrow biopsy suggests remission of APML.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may worsen if his pulmonary infection does not improve or if he develops further complications.
2. Infectious process: The patient's ongoing fevers and worsening lung opacities indicate an ongoing infectious process. It is important to continue monitoring for any changes in sputum cultures or new symptoms.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient is currently on heparin for PE, there is a risk of further clot formation or worsening of existing clots. Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory distress or new symptoms of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for worsening left-sided pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia. The patient's treatment course has been complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE), alveolar hemorrhage, and pneumonia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including voriconazole, aztreonam, nystatin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia - The patient is already being treated with antibiotics, but there may be a need to adjust the dosing of vancomycin and discuss a change in anti-fungal coverage with the ID and BMT team.
2. Pulmonary Embolus - The patient is continuing with heparin therapy and will be monitored for pleuritic chest pain.
3. Ankle Discomfort - There is a concern for joint involvement with hemarthrosis, and the patient's exam will be followed over time.
4. APML - The patient will continue with atra treatment, and there is still some residual disease in the marrow.
5. Acute Renal Failure - There has been some improvement with IVF administration, but the patient is still experiencing impaired skin integrity.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessment and management."

   right-sided
   PICC line. In the right lung, no focal parenchymal opacities have newly
   occurred.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely [**1-7**] to infectious process in
   left lung, based on CXR, chest CT and physical exam findings.  Also,
   new PE on diff bc pt was off heparin gtt for 1hr prior to a BM biopsy,
   however unlikely.  Even so, pt being currently treated with heparin
   gtt.  Pulmonary hemorrhage unlikely given no hemoptysis and normal
   platelet count. ATRA syndrome is another possiblity, though less likely
   to produce such uni-lateral findings. PCP is less likely given one
   sided pathology. Viral is less likely given patient has been in the
   hospital and wouldn
t be exposed to usual viral agents like flu, plus
   viral infection would give bilateral patholgoy as well. Bacterial and
   fungal infections are most likely. It is possible that  since patient
   WBC has rebounded, it is mounting an inflammatory response to the
   infections he has in the lungs, namely organizing penumonitis.
   - discuss with radiology regarding CT chest and CXR to try to
   differentiate between infection vs organizing pneumonitis
   - continue broad coverage voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam (D4) and
   levofloxacin (D3)
   - increase vanc dose per ID, goal trough 15-20
   - check vanc level tomorrow AM
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - keep sending sputum cultures (either sample is contaminated or
   negative so far)
   - consider bronch with BAL to rule out active infections, if no
   infection then can treat with steroids for organizing pneumonitis
   - f/u ID recs
   - sputum sample on [**8-14**] shows atypical cells, likely squamous cell ca ->
   f/u BMT rec re: work-up for that
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers, anemia.
   - continue antibiotics as
   above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   LENI
s  ruled out DVT. X-ray ruled our fracture. Joint fluid and stain
   ruled out septic arthritis, gout/pseudogout.  Given that pt is on
   heparin gtt, ankle swelling likely caused by small bleed into joint
   - no work-up necessary at this time
   - pain control with current meds: oxycontin 30mg q12h and oxycodone
   10mg q3h PRN
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr stable after hydration.
   - IVF prn
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Recent baseline appears to be in mid-20's (21-23).
   - continue to follow trend
   - DIC labs intially unremarkable, will send again if clinical suspicion
   arises
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #) Leukopenia: likely [**1-7**] chemotherapy
   - continue to monitor
   - neutropenic diet and precautions as needed
   .
   #) APML: Status-post 7+4 and ATRA, which was increased to 50 mg on
   [**2109-8-14**]. He is s/p recent bone marrow biopsy which was suggestive of
   remission.
   - Follow up final pathology report
   - Continue ATRA per oncology
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #) Intracranial hemorrhage: Stable on last imaging. No CNS changes at
   present.
   - continuing heparin at present given pulmonary emboli, low threshold
   to re-image head.
   .
   #) Nausea, emesis: Patient reports that this has been in intermittent
   complaint. Norovirus was positive earlier in stay.
   - check c. difficile should he have any diarrhea/stool
   - anti-emetics PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who is currently on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and is now experiencing multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels suggest the possibility of hypoxic respiratory failure. This could be due to an infectious process in the left lung, as indicated by the chest X-ray, CT scan, and physical exam findings.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a new PE on differential diagnosis due to being off heparin for a short period prior to a bone marrow biopsy. However, it is mentioned that he is currently being treated with heparin, making this complication less likely.

3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: This complication is unlikely given the absence of hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and a normal platelet count.

4. ATRA syndrome: Although less likely, ATRA syndrome is another possibility for the patient's respiratory symptoms. However, it typically produces bilateral lung involvement rather than unilateral findings.

5. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): PCP is less likely since the patient has been in the hospital and would not be exposed to usual viral agents like influenza. Viral infections usually cause bilateral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a diagnosis of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has undergone 7+4 chemotherapy and is currently on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to an infectious process in the left lung as indicated by the chest X-ray and CT findings. The patient also has evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), but it is unlikely to be the cause of the respiratory failure. Other possible diagnoses include organizing pneumonia, bacterial or fungal infections, ATRA syndrome, PCP pneumonia, viral infection, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth could be due to cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, a work-up has ruled out DVT and septic arthritis, so it is likely a small bleed into the joint caused by heparin therapy. The patient's acute renal failure is stable after hydration, and the recent baseline for anemia appears to be in the mid-20's. Leukopenia is likely due to chemotherapy, and the patient has a history of APML and ATRA therapy. There are no signs of intracranial hemorrhage or nausea/emesis requiring immediate intervention.

The patient's medications include heparin IV for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8799**] is a 57 year old male with newly diagnosed APML
   status-post 7+4 and currently on ATRA therapy, who is transfered to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Hypoxic respiratory failure: likely [**1-7**] to infectious process in
   left lung, based on CXR, chest CT and physical exam findings.  Also,
   new PE on diff bc pt was off heparin gtt for 1hr prior to a BM biopsy,
   however unlikely.  Even so, pt being currently treated with heparin
   gtt.  Pulmonary hemorrhage unlikley given no hemoptysis and normal
   platelet count. ATRA syndrome is another possiblity, though less likely
   to produce such uni-lateral findings. PCP is less likely given one
   sided pathology. Viral is less likely given patient has been in the
   hospital and wouldn
t be exposed to usual viral agents like flu, plus
   viral infection would give bilateral patholgoy as well. Bacterial and
   fungal infections are most likely. It is possible that  since patient
   WBC has rebounded, it is mounting an inflammatory response to the
   infections he has in the lungs, namely organizing penumonitis.
   - discuss with radiology regarding CT chest and CXR to try to
   differentiate between infection vs organizing pneumonitis
   - continue broad coverage voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam and
   levofloxacin
   - increase vanc dose per ID
   - continue heparin drip for PE
   - keep sending sputum cultures (either sample is contaminated or
   negative so far)
   - consider bronch with BAL to rule out active infections, if no
   infection then can treat with steroids for organizing pneumonitis
   - f/u ID recs
   - sputum sample on [**8-14**] shows atypical cells, likely squamous cell ca ->
   f/u BMT rec re: work-up for that
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   #) Tachycadia: Likely secondary to infection, PE, fevers.
   - continue antibiotics as above
   - continue heparin gtt
   - f/u cultures
   - control fever with tylenol
   .
   #) Right ankle joint pain and forefoot swelling and warmth:
   Differential include cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout and DVT.
   LENI
s  ruled out DVT. X-ray ruled our fracture. Joint fluid and stain
   ruled out septic arthritis, gout/pseudogout.  Given that pt is on
   heparin gtt, ankle swelling likely caused by small bleed into joint
   - no work-up necessary at this time
   - pain control with current meds
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr stable after hydration.
   - IVF prn
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Anemia: Recent baseline appears to be in mid-20's (21-23).
   - continue to follow trend
   - DIC labs intially unremarkable, will send again if clinical suspicion
   arises
   - guaiac stools
   .
   #) Leukopenia: likely [**1-7**] chemotherapy
   - continue to monitor
   - neutropenic diet and precautions as needed
   .
   #) APML: Status-post 7+4 and ATRA, which was increased to 50 mg on
   [**2109-8-14**]. He is s/p recent bone marrow biopsy which was suggestive of
   remission.
   - Follow up final pathology report
   - Continue ATRA per oncology
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   #) Intracranial hemorrhage: Stable on last imaging. No CNS changes at
   present.
   - continuing heparin at present given pulmonary emboli, low threshold
   to re-image head.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and is now being treated for several medical complications.

   57 yo male with APML and now with hospital course complicated by
   pulmonary embolism, alveolar hemorrhage and now with evidence of
   progressive left sided pulmonary infiltrates and persistent hypoxemia
   despite broad spectrum antibiotic therapy.  This remains most likely a
   bacterial pathogen and would expect improvement with current broad
   spectrum antibiotics, however, improvement has been slow to date.  For
   reasons that might contribute to persistent failure--alternative
   fungal, PCP may be most likely infectious sources.  An organizing
   pneumonitis is certainly possible in this setting but would not want to
   consider empiric steroid Rx in the setting of more likely ongoing
   bacterial infection.  Have discussed at length the possible role  or
   bronchoscopy and BAL which would be pursued if intubated but given
   concern for low yield in the setting of ongoing antibiotics and
   inability to inform as to invasive fungal infection or organizing
   pneumonitis would not intubate specifically for the procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and pulmonary infiltrates. The patient has had a hospital course complicated by pulmonary embolism and alveolar hemorrhage. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition has shown slow improvement. The possible causes of persistent hypoxemia include bacterial infection, fungal infection, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), or organizing pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 244 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 244, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals persistent left-sided consolidations with some clearing at the left base. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, and consideration is being given to ambulation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's persistent hypoxemia and respiratory distress indicate a risk of respiratory compromise. Continued treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary, and the patient may require further respiratory support if the condition worsens.
2. Infection: The patient's history of APML and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of infection. Bacterial and fungal infections, including PCP, need to be considered, and appropriate diagnostic"
