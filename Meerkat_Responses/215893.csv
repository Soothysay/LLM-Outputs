   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and recent initiation
   of HD for ATN related renal failure, admitted with productive cough,
   leukocytosis, new transaminitis and relative hypotension, transferred
   to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant. He has been
   somnolent and AAOx2 throughout his stay and no prior ABG had been
   done.  At this time, per report, he appears to be at his baseline, so
   it is possible that this is his baseline. He has new liver failure and
   ESRD so it is possible that he is unable to clear his long acting
   narcotics causing him to be sedated with apneic episodes.  He is
   refusing BiPAP and it is unlikely that this will improve his
   hypercarbia give his intermittent apneic episodes when he falls asleep.
   No flap, HD did not improve AMS so not likely uremia.  LP for
   somnolence and AMS during last admission was negative.
   - Can attempt narcan to see if he becomes more awake and corrects his
   [**Last Name (LF) 8485**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] hold for now.
   - Will hold supplemental O2 given retained Co2
   - Serial ABGs to assess for worsening hypercarbia
   - Will consider intubation and attempt to correct hypercarbia,
   acidosis.
   - Head CT to assess for bleed, hold for now until more stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Hypotension: Appears to have improving pna on CXR, has
   some atelectasis at lung basees on Ct abd/pelivs.  Still has some
   infiltrate on exam.  Also on the differential would be biliary or
   abdominal source, though other than fluid filled loops of bowel, no
   obvious infection on CT.  Also has a history of CCY so not
   cholecystitis.  Not an obstructive picture.  Lactate within normal
   limits.  On exam, tunneled line non-tender and clean appearing.
   - ABx coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for now presumtive treatment of
   pneumonia with potential hospital associated organisms given relative
   hypotension.  This will also cover any potential intraabdominal /
   biliary source.
   - Send sputum for cx if possible
   - Follow up cultures
   - Fluid boluses to maintain MAP >65, has been hypotensive to the 80s
   per report during HD sessions
   - Check urine legionella antigen
   - Induced sputum for PCP
   .
   # HIV: HAART therapy on hold since [**Month (only) 1088**], trial of Pendamidine for
   PCP prophylaxis during last hospitalization not well tolerated by
   patient. Last CD 4 count 132 on [**2166-4-1**].
   - ID consult in AM re: HAART therapy and hypotension in the setting of
   immunocompromise, will also let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 377**] know he's here
   .
   # Transaminitis: Unclear etiology, patient denies abdominal pain and
   abdominal CT scan with no clear abnormalities of the biliary system.
   Potential etiologies of LFT abnormalities include hypotension
   related/shock liver, worsening Hep C, or other infectious hepatitis,
   drug/toxin related hepatitis.  Appears to be improving with hydration.
   Tylenol level, etoh, tox screens negative
   - F/U Hep A IgM and Hep C Viral load; HepBsAg and HepBsAb recently
   negative on [**2166-3-18**], HbcAb positive
   - Trend LFTs, consider further imaging such as ultrasound w/dopplers if
   transaminases continue to worsen
   - Continue to give IVF
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: New this admission, last platelet count 250 on [**3-25**]
   on day of discharge. DDx includes worsening HIV related
   thrombocytopenia, medication related given recent course of ABx though
   this is less likely, or some other hematologic process such as TTP
   given relative associated anemia, though no schistocytes on peripheral
   smear.   Intermediate pretest probability that this is presentation of
   HIT (5 points on 4T screen) given his recent heparin exposure in last
   hospitalization, >50% platelet drop, 5-10 days since last heparin
   exposure.
   - LDH 293/Hapto 125/Bili 0.3
   - Holding all heparin products for now
   - Continue argatroban for now
   - DIC labs, smear has no schistocytes
   - Follow up HIT ab - still pending
   - Consider heme consult
   .
   # Anemia: Hct lower than most recent Hct on dischage, though within
   range of patient's previous Hct values.  Was normocytic on admission,
   now microcytic. Iron down from 98 to 11
   - Trend Hct daily
   - Guaiac stools
   - Holding on PRBC transfusion for now, but consider if Hct <25 given
   hypotension
   - Iron supplementation
   .
   # Hepatitis C
   - f/u HC viral load as above
   # Chronic Renal Failure
   - Continue HD as scheduled
   - Continue Calcium acetate, sevelamer per home dosing
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue Albuterol/Atrovent nebs
   .
   # Chronic Pain
   - Holding narcotics given somnolence
   - No tylenol given LFT abnormalities
   - Continue to follow, will likely need to add back at lower doses when
   patient stabilizes
   .
   # FEN
   - IVF for now, replete lytes, holding on diet given somnolence and
   likelihood of aspiration
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and recent initiation of hemodialysis (HD) for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) related renal failure. He was admitted with a productive cough, leukocytosis, new transaminitis, and relative hypotension, and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia may be due to various factors such as sedation from narcotics, refusal of BiPAP, intermittent apneic episodes during sleep, or uremia. Serial ABGs should be done to assess for worsening hypercarbia, and intubation may be considered to correct hypercarbia and acidosis.

2. Leukocytosis/hypotension: The patient has leukocytosis and relative hypotension, which may indicate an infection, particularly pneumonia. ABx coverage with Vanc/Zosyn is being provided for presumed hospital-associated pneumonia. Further investigations like sputum culture and follow-up cultures are planned.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new-onset thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 35 K/uL. Possible causes include worsening HIV-related thrombocytopenia, medication-related effects,"

 upper respiratory secretions
   CT head, non-contrast: 1. No evidence of space-occupying lesion within
   the brain. 2. Fluid opacification of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally,
   right greater than left. Aerosolized secretions in the right maxillary
   sinus could suggest a component of acute sinusitis. 3. Calcifications
   in the right globe. Correlate clinically, with history of prior trauma
   or infection, particularly cytomegalovirus infection given the
   patient's HIV status.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and recent initiation
   of HD for ATN related renal failure, admitted with productive cough,
   leukocytosis, new transaminitis and relative hypotension, transferred
   to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved.  Original precipitant
   unclear, though perhaps a combination of opiates, uremia, hypotension,
   and underlying cause of AMS. MS somewhat improved since arrival, though
   still altered from his baseline.  Still acidotic, but pH and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with a productive cough, leukocytosis, new transaminitis, and relative hypotension. The patient was transferred to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved. Original precipitant unclear, though perhaps a combination of opiates, uremia, hypotension, and underlying cause of AMS. MS somewhat improved since arrival, though still altered from his baseline. Still acidotic, but pH and hypercarbia improved. Patient has received no opiates since arriving to the MICU. Will defer narcan for now. Infection is in the differential, though no clear source at present.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo male with HIV, Hep C--admitted wtih altered mental status and
   concern for multiple potential sources as contributors with narcotic
   impact considered most likely at initial admission but has been slow to
   clear to date.  We appreciate ID input initially suggesting further
   exploration of possible CNS infection and initial head CT showing
   chronic changes.  This has been confounded by persistent hypotension
   despite IVF given and patient had CVL placed and substantial improvment
   in BP overnight.
 HYPOTENSION-
   -Substantial improvement with IVF given
with exploration of home
   history
patient with substantial time of poor po intake and clearly
   hypovolemic now improved with IVF at 7 liters
   -Continue to keep I/O even
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)-_Source of this is
   multifactorial.  He has old trauma suggested and we have persistent
   renal failure, residual medication effects, possible crypto CNS
   infection as leading possibilities.  He does have LP one week ago with
   negative Crypto and negative serum antigen and some improvement
   although remains with impaired sensorium and persistent confusion.
   -Will continue to attempt to normalize INR
   -Will discuss LP with ID
   -Improvement is likely related to improved ventilation and decreased
   CO2, increased MSO4 metabolism, stabilization of BP with volume
   replacement from this multifactorial source of encephaoloapthy.
   HIV-
   -Hold HAART
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   -Improved with decreased sedation
   -Decrease FIO2 as tolerated
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA-
   -HIT negative
   -Follow counts
   -[**Month (only) 60**] be related to HIV/HEP c disease with acute change in the setting
   of 7 liters of IVF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HIV and Hepatitis C who was admitted with altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complex and multifactorial, with potential sources contributing to the altered mental status including narcotic impact, possible CNS infection, chronic changes on head CT, persistent renal failure, residual medication effects, and hypovolemia.

The patient has shown some improvement in terms of hypotension after receiving IV fluids and having a central venous line placed. However, the altered mental status persists and is attributed to multiple factors such as old trauma, persistent renal failure, residual medication effects, possible crypto CNS infection, and impaired sensorium.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved with decreased sedation and decreased FiO2 as tolerated. Thrombocytopenia is being monitored, and it is likely related to HIV/Hep C disease with acute change in the setting of receiving 7 liters of IV fluids.

The patient's care plan includes holding HAART for HIV, improving ventilation and decreasing CO2 levels, stabilizing blood pressure with volume replacement, and discussing lumbar puncture with the infectious disease team. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with [primary diagnosis].
- The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem and fluconazole.
- Blood cultures were sent from the central line and peripheral site.
- There is ongoing discussion regarding the need for a lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for central nervous system infections, specifically due to concerns about Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).
- Renal function was corrected, and hemodialysis (HD) was held due to concerns that uremia may not be contributing to altered mental status (AMS).
- Quantitative G6PD level was mildly elevated at 13.6.
- Induced sputum samples were collected and resent due to previous inconclusive results.
- The patient has allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature range of 36.7-37.2°C, heart rate between 71-82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/57 to 67 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's weight is 51 kg, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 3,291 mL and output of 2,180 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,111 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [**Male First Name (un) 3957**] with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's blood cultures were sent on [**2166-4-3**] 12:00 PM. There is ongoing discussion regarding whether to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) due to the suspicion of central nervous system infection. The patient's renal function is being corrected, and hemodialysis (HD) is being held because uremia is not contributing to altered mental status. The patient's quantitative G6PD level is mildly elevated at 13.6. The patient's sputum culture was resent because induced sputum from upper respiratory secretions was collected again.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fever could indicate an underlying infection, such as meningitis or sepsis. The discussion about performing a lumbar puncture suggests concern for a central nervous system infection. Blood cultures have been sent, but the results are pending.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, which can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory distress.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient has volume depletion without shock, which can lead to hypotension and inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires respiratory support with a nasal cannula, and their ABG results indicate respiratory failure. The cause"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and recent initiation
   of HD for ATN related renal failure, admitted with productive cough,
   leukocytosis, new transaminitis and relative hypotension, transferred
   to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved.  Original precipitant
   unclear, though perhaps a combination of opiates, uremia, hypotension,
   and underlying cause of AMS. MS somewhat improved since arrival, though
   still altered from his baseline.  Still acidotic, but pH and
   hypercarbia improved.  Patient has received no opiates since arriving
   to the MICU.  Will defer narcan for now.  Infection is in the
   differential, though no clear source at present.  Patient had a
   negative LP on [**3-21**] during his last hospitalization and negative serum
   cryptococcal antigen from yesterday, making CNS infection seem less
   likely.  Head CT also negative.
   - on fluconazole, meropenem, & vancomycin per ID recs; infectious w/u
   as below
   - will discuss ?LP with patient
s ID physician
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] will minimize supplemental O2 given retained CO2
   - cont. to hold narcotics
   - Serial ABGs to assess for worsening hypercarbia
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Etiology unclear with broad differential:
   medication vs. metabolic vs. infectious.
   - Drug: holding narcotics, though doubt this is the cause as the
   patient has chronically been on narcotics
   - Metabolic: patient likely has a chronic respiratory acidosis in the
   setting of COPD, but baseline unclear
   - ID: repeat sputum, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 377**], LP not likely to be positive with
   recent negative (1 wk PTA)
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Hypotension: Hypotension resolved after aggressive IV
   fluid resuscitation overnight.  No longer requiring pressors.
   Leukocytosis is also much improved, though some of the decrease may be
   dilution.  CXR appears to have improving PNA.  Also on the differential
   would be biliary or abdominal source, though other than fluid filled
   loops of bowel, no obvious infection on CT.  Also has a history of CCY
   so not cholecystitis.  Not an obstructive picture.  Lactate within
   normal limits.  On exam, tunneled line non-tender and clean appearing.
   - ABx coverage with Vanc/Meropenem for presumptive treatment of
   pneumonia with potential hospital associated organisms given relative
   hypotension.  This will also cover any potential intraabdominal /
   biliary source.
   - On fluconazole for possible Cryptococcus, though seems less likely
   now given serum Ag negative and neg CSF 12 days prior
   - F/u induced sputum for cx, per PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Follow up cultures
   - Fluid boluses to maintain MAP >65,
   - Stool for C. diff pending
   .
   # HIV: HAART therapy on hold since [**Month (only) 1088**], trial of Pendamidine for
   PCP prophylaxis during last hospitalization not well tolerated by
   patient. Last CD 4 count 132 on [**2166-4-1**].
   - f/u ID recs, their assistance appreciated
   .
   # Transaminitis: Much improved.  Unclear etiology
 dehydration vs.
   hypotension vs. worsening HCV vs. drug/toxin, though the later two seem
   less likely.  Denies abdominal pain and abdominal CT scan with no clear
   abnormalities of the biliary system. Tylenol level, etoh, tox screens
   negative.  HCV viral load not significantly elevated from [**2162**] (last
   measured level); HAV IgM neg. HepBsAg and HepBsAb recently negative on
   [**2166-3-18**].
   - Trend LFTs, consider further imaging such as ultrasound w/ dopplers
   if transaminases continue to worsen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. New this admission, last platelet count 250
   on [**3-25**] on day of discharge. DDx includes worsening HIV related
   thrombocytopenia, medication related given recent course of ABx though
   this is less likely, or some other hematologic process such as TTP
   given relative associated anemia, though no schistocytes on peripheral
   smear.   HIT Ab negative.  Platelets down again today, but may be
   related to IVF.  Will continue to trend
   - Holding sc heparin for now
   .
   # Anemia: Stable. Hct lower than most recent Hct on dischage, though
   within range of patient's previous Hct values.  Was normocytic on
   admission, now microcytic. Iron down from 98 to 11
   - Trend Hct daily
   - Guaiac stools
   - Holding on PRBC transfusion for now, but consider if Hct <25 and
   hypotensive
   - Iron supplementation

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and recent initiation of HD for ATN-related renal failure. He was admitted with a productive cough, leukocytosis, new transaminitis, and relative hypotension. He is currently in the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's original precipitant is unclear, but it may be due to a combination of opiates, uremia, hypotension, and underlying cause of altered mental status (AMS). There is improvement in hypercarbic respiratory failure since arrival in the MICU, but the patient is still altered from his baseline.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The etiology of AMS is unclear with a broad differential including medication, metabolic, or infectious causes. Drug-induced AMS is less likely since narcotics have been withheld. Metabolic causes could be related to chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of COPD, but the baseline is unclear. Infectious causes are less likely due to negative sputum culture and serum cryptococcal antigen.

3. Leukocytosis/Hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved after aggressive IV fluid resuscitation overnight. Leukocytosis has also improved, although some of the decrease may be due to dilution. The patient's CXR appears to show improving pneumonia. Other potential sources of"

   leukocytosis, new transaminitis and relative hypotension, transferred
   to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Improved.  Original precipitant
   unclear, though perhaps a combination of opiates, uremia, hypotension,
   and underlying cause of AMS. MS somewhat improved since arrival, though
   still altered from his baseline.  Still acidotic, but pH and
   hypercarbia improved.  Patient has received no opiates since arriving
   to the MICU.  Will defer narcan for now.  Infection is in the
   differential, though no clear source at present.  Patient had a
   negative LP on [**3-21**] during his last hospitalization and negative serum
   cryptococcal antigen from yesterday, making CNS infection seem less
   likely.  Head CT also negative.
   - on fluconazole, meropenem, & vancomycin per ID recs; infectious w/u

   # Altered Mental Status: Etiology unclear with broad differential:
   medication vs. metabolic vs. infectious.
   - Drug: holding narcotics, though doubt this is the cause as the
   patient has chronically been on narcotics
   - Metabolic: patient likely has a chronic respiratory acidosis in the
   setting of COPD, but baseline unclear
   - ID: repeat sputum, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 377**], LP not likely to be positive with
   recent negative (1 wk PTA)

   # Leukocytosis/Hypotension: Hypotension resolved after aggressive IV
   fluid resuscitation overnight.  No longer requiring pressors.
   Leukocytosis is also much improved, though some of the decrease may be
   dilution.  CXR appears to have improving PNA.  Also on the differential
   would be biliary or abdominal source, though other than fluid filled
   loops of bowel, no obvious infection on CT.  Also has a history of CCY
   so not cholecystitis.  Not an obstructive picture.  Lactate within
   normal limits.  On exam, tunneled line non-tender and clean appearing.
   - ABx coverage with Vanc/Meropenem for presumptive treatment of
   pneumonia with potential hospital associated organisms given relative
   hypotension.  This will also cover any potential intraabdominal /

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV, and recent initiation of hemodialysis (HD) for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) related renal failure. The patient was admitted with a productive cough, leukocytosis, new transaminitis, and relative hypotension. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved since arrival in the MICU. The original precipitant is unclear, but it could be a combination of opiates, uremia, hypotension, and an underlying cause of altered mental status (AMS). The patient has received no opiates since arriving at the MICU.
2. Altered mental status: The etiology of AMS is unclear with a broad differential including medication, metabolic, or infectious causes. Drug-induced AMS is less likely since the patient has chronically been on narcotics. Metabolic causes may be related to chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the baseline is unclear. Infectious causes are less likely given recent negative lumbar puncture (LP) and serum cryptococcal antigen. The patient is on fluconazole, meropenem, and vancomycin as per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations.
3. Leukocytosis/hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved after aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation overnight. Leukocytosis has also improved, though some of the decrease may be due to dilution. The chest X-ray appears to show improving pneumonia. Other potential sources of infection, such as biliary or abdominal sources, are considered, but there are no obvious signs of infection on the CT scan. The patient's lactate levels are within normal limits. A tunneled line is non-tender and clean appearing. Antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Meropenem is provided for presumptive treatment of pneumonia with potential hospital-associated organisms given the relative hypotension. This will also cover any potential intraabdominal/biliary source.
4. HIV: HAART therapy is on hold since [Month] 1088, and a trial of Pentamidine for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis during the last hospitalization was not well tolerated by the patient. The last CD4 count was 132 on [Date].
5. Transaminitis: The cause of transaminitis is unclear, with possibilities including dehydration, hypotension, worsening Hepatitis C, or drug/toxin exposure. However, these latter two causes seem less likely. Tylenol level, etoh, tox screens were negative. Hepatitis C viral load is not significantly elevated from [Date]. Hepatitis A IgM is negative, and Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody were recently negative on [Date]. Further imaging such as ultrasound with dopplers may be considered if transaminases continue to worsen.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 250 on [Date]. The differential diagnosis includes worsening HIV-related thrombocytopenia, medication-related causes, or other hematologic processes such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient has negative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies. Platelets are down again today, but may be related to intravenous fluids. Trending platelets and considering further evaluation for causes of thrombocytopenia is recommended.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable with a lower hematocrit (Hct) than the most recent Hct on discharge, though within the range of previous Hct values. The anemia was initially normocytic but has become microcytic. Iron levels have decreased from 98 to 11. Daily trending of Hct and further evaluation are recommended.
8. Hepatitis C: The patient's Hepatitis C viral load is 548,000.
9. Chronic renal failure: The patient continues on hemodialysis (HD) as scheduled. Calcium acetate and sevelamer are continued per home dosing.
10. COPD: The patient's COPD management includes continuing albuterol/atrovent nebs.
11. Chronic pain: The patient's narcotics are being held due to somnolence. No tylenol is given due to liver function test abnormalities. When the patient stabilizes, lower doses of narcotics may need to be added back.
12. Fluid and electrolyte management: The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and will continue to receive intravenous fluids as needed. Lytes will be repleted prn.
13. Access: The patient has peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, a tunneled line, and an arterial line.
14. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots are applied to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure due to underlying COPD or other lung pathology.
2. Development of new infections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or bloodstream infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo male with HIV/HCV and now admit wtih altered mental status in the
   setting of  MSO4 dosing and impaired ventilation and associated
   hypercarbia.  He, in this immune suppressed state, certainly has a
   broad differential for possible sources.  Encouraging is that he has
   shown some improvment in sensorium with possible multifactorial sources
   of encephaoloapthy including hypercarbia, medication effects, renal
   failure, hypernatremia all conspiring and all have shown modest
   improvement with renal failure managed by dialysis.
   1)Altered Mental Status-For treatment for possible sources, by issue,
   will-->
   A)Infection-no clear focal source identified but possible pneumonia
   -Vanco/Meropenem
   -Fluconazole
   -Will defer to ID on final recs for LP in the setting of clinical
   improvement but are moving INR to normal
   B)Renal Failure-
   -Dialysis to continue and likely for Saturday
   C)Medication Effects-
   -Minimize narcotic dosing going forward
   -Avoid sedating medications
   D)Respiratory Failure-
   -Minimize sedating medications
   -Follow exam
   -Bronchodilators to continue
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with HIV and HCV, presenting with altered mental status. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure of 126/67 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue and diminished breath sounds bilaterally. His extremities show trace edema. Neurologically, he follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but has not been assessed for movement or tone. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 32 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 35 K/uL. Blood cultures were sent on 04-03-2166 at 12:00 PM. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by an elevated creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 23.7 mL/min. His electrolytes show hypernatremia (Na+: 146 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K+: 2.7 mEq"
