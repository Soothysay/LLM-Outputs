   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's history includes laryngeal cancer, tracheostomy placement elsewhere, COPD, CAD, and DM. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Key findings from the progress note include hypoventilation, hypoxemia, fevers, and eventual respiratory failure. The tracheostomy site was occluded due to granulation tissue and the orifice was abutting the tracheal wall. This was improved with repositioning of the tracheostomy.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy twice during the 24-hour period, had an arterial line placed, and a urine culture was obtained. The patient is receiving propofol for sedation, lorazepam for agitation, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory issues mentioned earlier.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 497 K/uL, blood glucose level of 344 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and a slightly elevated lactate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of laryngeal cancer, tracheostomy placement elsewhere, COPD, CAD, and DM. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, no distress, and no wheezes. The patient's recent events include bronchoscopies, arterial line placement, and urine culture. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine level, and normal troponin-T level. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 475, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 26. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Imaging shows a hiatal hernia and clear lung bases on CT scan, while the chest X-ray does not show any obvious infiltrates.

   # Respiratory failure.  Initially described to have seemingly
   hypoventilatory failure with low respiratory rate; in ED patient with
   increased respiratory effort but distressed.  Differential initially
   included COPD exacerbation or other cause of acute bronchospasm
   (allergic reaction/anaphylaxis from ?CT contrast), pneumonia (no
   infiltrate on CXR), mucous plugging, ACS or CHF exacerbation (elevated
   BNP with small increase in troponin).  After bronch appeared to be
   related to airway edema and obstruction..
   - IP replaced trach yesterday, now on trach mask and doing well
   - Unclear if infection playing a role, will repeat CXR, follow up and
   decide whether to treat PNA v. bronchitis v. nothing; did have low
   grade fever yesterday with a rising leukocytosis (although is in
   setting of steroid treatment)
   -Continue steroid taper for inflammation per IP recs.
   - prn bronchodilators and benadryl to decrease airway edema.
   .
   # Leukocytosis and fever.  T 103 at arrival to OSH.  With bandemia at
   OSH; here with neutrophil predominence without bands.  Now also on
   steroids.  CT abd without evidence of source.
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures (endotracheal).  Consider C.diff if
   diarrhea.
   - Levofloxacin for COPD flare; now, will follow up CXR and decide on
   treatment.
   .
   # Laryngeal cancer.  s/p trach with difficulting passing bronchoscopy
   through cords.
   - steroids/benadryl as above.
   - f/u with OSH oncologist v. ENT doctor
   - OSH records re: treatment plans and history.
   .
   # Elevated troponin.  No chest pain or concerning ECG findings, ?demand
   in setting of hypoxia/acute respiratory failure.
   - Repeat ECG in AM - normal
   - Trend troponins
 going down, again likely in setting of demand
   - Daily ASA reasonable (got today); hold off on further meds for ACS
   unless more clear evidence of cardiac ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type II diabetes. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The initial assessment included potential causes such as COPD exacerbation, allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, pneumonia, mucous plugging, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. After further evaluation, airway edema and obstruction were identified as the primary issue.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management of the mechanical ventilation settings to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, suggesting a possible infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered to identify the causative organism. Levofloxacin has been started for a suspected COPD flare, but further treatment decisions will depend on follow-up chest X-ray results.

3. Laryngeal Cancer Progression: The patient's history of laryngeal cancer with recent tracheostomy placement may lead to complications such as difficulty passing a bronchoscope through the cords. Steroids and benadryl are being used to reduce airway edema.

4. Elevated Troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, which could indicate myocardial"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with history of laryngeal cancer, s/p recent trach, COPD; admit
   with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Initially described to have seemingly
   hypoventilatory failure with low respiratory rate; in ED patient with
   increased respiratory effort but distressed.  Differential initially
   included COPD exacerbation or other cause of acute bronchospasm
   (allergic reaction/anaphylaxis from ?CT contrast), pneumonia (no
   infiltrate on CXR), mucous plugging, ACS or CHF exacerbation (elevated
   BNP with small increase in troponin), oversedation/hypoventilation (a
   possibility initially when having low respiratory rates, less of a
   possibilty now).  However, now seeming to be more of an airway/trach
   problem - bronch in ICU with granulation tissue overlaying end of trach
   causing ?obstruction.
   - Needs replacement of trach - OR vs. ICU tomorrow.  IP saw this
   evening and will follow.
   - Maintain on vent overnight with sedation: CPAP vs. AC depending on
   tolerance.
   - Bolus sedation prn - propofol gtt.  Keep sedated to minimize
   agitation and obstruction until replacement of trach tomorrow.
   - Treat for COPD exacerbation with Solumedrol 125 Q8H overnight; change
   to 60 PO prednisone in AM if does well.  Levofloxacin 750 daily x 5
   days given severe exacerbation requiring mech vent.
   - Given evidence of mild volume overload (elevated BNP and some fluid
   on CXR) will likely need IV lasix at some point; holding off for now as
   not primary issue and patient with tenuous status.
   - ATC and prn bronchodilators and benadryl to decrease airway edema.
   - Consider inhaled or subQ epi if appears to have anaphylaxis.
   - Place A line tonight.
   .
   # Leukocytosis and fever.  T 103 at arrival to OSH.  With bandemia at
   OSH; here with neutrophil predominence without bands.  Now also on
   steroids.  CT abd without evidence of source.
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures (endotracheal).  Consider C.diff if
   diarrhea.
   - Levofloxacin for COPD flare; can tailor therapy if sputum cx positive
   or not clinically responding.  Hold pseudomonal coverage for now given
   lack of previous culture data and overall hemodynamic stability.
   Broaden if decompensates.
   .
   # Laryngeal cancer.  s/p trach with difficulting passing bronchoscopy
   through cords.
   - steroids/benadryl as above.
   - ?ENT consult.
   - OSH records re: treatment plans and history.
   .
   # Elevated troponin.  No chest pain or concerning ECG findings, ?demand
   in setting of hypoxia/acute respiratory failure.
   - Repeat ECG in AM.
   - Trend troponins.
   - Daily ASA reasonable (got today); hold off on further meds for ACS
   unless more clear evidence of cardiac ischemia.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 20.  Lactate 2, does have ketones on UA.
   Creatinine 1.2 with unclear baseline but may have ARF component
   contributing.
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
   - Insulin to control blood glucose and ketonemia.
   .
   # Diabetes type II.
   - Insulin sliding scale with QID FSG.
   .
   # Anxiety.
   - Propofol gtt to keep relatively comfortable while optimizing
   pulmonary status overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer, status post recent tracheostomy (trach), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- The patient was admitted with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
- Initial assessment suggested hypoventilatory failure, but now seems to be an airway/trach problem due to bronchial obstruction caused by granulation tissue.
- Replacement of tracheostomy tube is needed, either in the operating room or in the ICU tomorrow.
- The patient will be maintained on ventilation overnight with sedation using CPAP or AC mode depending on tolerance.
- Propofol gtt will be given for bolus sedation as needed to minimize agitation and obstruction until the tracheostomy tube is replaced.
- Treatment for COPD exacerbation includes Solumedrol 125 Q8H overnight and changing to 60 PO prednisone in the morning if the patient does well.
- Levofloxacin 750 daily x 5 days is given due to severe exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation.
- Mild volume overload is present, so IV lasix may be required at some point, but it is being held off for now.
- ATC and prn bronchodilators, as well as Benadryl, will be given to decrease airway edema.
- Inhaled or subQ epi may be considered if anaphylaxis is suspected"
