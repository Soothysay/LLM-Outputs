","Summary:
The patient underwent amputation of the 2nd and 3rd toes on the right foot in the operating room. Vascular surgery was consulted, and a plan is in place for either a toe-to-hand transfer or below-knee amputation after the wound has further drained. The patient remains on an insulin drip due to the possibility of returning to the operating room. This morning, the patient is without complaints but experiences pins and needles in the right foot, although there is no pain. The patient's daughters are at her bedside. 

Allergies are noted, as well as recent doses of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications. There are no changes to the medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new symptom of pins and needles in the right foot. 

Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/45 mmHg to 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a stable fluid balance. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, with clear oropharynx and no scleral icterus. Lung sounds are clear, and there is no evidence of edema or cyanosis in the extremities. Neurological examination shows that the patient is oriented to time, place, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient underwent an amputation of the 2nd and 3rd toes on the right foot. Vascular surgery consulted and plans for a possible below-knee amputation after the wound has further drained. The patient remained on an insulin drip due to the possibility of returning to the operating room. This morning, the patient was without complaints but experienced some pins and needles sensation in the right foot. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/45 to 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with a warm extremity and no edema or cyanosis. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count could indicate an ongoing or developing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and daily lab results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The elevated glucose level may suggest uncontrolled diabetes, which could lead to DKA. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and acid-base balance is crucial.
3. Bleeding: The patient received blood products during their stay in the ICU. Monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure, and regular assessment of the surgical site for any signs"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 80 yo female w/h/o DM2 and medical noncompliance who is
   admitted with hyperglycemia and right foot cellulitis, right second toe
   osteomyelitis.
   # Right second toe osteomyelitis/right foot cellulitis: Patient has had
   some systemic symptoms that could be related to insidious infection,
   such as mild fatigue and decreased appetite (also could be [**12-25**] to
   uncontrolled DM). No evidence of SIRS at this time. Hemodynamically
   stable. Lactate 1.6. WBCs trending down from over 30. Blood cx from OSH
   this AM positive for strep 2 of 2 bottles. Suspect that patient
s foot
   is obvious source, but unclear how long this could have been seeding
   bloodstream, so potential for other sites of infection as well.
   - f/u OSH cx (sensitivies and further speciation)
   - Blood cx pending, deep tissue cx data pending (podiatry send this
   from OR)
   - Appreciate podiatry and vascular surgery assistance (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   team, vascular team A)
   - Trend WBCs
   - Continue vanc/zosyn pending further speciation and sensitivities of
   culture data
   - PICC for long term antibiotics (will likely obtain tomorrow)
   - TTE to evaluate for endocarditis, surveillance cultures
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient
s presentation fits more with DKA (ketones in
   urine, gap, not markedly hyperosmolar state). She was initially
   confused and had large AG. Her gap has closed and she is currently
   oriented x 3. Given history of non-compliance, will need to further
   delineate social network and patient
s ability to care for herself. She
   is also in need of a great deal of teaching regarding her diabetes
   mellitus. She appears to have neuropathy, and may have some retinopathy
   given history of blurry vision.
   - continue insulin gtt, will transition to lantus with short acting for
   meals/correction and uptitrate lantus as needed based on short acting
   needs.
   - Will switch over to NS given gap has closed, still w/poor PO intake.
   - treat infection as above
   - [**Last Name (un) 72**] consult
   - Hb A1c pending.
   - SW consult for assistance with further evaluating social needs
   # ARF: Resolved, suspect was [**12-25**] to relative hypovolemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and medical noncompliance. She was admitted with hyperglycemia and right foot cellulitis, including osteomyelitis of the right second toe. The patient had systemic symptoms that could be related to an insidious infection, such as mild fatigue and decreased appetite, which could also be attributed to uncontrolled diabetes. She is hemodynamically stable with a lactate level of 1.6 and a WBC count trending down from over 30. Blood culture results from outside the hospital were positive for strep, suggesting that the patient's foot is likely the source of infection, although it is unclear how long it has been seeding the bloodstream. There is a potential for other sites of infection as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection in the foot and the possibility of bloodstream involvement, there is a risk of sepsis developing.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's hyperglycemia presentation fits more with DKA, her current orientation and lack of markedly hyperosmolar state suggest otherwise. However, close monitoring of blood glucose levels and acid-base balance is necessary.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's history of diabetes and current infection make her susceptible to endocarditis, especially if the infecting organism is viridans group streptococci. A transthor"

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who presented with a diabetic foot infection complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She underwent left toe amputation and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/56 mmHg to 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, white blood cell count of 22.8 K/uL, platelet count of 324 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 27 mg/dL, calcium level of 7.4 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.4 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 2.2 mg/dL. The patient has been receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the resolution of DKA/HNK. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics for her foot infection, and her OR cultures are pending. The plan is to transfer her to the floor once she is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulceration, and potential recurrence of DKA if insulin therapy is not managed appropriately. Regular monitoring of vital signs, blood glucose levels, and laboratory parameters will be necessary to prevent and promptly address any potential complications."
