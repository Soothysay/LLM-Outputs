","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, currently admitted to the ICU for severe headaches, diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. He has been receiving daily lumbar punctures for elevated intracranial pressure. The patient's condition is complicated by hypokalemia, likely secondary to ambisome treatment. He has received a continuous IV KCl infusion but still shows no improvement in potassium levels. His magnesium levels are also low and need aggressive repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypokalemia: The patient's persistent low potassium levels pose a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory problems.
2. Cryptococcal Meningitis: Although the patient's symptoms have improved, there is still a risk of neurological complications such as seizures or further decline in mental status if the infection does not fully resolve.
3. Hypomagnesemia: Low magnesium levels can contribute to muscle cramps, tremors, and abnormal heart rhythms.
4. Dysphagia: The patient's ongoing difficulty swallowing pills increases the risk of aspiration and potential respiratory complications.
5. Depression: The patient's depression could impact his overall well-being and recovery.
6. Tobacco abuse: Continued nicotine use can exacerbate respiratory issues and hinder the healing process.
7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte levels is crucial to avoid further complications.
8. Infection control: Proper isolation precautions should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, admitted to the ICU for severe headaches and diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. He has been receiving daily lumbar punctures for elevated intracranial pressure and treatment with Ambisome. The patient also has refractory hypokalemia due to urinary potassium loss secondary to Ambisome, for which he is being repleted with continuous IV potassium chloride. Additionally, he has hypomagnesemia, which is being aggressively repleted. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and vomiting have improved with medication adjustments. He is also being treated for cryptococcal meningitis, HIV, and hypomagnesemia. Other issues include depression, tobacco abuse, and a pending consultation for gastrointestinal problems. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia is likely to continue unless the underlying cause (urinary potassium loss secondary to Ambisome) is addressed. Continuous IV potassium chloride repletion may help in correcting the potassium levels.
2. Hypomagnesemia: Aggressive repletion of magnesium is necessary due to the patient's low magnesium levels. Frequent reassessment and redosing may be required to maintain adequate magnesium levels.
3. Cryptococcal Meningitis: Although the patient's symptoms have improved, there is a risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, currently admitted to the ICU for severe headaches and diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. The patient has been receiving daily lumbar punctures (LPs) for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). He is also experiencing refractory hypokalemia likely secondary to Ambisome treatment. The patient received KCl 60mEq overnight with no increase in potassium levels, then began receiving 80mEq in 1L, which helped normalize his potassium levels. The plan is to continue repletion as further losses are expected and avoid oral KCl due to significant nausea and gastrointestinal upset. 

The patient's magnesium levels are within normal limits. The plan is to recheck at 3 pm and replete as needed. 

Regarding the cryptococcal meningitis, the patient's headaches have resolved completely, and previous elevated opening pressures have stabilized. The last LP showed decreased pressure with elevated white blood cells but no organisms on gram stain or culture. The CSF crypto titer is >1:64, but this is expected as it may change in 2 weeks. The patient is clinically asymptomatic with a perfect clinical picture and no growth on cultures. 

The patient's HIV status shows a viral load (VL) of 100K and a CD4 count of 116, which is higher than expected for someone with cryptococcal meningitis.

","Summary:
The patient is still awake and alert, with no acute distress. They continue to walk around the unit. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, blood pressure within normal limits, heart rate slightly elevated but within normal range, respiratory rate normal, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for potassium levels. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 684 mL since midnight. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates normal heart rhythm. The patient has received potassium repletion and has a current potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L. Other lab results show within normal range or no significant abnormalities. The patient's extremities show 1+ edema. The neurologic examination is normal. The patient has a code status of full code and is being transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypokalemia: The patient's current potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L indicates hypokalemia. If not addressed, it may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory problems.
2. Negative Fluid Balance: The negative fluid balance of 684 mL since midnight suggests dehydration. This could potentially result in hypotension, increased heart rate, and compromised organ function if not managed appropriately.
3. Potential Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has 1+ edema in their extremities. Although not assessed for DVT, this finding warrants monitoring for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, currently admitted to the ICU with severe headache and diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. The patient has been undergoing daily lumbar punctures for elevated intracranial pressure. The patient now presents with refractory hypokalemia likely secondary to ambisome therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are:

1. Hypokalemia: The patient is experiencing urinary K+ loss due to ambisome therapy. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed with potassium repletion as further losses are expected. The patient is currently receiving K+ 40mEq/100ml IV q8hrs with a sliding scale.

2. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are within normal limits this morning. However, it is important to monitor and manage magnesium levels on a sliding scale.

3. Cryptococcal Meningitis: Although the patient's headaches have resolved completely, there is still a risk of complications associated with cryptococcal meningitis. The patient will continue with daily LPs for elevated ICP until November 10th. Repeat LP with opening pressure is planned on November 16th. The patient is currently on fluconazole 400mg IV q24h and flucytosine 1500mg PO q6 (day 11). It is important to follow LFTs and continue monitoring the"

      Patient credited. Minimum 14 day interval for repeat testing.
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2763**] @ 1524 ON [**2147-11-16**].
   Assessment and Plan
   44 year old male with h/o HIV, off HAART X3 months (last CD4 200s),
   admitted [**11-4**] with severe HAs X 5 days, found to have cryptococcal
   mennigitis, getting daily LPs for elevated ICP until [**11-10**]. Now with
   refractory hypokalemia likely secondary to ambisome.
   .
   # Hypokalemia: Urinary K+ loss secondary to ambisome. Patient on K+
   40mEq/100ml IV Q8hrs with sliding scale. Plan to continue repletion as
   further losses are expected. Also will avoid po KCl as this has give
   him significant nausea/GI upset. K+=4.3 today, which is within normal
   limits. Patient received final dose of Ambisome overnight. Will likely
   need K+ monitoring for 24 hours.
   - Appreciate Pharmacy input
   - Recheck Q12hrs
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypomagnesemia: Magnesium slightly elevated. On sliding scale.
   - Recheck Q12hrs.
   .
   # Cryptococcal Meningitis: Headaches have resolved completely. previous
   elevated opening pressures, now stablized. Last LP showed decreased
   pressure with elevated WBC but no organisms so far on gram stain or
   culture. The CSF crypto titer >1:64 but this is expected as it may
   change in 2 weeks. Patient is clinically asymptomatic with perfect
   clinical picture and no growth on cultures.  LP performed yesterday
   with opening pressure = 17.5 and closing pressure = 9. Labs sent per ID
   recs.
   - appreciate ID following patient.
   - cont flucytosine 1500mg PO q6 (day11), ambisone 400mg IV q24h (day
   14/14).  Received last dose of Ambisome.
   - cont toradol 30mg IV q8 ATC and dilaudid 2mg q3IV prn with bowel
   regimen, zofran and ativan q6 ATC and compazine prn
   .
   # HIV, previously on HAART, but off X 3 months [**3-4**] dysphagia/vomiting
   as well as noncompliance per OSH HIV doctor. No h/o AIDS defining
   illnesses until now.
   -VL 100K, CD4 count is 116, which is higher than expected for someone
   with crypo meningitis
   - treating crypto meningitis as above, will need flucon after
   - Cont. bactrim DS qd proph per ID
   -will defer to his outpt HIV MDs regarding restarting ART.
   .
   # Dysphagia X 3 months, intermittent, with liquids and solids/pills a/w
   pain (during episodes only) and vomiting. No odynophagia. s/p EGD and
   barium swallow 1 month ago, unremarkable. Mostly issues with swallowing
   pills.
   - has been tolerating some of oral meds here, main one is flucytosine.
   not tolerating bactrim (too big), ok with liquid formulation
   - hold on GI consult inpatient unless acute issue, he has GI f/u
   .
   # Depression: Continue seroquel 25 mg qhs.
   .
   # Tobacco abuse: Declining nicotine patch.
   .
   # FEN/proph: monitor lytes as above, gen diet as tolerated, TEDs/SCDs,
   no need for PPI, bowel regimen, will ask for PICC placement for easier
   access.
   .
   #Dispo/Code: Full code. Note, family not aware of diagnosis of HIV.
   Partner is aware. Likely D/C on Friday after last dose of ambisome.
   Transfer to floor today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, admitted with severe headaches and diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. The patient has undergone multiple lumbar punctures (LPs) due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Currently, the patient is experiencing refractory hypokalemia likely secondary to Ambisome treatment. 

The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's general appearance is described as well-nourished and not in acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and there are no murmurs detected. Peripheral pulses are not assessed, and respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion with clear breath sounds. Abdominal examination indicates a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities show positive edema in both legs. Neurologic examination is not performed.

Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels (K+ 20 mEq/L), decreased hemoglobin (Hct 30.3%), decreased platelet count (Plt 308), and slightly elevated magnesium levels (Mg++ 2.9 mg/dL). Cryptococcal antigen test is positive, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient has received the final dose of Ambisome overnight.

The patient's plan includes continuing potassium repletion due to expected further losses, avoiding potassium chloride as it causes significant nausea and gastrointestinal upset,"
