","The patient's chief complaint is mental status changes. The patient has a history of heavy alcohol use and presents with altered mental status, visual disturbances, ataxia, and a high TSH level. These symptoms are suggestive of a central rather than peripheral neurologic process. The differential diagnosis includes thiamine deficiency/Wernicke's encephalopathy, viral CNS infections, syphilis, thyroid disorders, subacute combined degeneration, Lyme disease, alcohol withdrawal, and [Last Name (un)]-[Location (un)].

The patient has been started on thiamine and folate repletion, close follow-up with the neuro service, and consideration of repeating MRA/MRV/MRI with more sedation. EEG and CSF cultures are pending. Acyclovir will be continued until HSV cultures are negative. TSH is high, B12 is normal, ammonia levels are high, likely due to [3-4] alcohol hepatitis. RPR is negative.

The patient's urine analysis shows signs of urinary tract infection (UTI), for which she has been prescribed antibiotics. She also requires close monitoring for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and has been started on lorazepam. IV fluids have been initiated due to tachycardia, possibly caused by dehydration, alcohol withdrawal, or thyroid disorder. The patient's electrolytes need to be repleted. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin has been administered, and peripheral lines have been placed. The patient's code status"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old female with chief complaint of mental status changes. The patient has a history of heavy alcohol use and presents with symptoms suggestive of a central rather than peripheral neurologic process. The high differential includes thiamine deficiency/Wernicke's encephalopathy, viral CNS infections, syphilis, thyroid disorders, subacute combined degeneration, Lyme disease, alcohol withdrawal, and other possibilities.

The patient has undergone several tests including EEG, EKG, transthoracic echo, lumbar puncture, and MRI. The results of these tests are pending except for the echo which showed a normal left atrium size, normal left ventricular wall thickness, normal left ventricular cavity size, and normal overall left ventricular systolic function. The right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were also normal. The aortic valve leaflets appeared structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appeared structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There was no pericardial effusion and the inferior vena cava was probably small consistent with low right atrial pressure. The CXR was unremarkable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 132/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%."

   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no pericardial effusion. The inferior vena cava is probably small
   (views suboptimal) consistent with low right atrial pressure.

   EEG: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to a slight
   slowing of the background rhythm. These findings suggest a mild
   encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal
   slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There
   were no clearly epilptiform features.

   Imaging: MRI/MRV: No neurovascular abnormality identified. No evidence

   EEG: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to a slight
   slowing of the background rhythm. These findings suggest a mild
   encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
   Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most
   common causes. Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal
   slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There
   were no clearly epilptiform features.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with an altered mental status. She had an episode of hallucination and psychosis after receiving Percocet, which responded well to 0.5mg of Haldol IV. The patient's CIWA scale was initially below 10 but increased to 19 during the hallucination. There is a history of hallucinations and paranoia with opioids in the past. The patient has no known drug allergies and was previously on acyclovir and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, tachycardia, and blood pressure within normal limits. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,970 mL with outputs of 2,440 mL through blood products, 1,370 mL through urine, and 350 mL as drain balance. The patient's lab results indicate a slightly low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and imaging studies show no abnormalities.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status likely due to thiamine deficiency caused by possible anorexia and alcohol abuse. Other potential causes such as viral CNS infections, syphilis, thyroid disorders, subacute combined degeneration, Lyme's disease, alcohol withdrawal, and anorexia nervosa are also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with thiamine deficiency. They have a history of heavy alcohol use and present with altered mental status, likely due to thiamine deficiency. The patient also has ineffective coping, altered mental status (not delirium), and a urinary tract infection (UTI). Other potential causes for the altered mental status include viral CNS infections, syphilis, thyroid disorders, subacute combined degeneration, Lyme's disease, alcohol withdrawal, and vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient is currently receiving thiamine and folate repletion, close follow-up with the neuro service, and treatment for the UTI with Bactrim. The patient's pain is being managed with Ultram, and they are also receiving IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte repletion. The patient's glycemic control is well-managed, and their code status is set to full code. They are planned for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening thiamine deficiency leading to further neurological impairment or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
2. Development of alcohol withdrawal symptoms due to cessation of heavy alcohol use.
3. Progression of the urinary tract infection (UTI) to a more severe infection such as pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
4. Complications related to the underlying medical conditions causing altered mental status, such as the progression of syphil"
