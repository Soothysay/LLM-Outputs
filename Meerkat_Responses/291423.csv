   heparin [**3-7**] recent vascular procedure.
   - tolerated well on decreasing sedation and paralytic.
   - had an episode of tachycardia, hypotension in the setting of nausea
   and vomiting.
   - preload dependent (critical AS and tachy), getting fluid resusitated.
   - fever to 103.6
 received Bcx, Ucx, sputum cx.
   - CT surgery did the trach, pt has impressive laryngeal edema, question
   if this can be addressed with prednisone burst, will need to follow up
   in CT surgery clinic.

   This is an 86 year old female with a hx of RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and
   symptomatic AS who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty, now
   s/p ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. HCT
   improved 10 points with 4 units, a relatively appropriate bump.   Hct
   down trended over the past 24 hours, likely [**3-7**] dilutional.
   - Ancef x 24 hours per vascular
   - F/U further vascular recs
   - HCT q6 for first 24 hours
   - T+S and 3 IVs in place
   - BP control with IV hydral PRN and pain control
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts. Received long acting paralytics during the procedure
   requiring longer term ventilation
   - Trach management per thoracics, consider steroids
   - Once no longer paralyzed, ween sedation and consider trial of trach
   mask
   .
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   .
   # Dilated stomach: Likely from extended ambu-bagging. Unable to pass
   NG/OGT. Will likely resolve on own.
   - Con't to monitor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). The patient initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now has a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair.

The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. These include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a positive DVT in one of the brachial veins and the left cephalic vein, which was detected through ultrasound (US). It is mentioned that the affected arm had a line prior, and heparin was not started yet.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 103.6째F, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Cultures were taken, including blood culture before starting antibiotics.

3. Tachycardia and Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia and hypotension in the setting of nausea and vomiting. The patient's blood pressure was managed with intravenous hydralazine (IV hydral PRN).

4. Preload-Dependent Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has critical AS, and any fluid resuscitation should be done carefully due to the preload-dependent nature of the condition. Fluid resuscitation is being closely monitored"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now post-ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm repair. The patient tolerated well on decreasing sedation and paralytic but had an episode of tachycardia, hypotension in the setting of nausea and vomiting. She was preload dependent and received fluid resuscitation. The patient also had a fever to 103.6, likely infectious etiology, given positive urine culture on 11/29 (GNR). She received broad-spectrum antibiotics and started on IV ciprofloxacin.

The patient underwent tracheostomy, which showed impressive laryngeal edema. It was planned to conduct steroid stress dose to reduce laryngeal swelling and prevent adrenal insufficiency. The patient experienced various arrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, complete AV block, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, especially in the setting of vomiting or movement. She is currently on metoprolol as tolerated and is being consulted with electrophysiology regarding how to best control her arrhythmia.

The patient had undergone balloon valvuloplasty with good effect, with no signs of volume overload currently. She is also being continued on aspirin (ASA)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS).
- She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now post-ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm repair.
- The patient tolerated well on decreasing sedation and paralytic.
- She experienced an episode of tachycardia, hypotension in the setting of nausea and vomiting.
- Preload-dependent (critical AS and tachy), received fluid resuscitation.
- Fever to 103.6 degrees Celsius, received broad-spectrum antibiotics (bcx, ucx, sputum cx).
- Tracheostomy performed due to laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts.
- The patient has a history of allergies to penicillamine and doxycycline.
- Infusions include fentanyl, midazolam, and metoprolol.
- Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 115-150 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/63 to 176/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Physical examination reveals a large right groin hematoma with a bruit.
- Labs indicate leukocytosis with white blood cell count of 19."

   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   .
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   -          verbal and environmental reorientation when appropriate
   -          continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   -          consider rheum c/s regarding management of patient
s chronic
   steroid dose
   -          d/c trazodone
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - If clinical suspicion of leak, can consider I-CT of R leg.

   # Decreased UOP: Significantly positive over the last 24 hours with UOP
   ~30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be poor forward flow due
   to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam

   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO BID with good effect and no
   reccurence.
   -Continue metoprolol

   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on wed
   - Wean as tolerated, will try on Trach mask today

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She subsequently developed a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair.

The patient's current conditions and plans include:
1. Delirium/Agitation: The etiology of the delirium is unclear, but possible causes include ICU delirium, infection, steroid-induced delirium, or drug-induced delirium. The patient should be verbally and environmentally reoriented, continue with ciprofloxacin for UTI treatment, consider rheum consult regarding chronic steroid dose management, and discontinue trazodone.
2. Pseudoaneurysm post-repair: Vascular surgery is following the patient's progress. Her hematocrit (HCT) initially trended down but is now stable. An ultrasound of the right groin shows no evidence of a continued aneurysm. The patient's HCT should be trended, and if there is clinical suspicion of a leak, an I-CT scan of the right leg may be considered.
3. Decreased UOP: The patient's urine output has significantly improved over the last 24 hours, reaching approximately 30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. The patient may have poor forward flow due to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma. IV fluids should be"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She presented for elective valvuloplasty but now requires urgent repair of a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for multiple medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8째C (100째F)
- Heart rate: 128 bpm
- Blood pressure: 165/94 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on tracheostomy mask

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her lung function is within normal limits. She has a tracheostomy in place and is being weaned off the ventilator.

The patient has a history of a klebsiella urinary tract infection, which is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin. She also has a history of congestive heart failure and is receiving medication for it.

The patient's renal function is normal, but she has decreased urine output. Her hematocrit levels are stable, and there are no signs of ongoing bleeding.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals anxiety,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. The patient initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now has undergone repair for a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Pseudoaneurysm post-repair: Vascular surgery is following. The hematocrit (HCT) initially trended down but is now stable. Ultrasound of the right groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.
2. Right groin site with increased swelling and hematoma. Serial right leg exam is being performed, and heparin is being held. If a bleed is suspected, a CT scan of the right leg will be done, and surgery will be onboard.
3. Appropriate wound care is being provided, and the patient is being watched for infection. Pain control with fentanyl and morphine as needed is being administered while weaning off sedation.
4. Tubefeeding is being restarted as tolerated.
5. Left arm exam is being done given thrombus in the brachial and cephalic vein.

Other medical conditions and plans include:
1. S/P tracheostomy: The patient reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts, and CPAP is being used for now. The plan is to wean off CP"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a large hematoma with fluid-fluid levels in the medial compartment of the thigh anterior to the common and superficial femoral arteries, as well as a small hematoma in the right pectineus muscle. There are linear foci of high attenuation that could represent hemorrhage from a tiny artery or vein of uncertain origin.
- No active extravasation from the common or superficial femoral artery or evidence of communicating pseudoaneurysm.
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and ciprofloxacin.
- Vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and respiratory alkalosis.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 1,903 mL and output of 2,185 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 282 mL.
- Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.
- Lab results indicate anemia (Hct 29.8% to 32.8%) and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 133 to 189 K/uL).
- Other findings include mild respiratory alkalosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - HCT trended up with no transfusion, patient received 1L NS and
   returned to b/l HCT
   - serial right leg exam, holding heparin
   - If suspect bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with fentanyl and morphine prn as weaning off sedation
   - restart tubefeed as tolerated
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts,tolerated CPAP for the day, however required CMV assist
   overnight [**3-7**] increased work of breathing, will wean as tolerated.
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on wed
   - Wean as tolerated.
   .
   #Vomitting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious.
   -NPO for now
   -OG tube in place for suctioning as needed
   -reduce fentanyl and slow tube feeds
   .
   # UTI: Found to have klebsiella UTI.
   -Con
t cipro
   -F/u further cultures
   -CIS
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Significantly positive over the last 24 hours with UOP
   ~30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be poor forward flow due
   to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   .
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO BID with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   -Continue metoprolol
   .
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Currently
   not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   .
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   ..
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   -will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now experiencing complications related to a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient's current conditions include a large hematoma with fluid-fluid levels in the medial compartment of the thigh anterior to the common and superficial femoral arteries, small hematoma in the right pectineus muscle, and linear foci of high attenuation representing hemorrhage from a tiny artery or vein of uncertain origin. There is no active extravasation from the common or superficial femoral artery, and no evidence of communicating pseudoaneurysm.

Medical Complications:
1. Large hematoma with fluid-fluid levels within the medial compartment of the thigh anterior to the common and superficial femoral arteries, as well as a small hematoma in the right pectineus muscle.
2. No active extravasation from the common or superficial femoral artery, and no evidence of communicating pseudoaneurysm.
3. Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Decreased urine output (UOP) of approximately 30 cc/hr over the last 24 hours.
5. Delirium and agitation, potentially caused by steroid-induced delirium.
6. Tachycardia (tach) managed with metoprolol.
7. Vomiting, possibly related to fentanyl-induced gastroparesis.
8. Hyperlipidemia.
9. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) being managed with prednisone, methotrexate, and leucovorin.
10. Aortic stenosis (AS) treated with balloon valvuloplasty.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation by a medical professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but developed a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications.

Impressions:
1. Large hematoma with fluid-fluid levels in the medial compartment of the thigh anterior to the common and superficial femoral arteries. There is also a small hematoma in the right pectineus muscle, and linear foci of high attenuation representing hemorrhage from a tiny artery or vein of uncertain origin.
2. No active extravasation from the common or superficial femoral artery, nor evidence of communicating pseudoaneurysm.

Allergies:
- Penicillamine: rash
- Doxycycline: nausea/vomiting

Medications:
- Fentanyl (Concentrate): 25 mcg/hour
- Midazolam (Versed): given on [**2107-12-4**] at 05:55 PM
- Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis): given on [**2107-12-5**] at 01:45 AM
- Metoprolol: given on [**2107-12-5**] at 03:25 AM

Other ICU medications:
- Ciprofloxacin: given on [**2107-12-5**] at 03:00 AM
- Vancomycin: given on [**2107-12-3**] at 10:30 PM

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Continued bleeding or re-bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm site, requiring further surgical intervention.
2. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity due to prolonged immobilization.
3. Infection at the surgical site or wound care area.
4. Delirium or agitation, possibly due to steroid-induced delirium, infection, or other factors.
5. Respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or laryngeal edema.
6. Decreased urine output and potential renal dysfunction.
7. Gastrointestinal issues, including vomiting and possible gastroparesis.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She now presents with a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient's current condition includes leukocytosis, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, tracheostomy, vomiting, urinary tract infection, decreased urine output, tachycardia, agitation, and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleeding: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm repair. Continuous monitoring and serial right leg exams are recommended to detect any signs of re-bleeding. If there is suspicion of re-bleeding, a CT scan of the right leg may be performed, and surgery will be on board.
2. Infection: The patient has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection. Cultures have been taken, and appropriate antibiotics are being administered. The patient's wound care will be monitored for any signs of infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a provoked left upper extremity DVT. Serial measurements of the affected arm show a decrease in size, indicating improvement. No heparin will be given after the bleed on Friday.
4. Tracheostomy management: The patient had lary"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable, in fact increased to 38.3.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of
   continued aneurysm.  On [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling
   and hematoma, reeval for hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent
   readjusted, resolved.
   - HCT trended up with no transfusion, patient received 1L NS and
   returned to b/l HCT
   - serial right leg exam, holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn as vomiting likely [**3-7**] versed
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   #LUE DVT
 likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - Serial measurement today reveals decreased size from 30->27cm at the
   Elbow, and 27->23 at the upper arm
   - No heparin after bleed on Friday
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts, tolerated CPAP for the day, however required CMV assist
   overnight [**3-7**] increased work of breathing, will wean as tolerated.   As
   she continues to overbreath the vent, we will switch her back to CPAP
   - Given respiratory alkalosis, will change to CPAP
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on wed
   - Wean as tolerated.
   #Vomitting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious.
   -NPO for now
   -OG tube in place for suctioning as needed
   -reduce fentanyl and slow tube feeds
   # UTI: Found to have klebsiella UTI.
   -Con
t cipro
   -F/u further cultures
   -CIS
   # Decreased UOP: Significantly positive over the last 24 hours with UOP
   ~30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be poor forward flow due
   to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   -bolus as needed
   -Urine lytes, calculate GFR
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO BID with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   -Continue metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Currently
   not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   -will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now post-ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. 

The patient's current conditions include a decreased hematocrit (Hct) which initially trended down but has now stabilized and increased to 38.3. There is also a concern for re-bleeding in the right groin site, as evidenced by increased swelling and hematoma. Serial right leg exams will be performed, and if there is suspicion of re-bleeding, a CT scan of the right leg will be done, with surgery on board. The patient is also being monitored for infection at the wound site. 

Additionally, the patient has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) likely extending to the heart, for which she is being monitored closely. 

The patient had a tracheostomy performed due to laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts. She tolerated CPAP for the day but required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) assist overnight. The plan is to wean her off the ventilator as tolerated, switching her back to CPAP as she continues to overbreathe the vent.

The patient experienced vomiting, which may be related to fentanyl-induced gastrop"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - HCT trended up with no transfusion, patient received 1L NS and
   returned to b/l HCT
   - serial right leg exam, holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn as vomiting likely [**3-7**] versed (stopped
   on [**12-5**])
   .
   # leukocytosis: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.
   - continue ciprofloxacin
   - reculture blood, urine
   - recheck WBC differential
   .
   #LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement today reveals decreased size from 30->27cm at the
   Elbow, and 27->23 at the upper arm
   - No heparin after bleed on Friday.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On CPAP with pressure support yesterday, switched to trach
   mask this AM.  As patient appeared to dislike trach mask, d/ced this as
   well for now.
   - recheck ABG
   - last ABG shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain
   response.  Continuing pain control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on wed
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   -NPO for now
   -standing zofran fixed nausea, may consider starting tube feed as
   tolerated.
   -reduce fentanyl and slow tube feeds
   # UTI: Found to have klebsiella UTI.
   - Cont cipro (day 1 [**12-4**])
   - F/u further cultures
   - CIS
   # Decreased UOP: Significantly positive over the last 24 hours with UOP
   ~30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be poor forward flow due
   to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma.  Urine lytes
   showed prerenal picture with FeNa of 0.3% with elevated urine osm.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Currently
   not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   -will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now has a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that required surgical repair. There is a possibility of re-bleeding, which can be assessed through serial right leg exams and a repeat CT scan of the right leg if necessary.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which is likely provoked. Serial measurements reveal a decrease in the size of the thrombus. Heparin therapy should be continued, and the patient's left arm should be monitored.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a klebsiella UTI, and appropriate antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) have been started. Further cultures will be followed, and the patient's urine output should be monitored.
4. Decreased Urine Output: The patient has significantly decreased urine output, which could be due to volume overload, third-spacing of fluids with recent trauma, or prerenal azotemia. The patient's renal function remains normal, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now has a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Pseudoaneurysm s/p repair: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is ongoing monitoring for any signs of continued aneurysm, and an ultrasound of the right groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm. However, there is increased swelling and hematoma at the right groin site, which requires reevaluation. Serial right leg exams are being performed, and heparin has been held. If there is suspicion of re-bleed, a CT scan of the right leg will be done, and surgery will be on board. Appropriate wound care is also being provided, and the patient is being monitored for infection.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be attributed to multiple reasons such as the right groin incision, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), underlying rheumatoid arthritis, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia, and chronic steroid use. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable, in fact increased to 38.3.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of
   continued aneurysm.  On [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling
   and hematoma, reeval for hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent
   readjusted, resolved.
   - HCT trended up with no transfusion, patient received 1L NS and
   returned to b/l HCT
   - serial right leg exam, holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn as vomiting likely [**3-7**] versed (stopped
   on [**12-5**])
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   .
   # leukocytosis: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.
   - continue abx
   - consider broadening coverage.
   .
   #LUE DVT
 likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - Serial measurement today reveals decreased size from 30->27cm at the
   Elbow, and 27->23 at the upper arm
   - No heparin after bleed on Friday
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts, tolerated CPAP for the day, however required CMV assist
   overnight [**3-7**] increased work of breathing, will wean as tolerated.   As
   she continues to overbreath the vent, we will switch her back to CPAP
   - Given respiratory alkalosis, will change to CPAP
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on wed
   - Wean as tolerated.
   #Vomitting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   -NPO for now
   -standing zofran fixed nausea, may consider starting tube feed as
   tolerated.
   -reduce fentanyl and slow tube feeds
   # UTI: Found to have klebsiella UTI.
   -Con
t cipro (day 1 [**12-4**])
   -F/u further cultures
   -CIS
   # Decreased UOP: Significantly positive over the last 24 hours with UOP
   ~30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be poor forward flow due
   to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   -bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   -Urine lytes
 showed prerenal picture with FeNa of 0.3% with elevated
   urine osm.
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO BID with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   -Continue metoprolol
   -bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Currently
   not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   -will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin
   FEN:  NPO for now

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who presented for elective valvuloplasty. She is currently in the ICU after experiencing a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and subsequent repair. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), delirium, agitation, and hyperlipidemia. She underwent balloon valvuloplasty with good effect and has been on chronic steroid use for her rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleeding: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is a risk of re-bleeding, and further monitoring is required.
2. DVT: The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which is likely provoked and possibly related to recent procedures. Heparin has been withheld due to a hematoma at the site, but serial exams are planned, and a CT scan may be necessary if there is suspicion of re-bleeding.
3. UTI: The patient has a klebsiella UTI that needs to be treated with antibiotics. Cultures have been sent for further evaluation.
4. Tracheostomy management: The patient has a tracheostomy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She now presents with a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and subsequent repair. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection, delirium, agitation, decreased urine output, and hyperlipidemia. She also underwent balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleeding: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is concern for re-bleeding, and the patient is being closely monitored with serial right leg exams and a plan for a CT scan if necessary.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which is likely provoked and possibly related to central line placement. She is being monitored with serial left arm exams and no heparin is being administered due to the recent bleeding event.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a klebsiella UTI, for which she is being continued on ciprofloxacin. Further cultures will be followed up, and appropriate care will be taken to prevent the spread of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - HCT trended up with no transfusion, patient received 1L NS and
   returned to b/l HCT
   - serial right leg exam, holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn as vomiting likely [**3-7**] versed (stopped
   on [**12-5**])
   .
   # leukocytosis: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia.
   - continue ciprofloxacin
   - repeat urine dipstick sent [**12-6**] neg, BCx neg thus far
   .
   #LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement today reveals decreased size from 30->27cm at the
   Elbow, and 27->23 at the upper arm
   - No heparin after bleed on Friday.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On CPAP with pressure support yesterday, switched to trach
   mask this AM.  As patient appeared to dislike trach mask, d/ced this as
   well for now.
   - recheck ABG
   - last ABG shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain
   response.  Continuing pain control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on wed
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   -NPO for now
   -standing zofran fixed nausea, may consider starting tube feed as
   tolerated.
   -reduce fentanyl and slow tube feeds
   # UTI: Found to have klebsiella UTI.
   - Cont cipro (day 1 [**12-4**])
   - F/u further cultures
   - CIS
   # Decreased UOP: Significantly positive over the last 24 hours with UOP
   ~30 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be poor forward flow due
   to volume overload, third-spacing with recent trauma.  Urine lytes
   showed prerenal picture with FeNa of 0.3% with elevated urine osm.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Currently
   not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   -will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She subsequently developed a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair. The patient has multiple medical complications, including leukocytosis, a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a urinary tract infection (UTI), vomiting, decreased urine output, tachycardia, delirium, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleeding: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is a possibility of re-bleeding, which is being monitored closely with serial right leg exams and a plan for a repeat CT scan of the right leg if needed.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could indicate an underlying infection. She also has a UTI caused by klebsiella, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. Further cultures will be followed up to ensure treatment is effective.

3. DVT: The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which is likely provoked and possibly related to recent central venous catheterization. Monitoring of the extremity and serial measurements reveal decreased size of the thrombus.

4. Decreased urine output: The"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. The patient underwent the procedure but experienced complications including a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm, which required surgical repair. 

The patient's current medical conditions include leukocytosis with a possible underlying cause of right groin incision, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left upper extremity, urinary tract infection (UTI), decreased urine output, tachycardia, delirium, and a history of recent tracheostomy and balloon valvuloplasty. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has an ongoing UTI caused by Klebsiella, and there is also a concern for wound infection at the site of the pseudoaneurysm repair. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment is essential.

2. Bleeding: The patient had a significant bleed in the past, leading to the need for blood transfusions. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and serial examination of the surgical site is necessary to detect any signs of re-bleeding.

3. Thrombosis: The patient has a confirmed DVT in the left upper extremity, which may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable thus
   - serial right leg exam, holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn
   .
   # leukocytosis: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend
   - continue ciprofloxacin
   - repeat urine dipstick sent [**12-6**] (neg,) BCx neg thus far
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG
   - last ABG shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain
   response.  Continuing pain control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, plan to downsize to #6 on [**Doctor First Name **]/fri
   - S+S to see her today
   .
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].  Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].
   Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   - NPO for now pending S+S recs
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   .
   # UTI: Found to have klebsiella UTI.
   - Cont cipro (day 1 [**12-4**])
   - F/u further cultures
   - CIS
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated tonight
   - continue ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn
 increased to Q2H prn from Q4H (36mg
   of IV morphine in 24hrs).
   - switched to PO dosaging once able to swallow.
   - watch JP drain
 vascular managing.
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CIS
   - repeat urine dipstick sent [**12-6**] (neg,) BCx neg thus far
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - plan for S+S to see her again, as need to eval for ability to swallow
   .
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].  Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].
   Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - got dobhoff tube again
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now has a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. 

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pseudoaneurysm: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm, which was repaired. However, there is concern for re-bleeding, and the patient's hematocrit levels are being monitored. If there is suspicion of re-bleeding, a CT scan of the right leg will be done, and surgery will be on board.

2. DVT: The patient has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that is likely provoked by recent cardiac catheterization. Serial measurements and no heparin are planned due to the development of a groin hematoma.

3. UTI: The patient has leukocytosis and signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which was found to be caused by Klebsiella. Antibiotics were completed, and cultures are being followed.

4. Tracheostomy: The patient underwent tracheostomy, and laryngeal edema was reported after multiple intubation attempts. The trache"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She now has a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is a possibility of re-bleeding, which can be assessed by serial right leg exams and a CT scan of the right leg if necessary. If re-bleeding occurs, surgery will be required.

2. Leukocytosis/UTI: The patient has leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Klebsiella UTI was identified, and the patient completed a course of ciprofloxacin. The CBC trend should be monitored, and cultures and CIS should be followed up.

3. Left Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a provoked DVT in the left upper extremity, likely related to recent cardiac catheterization. Serial measurements and examinations of the left arm will be performed. Heparin should not be initiated due to the previous hematoma development.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.  JP
   drain was removed.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn, consider increase given requiring
   more.
   - switch to PO dosaging once able to swallow.
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CIS
   - repeat urine dipstick sent [**12-6**] (neg,) BCx neg thus far
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - plan for S+S to see her again, as need to eval for ability to swallow
   .
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].  Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].
   Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - got dobhoff tube again
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now post-ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm which has been repaired. However, there is still concern for possible re-bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and serial right leg exams are being performed. Heparin has been held, and a CT scan of the right leg will be done if there is suspicion of re-bleeding.

2. Leukocytosis/UTI: The patient has leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count and a positive urine culture for klebsiella UTI. Antibiotics were completed, and cultures are being followed up. The patient's blood culture was negative.

3. Left Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a provoked DVT in the left upper extremity, likely due to recent cardiac catheterization. Serial left arm exams are being performed, and no heparin is given due to the recent hematoma development.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.  JP
   drain was removed.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn, consider increase given requiring
   more (36mg of IV morphine in 24hrs).
   - switched to PO dosaging once able to swallow.
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CIS
   - repeat urine dipstick sent [**12-6**] (neg,) BCx neg thus far
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - plan for S+S to see her again, as need to eval for ability to swallow
   .
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].  Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].
   Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - got dobhoff tube again
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but later developed a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and underwent repair. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis/UTI, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), tracheostomy-related issues, and vomiting. Her current vital signs show tachycardia, mild respiratory alkalosis, and stable hemoglobin levels. The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium, famotidine, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and others. She is receiving IV fluids and has been given a dobbhoff tube for enteral nutrition. The patient's recent lab results indicate normal renal function, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly decreased hemoglobin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleeding: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is a risk of re-bleeding, and further monitoring is required.
2. Infection at the surgical site: The patient has an increased risk of infection due to the surgical procedure and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which could lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn
 increased to Q2H prn from Q4H (36mg
   of IV morphine in 24hrs).
   - switched to PO dosaging once able to swallow.
   - watch JP drain
 vascular managing.
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CIS
   - repeat urine dipstick sent [**12-6**] (neg,) BCx neg thus far
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - plan for S+S to see her again, as need to eval for ability to swallow
   - Passimure trial today
   - Consider X-ray vs CT scan
   .
   #Vomiting:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced gastroparesis and
   inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly
   bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].  Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].
   Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Needs IR guided Dobhoff this AM
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - bolus as needed, I/O even to positive.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   - convert morphine to fentanyl patch
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She now presents with a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis/UTI, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), tracheostomy with possible pneumonia, chronic steroid use, and vomiting. She also has concerns related to delirium, agitation, renal function, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleeding: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that was repaired. There is a concern for potential re-bleeding, and the plan includes monitoring the right leg and performing a CT scan of the right leg if there are any signs of re-bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and increased swelling at the right thigh site with yellow fluid drainage. There is a concern for wound infection, and appropriate wound care is being provided.
3. DVT: The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which is likely provoked by recent procedures. Anticoagulation therapy will be continued, and serial measurements of the extremity will be performed.
4. Tracheostomy"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now post-ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has several medical complications including leukocytosis/UTI, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), tracheostomy with possible pneumonia, chronic steroid use, and vomiting. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pseudoaneurysm re-bleed: The patient had a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm repair, and there is concern for continued bleeding. Serial right leg exams and monitoring for hematoma are being done. If a re-bleed is suspected, a CT scan of the right leg will be performed, and surgery will be on board.
2. Infection: The patient has an increased risk of infection due to the presence of a tracheostomy, chronic steroid use, and recent surgery. Appropriate wound care and monitoring for signs of infection are important.
3. UTI: The patient has leukocytosis and a positive urine culture for Klebsiella, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic therapy has been completed, and follow-up cultures will be done.
4. DVT: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now status post ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has undergone several medical interventions and procedures, including tracheostomy, nutritional support, vascular management, and more.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has diffuse pharyngeal edema with airway narrowing at the level of the epiglottis, as seen on CT neck. This can lead to respiratory distress or failure if not managed appropriately. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy and requires careful monitoring and management of her airway.

2. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has been experiencing vomiting and difficulty with nutrition. She has pulled out her OG tube and Dobhoff tube multiple times. The patient's ability to tolerate oral intake is limited, and she may require alternative methods of nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and a positive culture for klebsiella UTI. She also has risk factors for other infections, including prolonged immobility, tracheostomy, and chronic steroid use. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms is necessary to detect any signs of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now requires medical attention due to a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and subsequent repair.

The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including a tracheostomy, which resulted in laryngeal edema. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturation. The patient also had a trial of Passy-Muir valve insertion but was unable to vocalize coherently. The CT scan revealed diffuse pharyngeal edema with airway narrowing at the level of the epiglottis.

The patient has experienced multiple episodes of vomiting and difficulties with nutrition. She pulled out her own oral gastric (OG) tube on 12/5 and Dobhoff tube on 12/6. Currently, she is doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates, and has refused further Dobhoff tube placement. It is planned to initiate total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to her resistance to feeding tubes and the need for nutritional support.

The patient also presents with leukocytosis, possibly related to various factors such as the right groin incision, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), underlying rheumatoid arthritis, tracheost"

   especially at the level of the epiglottis. Aberrant foci of gas
   posterior to the oropharynx and at the level of the thyroid cartilage
   that may relate to traumatic intubation.  Partial opacification of the
   ethmoid air cells and mastoid air cells. Small air-fluid level in the
   left maxillary sinus. Bilateral apical pleural effusions. Left lung
   atelectasis and ground glass opacities.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Passimure trial yesterday, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Patient refused dobhoff tube and will need to get TPN placement. Can
   tolerate PO
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - TPN on horizon
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CXR read CIS
   - f/u differential,
   - f/u reculture before empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn
 increased to Q2H prn from Q4H (28 mg
   morphine for the past 24hrs.).
   - switched to PO dosaging once able to swallow.
   - watch JP drain
 vascular managing.
   - PT c/s
 need to eval prior to rehab placement.
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - keep I/O negative given 8kg up.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   - convert morphine to fentanyl patch
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin

   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passimure trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflamation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced yesterday, restarting tubefeeds.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Re-start tubefeeds
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CXR read CIS
   - f/u differential,
   - f/u reculture before empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO dosaging now that she is able to swallow.
   -  Vascular placing wound vac
   - PT c/s
 need to eval prior to rehab placement.

   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - keep I/O negative given 8kg up.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - starting leukovorin and hold SQ MTX for now
   - started po steroids
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. The patient initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now suffering from a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair.

The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and balloon valvuloplasty. She also has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has been on anticoagulation therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Passimure trial yesterday, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced yesterday, restarting tubefeeds.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Re-start tubefeeds
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC
   - f/u cultures, CXR read CIS
   - f/u differential,
   - f/u reculture before empiric coverage.
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with morphine prn
 increased to Q2H prn from Q4H (28 mg
   morphine for the past 24hrs.).
   - switched to PO dosaging once able to swallow.
   - watch JP drain
 vascular managing.
   - PT c/s
 need to eval prior to rehab placement.
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - keep I/O negative given 8kg up.
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   - bolus to even/slight positive I/O
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone and methotrexate/leucovorin.  Will need to
   discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive
   POs currently and MTX cannot be given via NGT.
   - will start SQ MTX once edema resolves
   - start steroids when PO ok vs low dose IV equivalent
   - pain control with IV morphine.
   - convert morphine to fentanyl patch
   # Hyperlipidemia: Con't statin
   FEN:  NPO for now, pt refusing Dobhoff.  Discuss Sedation and PEG with
   family

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now post-ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and balloon valvuloplasty.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's ABG shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis, which could be due to pain response or other factors. She is being monitored, and pain control with morphine is being continued.
2. Laryngeal edema: The patient reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts. She is currently on a tracheostomy with good oxygen saturation.
3. Vomiting and nutrition: The patient has been experiencing vomiting, possibly related to fentanyl-induced gastroparesis. She pulled out her oral gastric (OG) tube on 12-5 and pulled out the doboff tube on 12-6. She is doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates, and has had her doboff tube replaced. Tubefeedings are being restarted.
4. Leukocytosis/UTI: The patient has leukocytosis and a Klebsiella UTI"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now experiencing complications. The patient underwent a tracheostomy due to laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts. She also has a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that has been repaired.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving pain management with morphine. Her oxygen saturation is good. She is being monitored for acid-base status with ABG, which shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis. The patient is also being evaluated for her ability to swallow.

The patient has had issues with vomiting and nutrition, pulling out her oral gastric (OG) and Dobhoff tubes. She is currently doing well with Zofran and reduced opiates. The Dobhoff tube has been replaced, and tubefeds have been restarted.

Leukocytosis is present, likely due to reasons such as right groin incision, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infection (UTI), underlying rheumatoid arthritis, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia, or chronic steroid use. The patient has been found to have a Klebsiella UTI. Her white blood cell count has trended down, but she is still receiving empirical coverage with Vancomycin and Cefepime.

The patient also has a history of a pseudoaneurysm after repair, for which vascular surgery is following. Her hematocrit initially trended down but is now stable. An ultrasound of the right groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm. The patient is being monitored for any signs of re-bleeding and is receiving appropriate wound care.

The patient has a left upper extremity DVT, which is likely provoked and possibly related to a cardiac event. Serial measurements of her left arm are being taken.

The patient's urine output has increased significantly over the last 24 hours, and her renal function remains normal. She is being monitored closely, and IV fluids are being given if clinically volume depleted.

The patient experienced episodes of tachycardia, which have been well-controlled with metoprolol. Her delirium and agitation are being managed with olanzapine and haloperidol as needed.

The patient underwent balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of volume overload are currently present. She continues to take aspirin and will need to discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs as she cannot receive oral medications currently.

The patient's rheumatoid arthritis is being managed with prednisone, and she will need to discuss with rheumatology how to dose DMARDs. Her hyperlipidemia medication has been discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflammation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - Dobhoff with stabilizing ring is plan for now.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Re-start tubefeeds
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC.  Will repeat CXR, repeat CX.
   - f/u cultures, CXR read CIS
   - f/u differential,
   - empiric coverage with Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO dosaging now that she is able to swallow.
   - vascular placed wound vac
   - PT c/s
 need to eval prior to rehab placement.
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - once either swallowing pills or edema resolves can start methotrexate
   with leucovorin
   - started po steroids
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone
   # Hyperlipidemia: d/c statin

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now experiencing a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair.

2. The patient underwent tracheostomy due to reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts. She is currently on a tracheostomy with good oxygen saturation and monitoring acid-base status with ABG. The last ABG shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis.

3. The patient had vomiting and nutrition issues, including pulling out OG and Dobhoff tubes. She is doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates, and restarting tube feeds.

4. The patient has leukocytosis and a urinary tract infection (UTI), with multiple reasons such as right groin incision, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), UTI, underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia, and chronic steroid use. The WBC count initially increased but is now trending down.

5. The patient had a pseudoaneurysm after repair, and vascular surgery is following up. The hematocrit (Hct) initially trended down but is now stable. Ultrasound of the right groin shows no evidence of continued aneur"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflammation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - Dobhoff with stabilizing ring is plan for now.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Re-start tubefeeds
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.
   - completed ciprofloxacin, trend CBC.  Will repeat CXR, repeat CX.
   - f/u cultures, CXR read CIS
   - f/u differential,
   - empiric coverage with Vanc/Cefepime
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.  Had mild resp. alkalosis
 vent readjusted, resolved.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stablem, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO dosaging now that she is able to swallow.
   - vascular placed wound vac
   - PT c/s
 need to eval prior to rehab placement.
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein.
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Initially oliguric, but significantly positive over the last 24
   hours with UOP ~200 cc/hr. Renal function remains normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   autodiuresis [**3-7**] remobilzation of third-spaced fluids.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   - goal is to boost UOP
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Unclear etiology; could be ICU delirium vs.
   sundowning vs. infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced
   (trazodone).  Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced
   delirium.  Currently not active. Hold all delirium inducing meds.  Much
   improved in last 24 hours.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - once either swallowing pills or edema resolves can start methotrexate
   with leucovorin
   - started po steroids
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone
   # Hyperlipidemia: d/c statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but now requires treatment for several medical complications.

The patient has recently undergone a tracheostomy due to laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturation. Acid-base status is being monitored with ABG, which shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis. Pain control is being provided with morphine, and tracheostomy management is being handled by thoracics, downsized to #6. The patient is also undergoing a Passy-Muir trial, able to make good efforts but unable to voice, with CT showing edema. ENT consultation will be discussed for methods to reduce inflammation.

The patient has experienced vomiting and nutrition issues, possibly related to fentanyl-induced gastroparesis and the inability to check tube feed residuals. She pulled out her OG tube on 12-5 and Dobhoff tube on 12-6. However, she is doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates, and has had her Dobhoff tube replaced on 12-9 with the restart of tube feeds. A nasal bridle plan is being considered for now. Hypophosphatemia is suspected to be [**3-7**] re-feeding, and phosphate repletion will be addressed.

The patient also has leukocytosis/UTI, with multiple reasons including right groin incision, DVT, UTI, underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia, and chronic steroid use. Her WBC count increased after stopping cipro, and she has been started on vancomycin and cefepime empirically. Cultures will be followed up, and a chest X-ray shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time.

Regarding the pseudoaneurysm after repair, vascular surgery is following. The patient's Hct initially trended down but is now stable. An ultrasound of the right groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm. However, there is increased swelling and hematoma in the right groin site, and a reevaluation for hematoma is necessary. Serial right leg exams will be conducted, and heparin will be held. If there is a suspicion of re-bleed, a repeat CT of the right leg will be performed, and surgery will be consulted. Appropriate wound care will be provided, and watchfulness for infection is advised. Pain control with oxycodone PRN has been increased to q4h PRN, and the patient is now able to swallow, allowing for oral pain medication.

The patient has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is provoked and likely [**3-7**] cordis. She is not currently on anticoagulation. Serial measurements of her left arm will be taken, considering the thrombus in the brachial and cephalic vein, which remains stable thus far. No heparin will be given after the development of a groin hematoma. Anticoagulation will be discussed with vascular surgery if needed.

Other issues include mild contraction alkalosis with reduced urine output yesterday, which responded to an IVF bolus. The patient's tachycardia was well-controlled with metoprolol, and her delirium/agitation has resolved, likely due to steroid-induced delirium. Olanzapine and haldol will be considered as needed. The patient's valves have shown good effect after balloon valvuloplasty"

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 11334**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   On Vanc and Cefipime for new fever.
   Still complaining of groin and joint pain.
   Medical Decision Making
   Discuss stabilization ring with surgery for Dubhoff.
   Continue antibiotics while await cultures.
   CT of groin for possible abscess.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now experiencing complications post-operation. The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy, repair of a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm, and balloon valvuloplasty.

The patient's current medical issues include leukocytosis/UTI, pseudoaneurysm post-repair, left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ongoing pain management. The patient also has a history of vomiting/nutrition, delirium/agitation, and hyperlipidemia.

Assessment and plan:
1. S/P tracheostomy: The patient reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts. She is currently on a trach mask with good oxygen saturation. Monitoring acid-base status with ABG shows evidence of respiratory alkalosis. Pain control with morphine, and trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6. Continue Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort but not able to voice, CT showed edema. Will discuss methods for reducing inflammation with ENT.

2. Vomiting/Nutrition: The patient possibly related to fentanyl-induced gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though vomiting was mostly bilious"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflammation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - Dobhoff with nasal bridle plan for now.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Restarted tubefeeds.
   - hypophosphatemia possibly [**3-7**] re-feeding, will replete phosphate
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.  Started on vanc + cefepime empirically.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue abx.
   - CXR shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO pain rx now that she is able to swallow.
   - wound VAC was placed by vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis.  Currently not on
   anticoagulation.
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein,
   remains stable thus far
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   - discuss with vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**] re: anticoagulation if needed
   .
   # UOP: Appeared to have mild contraction alkalosis with reduced UOP
   yesterday, responded to IVF bolus.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Initially confused, likely [**3-7**] sundowning vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Resolved at
   this time.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - methotrexate with leucovorin
   - daily po prednisone
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone
   # Hyperlipidemia: d/ced statin
   FEN:  tubefeeds via Dobhoff

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflammation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - Dobhoff with nasal bridle plan for now.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Restarted tubefeeds.
   - hypophosphatemia possibly [**3-7**] re-feeding, will replete phosphate
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.  Started on vanc + cefepime empirically.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue abx.
   - CXR shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO pain rx now that she is able to swallow.
   - wound VAC was placed by vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis.  Currently not on
   anticoagulation.
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein,
   remains stable thus far
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   - discuss with vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**] re: anticoagulation if needed
   .
   # UOP: Appeared to have mild contraction alkalosis with reduced UOP
   yesterday, responded to IVF bolus.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Initially confused, likely [**3-7**] sundowning vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Resolved at
   this time.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - methotrexate with leucovorin
   - daily po prednisone
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone
   # Hyperlipidemia: d/ced statin
   FEN:  tubefeeds via Dobhoff

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now experiencing several medical complications. 

The patient underwent a tracheostomy due to laryngeal edema following multiple intubation attempts. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturation, and ABG monitoring is being conducted to assess her acid-base status. 

The patient also has issues related to vomiting/nutrition. She pulled out her oral-gastric (OG) tube on December 5th and her Dobhoff tube on December 6th. However, she is doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates, and has had her Dobhoff tube replaced on December 9th. Tubefeeds have been restarted, and a nasal bridle plan is being considered for now. 

Leukocytosis/UTI is another concern. The patient has an increased white blood cell count and is at risk for urinary tract infection (UTI). She was found to have a klebsiella UTI and has been started on vancomycin and cefepime empirically. Cultures are being followed up, and the antibiotics will be continued. 

The patient also has a history of a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm that required repair"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - on Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to voice,
   CT showed edema.
   - plan to d/c to rehab, where patient can be weaned
   .
   # Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - retry nasal bridle for Dobhoff
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Restarted tubefeeds.
   - will start Reglan with tube feeds to promote motility, reduce risk of
   vomiting/aspiration
   - hypophosphatemia possibly [**3-7**] re-feeding, will replete phosphate
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.  Started on vanc + cefepime empirically.  [**Month (only) 51**] have
   aspiration pneumonitis [**3-7**] event yesterday.  On appropriate therapy.
   - continue vanc + cefepime
   - redose vanc to 1g IV q24h
   - f/u cultures
   - continue abx
   - CXR shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO pain rx now that she is able to swallow.
   - wound VAC was placed by vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   - will f/u c Vsurg as outpatient
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis.  Currently not on
   anticoagulation.
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein,
   remains stable thus far
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Appeared to have mild contraction alkalosis with reduced UOP
   yesterday, responded to IVF bolus.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Initially confused, likely [**3-7**] sundowning vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Resolved at
   this time.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - methotrexate with leucovorin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now status post ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has undergone several procedures including tracheostomy, placement of nasogastric (NG) and dobbhoff (Dob) tubes, and balloon valvuloplasty. She also has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently not on anticoagulation.

The patient's current condition includes laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts, respiratory alkalosis, vomiting related to fentanyl-induced gastroparesis, leukocytosis potentially due to UTI or other causes, hypophosphatemia possibly related to re-feeding syndrome, and delirium potentially caused by steroids or other factors. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a history of RA, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Her recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pain management with opioids, antacids, and antibiotics. She is also receiving nutritional support through tube feeds and has ongoing prophylactic measures for DVT,"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - on Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to voice,
   CT showed edema.
   - plan to d/c to rehab, where patient can be weaned
   .
   # Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - retry nasal bridle for Dobhoff
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Restarted tubefeeds.
   - will start Reglan with tube feeds to promote motility, reduce risk of
   vomiting/aspiration
   - hypophosphatemia possibly [**3-7**] re-feeding, will replete phosphate
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.  Started on vanc + cefepime empirically.  [**Month (only) 51**] have
   aspiration pneumonitis [**3-7**] event yesterday.  On appropriate therapy.
   - continue vanc + cefepime
   - redose vanc to 1g IV q24h
   - f/u cultures
   - continue abx
   - CXR shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO pain rx now that she is able to swallow.
   - wound VAC was placed by vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   - will f/u c Vsurg as outpatient
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis.  Currently not on
   anticoagulation.
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein,
   remains stable thus far
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Appeared to have mild contraction alkalosis with reduced UOP
   yesterday, responded to IVF bolus.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Initially confused, likely [**3-7**] sundowning vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Resolved at
   this time.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F c h/o RA, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic AS who initially
   presented for elective valvuloplasty, now s/p ruptured right groin
   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - Continue Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to
   voice, CT showed edema.
   - will discuss methods for reducing inflammation with ENT
   .
   #Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - Dobhoff with nasal bridle plan for now.
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Restarted tubefeeds.
   - hypophosphatemia possibly [**3-7**] re-feeding, will replete phosphate
   .
   # leukocytosis/UTI: multiple reasons
 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.  Started on vanc + cefepime empirically.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue abx.
   - CXR shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO pain rx now that she is able to swallow.
   - wound VAC was placed by vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis.  Currently not on
   anticoagulation.
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein,
   remains stable thus far
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   - discuss with vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**] re: anticoagulation if needed
   .
   # UOP: Appeared to have mild contraction alkalosis with reduced UOP
   yesterday, responded to IVF bolus.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Initially confused, likely [**3-7**] sundowning vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Resolved at
   this time.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - methotrexate with leucovorin
   - daily po prednisone
   - pain control with fentanyl patch and oxycodone
   # Hyperlipidemia: d/ced statin

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis. She initially presented for elective valvuloplasty but is now suffering from a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient also has a tracheostomy, which was placed due to reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation attempts.

The patient's recent events include failure of nasal bridle placement, vomiting of bilious fluid, and copious sputum that required deep suctioning. Tubefeeds were temporarily held, and broadened antibiotics were added to cover anaerobes. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillamine and doxycycline.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9째C (100.3째F)
- Heart rate: 85 bpm (with a range of 78-124 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 138/56 mmHg (with a range of 75/39-178/94 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-34 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on tracheal mask

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, hy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and symptomatic aortic stenosis who initially presented for elective valvuloplasty. She now presents with a ruptured right groin pseudoaneurysm and repair. The patient has undergone several procedures, including tracheostomy, placement of a Dobhoff tube, and balloon valvuloplasty. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including vomiting, leukocytosis, UTI, delirium, agitation, hyperlipidemia, and DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Vomiting/Nutrition: The patient has been experiencing vomiting, possibly related to fentanyl-induced gastroparesis and the inability to check tube feed residuals. She has also pulled out her OG tube and Dobhoff tube. The plan is to retry nasal bridle for Dobhoff, restart tube feeds, and start Reglan with tube feeds to promote motility and reduce the risk of vomiting and aspiration.

2. Leukocytosis/UTI: The patient has leukocytosis with an increased white blood cell count and signs of infection, likely due to multiple reasons such as right groin incision, DVT, UTI, underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia, and chronic steroid use. The patient has a Klebsiella UTI and is being treated with vancomycin and c"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. They have a history of laryngeal edema, aortic stenosis, alteration in nutrition, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic anemia, and pain control issues. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4째C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/53 mmHg to 157/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for developing blood clots in the upper extremity due to immobility and possible venous stasis.
2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has a persistent fever, which can be indicative of an underlying infection or another medical condition that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, putting them at risk for further complications such as infections or pressure ulcers.
4. Pain control: The patient has a history of pain related to chronic conditions and acute pain management needs to be addressed to ensure comfort.

   pseudoaneurysm and repair.
   # S/P tracheostomy: Reported laryngeal edema after multiple intubation
   attempts.  On trach mask with good oxygen saturation.
   - monitoring acid-base status with ABG.  last ABG shows evidence of
   respiratory alkalosis.  Could be [**3-7**] pain response.  Continuing pain
   control c morphine.  S+S saw her again, as need to eval for ability to
   swallow
   - Trach management per thoracics, downsized to #6
   - on Passy-Muir trial, able to make good effort, but not able to voice,
   CT showed edema.
   - plan to d/c to rehab, where patient can be weaned
   .
   # Vomiting/Nutrition:  Possibly related to fentanyl induced
   gastroparesis and inability to check tube feed residuals, though
   vomiting was mostly bilious. Patient pulled out OG tube on [**12-5**].
   Pulled out dobhoff [**12-6**].  Doing well with Zofran, reduced opiates.
   Dobhoff replaced [**12-9**], restarted tubefeeds.
   - per Surgery, will not reattempt nasal bridle
   - standing zofran fixed nausea
   - Restarted tubefeeds.
   - will start Reglan with tube feeds to promote motility, reduce risk of
   vomiting/aspiration
   - hypophosphatemia possibly [**3-7**] re-feeding, will replete phosphate

 right groin incision, dvt, uti,
   underlying RA, tracheostomy/possible pneumonia (CXR
 retrocardiac
   opacity), chronic steroid use.  Last diff 97 PMN / 1 lymph / 2 mono
   without bandemia. Continues to downtrend.  Found to have klebsiella
   UTI.  WBC increased after off cipro, added on differential.   Other Bcx
   are negative so far.  Started on vanc + cefepime empirically.  [**Month (only) 51**] have
   aspiration pneumonitis [**3-7**] event yesterday.  On appropriate therapy.
   - continue vanc + cefepime, 7 day course
   - redose vanc to 1g IV q24h
   - f/u cultures
   - continue abx
   - CXR shows no clear signs of infiltrate at this time
   .
   # Pseudoaneursym s/p repair: Vascular surgery is following. Hct
   initially trended down with repeat after two units from 29-31, but now
   stable.  U/S of R groin shows no evidence of continued aneurysm.  On
   [**12-3**], right groin site had increased swelling and hematoma, reeval for
   hematoma.
   - continuing to trend Hct, remaining stable, serial right leg exam,
   holding heparin
   - If suspect re-bleed, will R-CT of R leg, surgery onboard.
   - appropriate wound care, watch for infection.
   - pain control with oxycodone prn
 increased to q4h PRN
   - switched to PO pain rx now that she is able to swallow.
   - wound VAC was placed by vascular [**Doctor First Name 213**]
   - will f/u c Vsurg as outpatient
   .
   # LUE DVT
 provoked, likely [**3-7**] cordis.  Currently not on
   anticoagulation.
   - serial left arm exam given thrombus in brachial and cephalic vein,
   remains stable thus far
   - Serial measurement
   - No heparin after hematoma development on [**12-3**].
   .
   # UOP: Appeared to have mild contraction alkalosis with reduced UOP
   yesterday, responded to IVF bolus.
   - continue to monitor; IVF if clinically volume depleted on exam
   # A. tach: Curbside by EP yesterday suggested BB alone with no further
   management. Started metoprolol 25mg PO Q6H with good effect and no
   recurrence.
   - well controlled on metoprolol
   # delirium / agitation: Initially confused, likely [**3-7**] sundowning vs.
   infection vs. steroid-induced delirium vs. drug-induced (trazodone).
   Rheum agrees that likely due to steroid induced delirium.  Resolved at
   this time.
   - consider olanzapine and haldol as needed.
   - standing PM zydis if agitated
   - rheum c/s -  cont. chronic steroid dose, watch for steroid induced
   delirium
   # Valves: s/p balloon valvuloplasty with good effect. No signs of
   volume overload currently.
   -Continue ASA 81mg
   # RA: Con't prednisone.  Will need to discuss with rheumatology how to
   dose DMARDs as patient cannot receive POs currently and MTX cannot be
   given via NGT.
   - methotrexate with leucovorin
   - daily po prednisone
