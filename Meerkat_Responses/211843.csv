","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected cardiogenic shock. They have been unresponsive and nonverbal since admission. The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation throughout the night but maintained adequate mean arterial pressures. A transtracheal injection of lidocaine was given prior to nasal intubation, which successfully converted the patient from atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was started as a load dose. A swan-Ganz catheter was repositioned, and an oxygenation guidewire was placed to decompress the right ventricle. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation remained above 70%. Milrinone and dopamine infusions were increased. Lasix was started, and fluid balance was closely monitored. The patient's troponin T levels were negative, and creatine kinase levels were flat. Lactic acid levels were slightly elevated. There were no new changes in the review of systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
3. Respiratory complications: Due to mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation, the patient may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or"

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d and found to have 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] TTE with
   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation and
   cardioversion x1.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Suspect [**3-20**] MR given acute onset 5d ago and no
   known hx of MR, but given elevated RIGHT sided pressures there is some
   suggestion that this might be a chronic process. Depressed EF may be
   partially due to rhythm disturbance. Patient likely had chronic process
   that was exacerbated by several days of Aflutter that precipitated
   cardiogenic shock. CI improved up to 2.4. Warm extremities reassuring
   that shock is improving on Milrinone, Levophed and Dopamine. Failed
   cardioversion yesterday. LFTs improving but renal function unchanged
   suggesting possible component of ATN. Bordeline high temperatures
   likely reflect improving cardiogenic shock rather than sepsis. Elevated
   PA and PCWP with low pulmonary vascular resistance further support
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Try to d/c Dopamine today
   - Continue Milrinone
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: S/p 2 failed cardioversions. Patient did convert for
   some time yesterday, but did go back into flutter indicating that
   patient will likely require more improvement in volume status prior to
   being able to maintain NSR. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Plan to use lasix and diuril for goal I/O negative 500 cc to 1L. Will
   minimize IV intake as much as possible.
   - EP consult tomorrow re: possible need for ablation
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete.
   ASA 325
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**7-9**] peri-cardioversion. Hypoxic
   likely due to medication (ativan) and pulmonary edema. Since fluid
   status has not been improved will defer extubation for now. Became
   tachypnic with SBT today.
   - Continue PS ventilation 12/5
   .
   # Abdominal distention: KUB unremarkable. NG tube with mild to moderate
   output. [**Month (only) 11**] be functional ileus in setting of sepsis and depressive
   agents.
   - Continue NG to low suction
   .
   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver. LFTs improving. INR elevated but
   stable.
   .  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.
   .
   # ARF: Suspect ATN in setting of cariogenic shock as noted above. Since
   Cr has not improved with better hemodynamics, I assume more likely ATN
   - try to augment cardiac output.
   - renal dose meds
   - if worsens, will d/w renal
   # Hyponatremia: suspect [**3-20**] cardiogenic shock.  Total body up but renal
   perfusion low.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath over the past five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), along with hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intubation and cardioversion, but failed cardioversion yesterday. He is currently on multiple inotropic medications and diuretics for fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's elevated right-sided pressures and depressed ejection fraction suggest a chronic process that may have been exacerbated by atrial flutter. This condition can lead to decreased tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Atrial Flutter: Despite two failed cardioversions, the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm temporarily but then reverted back to atrial flutter. Further improvement in volume status is necessary before attempting to maintain normal sinus rhythm. The patient will continue on amiodarone and lasix for volume management.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: Although biomarkers are flat, there is a suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the patient's risk factors and symptoms. Further evaluation may be required.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and pulmonary edema. Extubation will be considered once the patient's fluid status"

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d and found to have 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] TTE with
   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation and
   cardioversion x1.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Suspect [**3-20**] MR given acute onset 5d ago and no
   known hx of MR, but given elevated RIGHT sided pressures there is some
   suggestion that this might be a chronic process. Depressed EF may be
   partially due to rhythm disturbance. Patient likely had chronic process
   that was exacerbated by several days of Aflutter that precipitated
   cardiogenic shock. CI improved up to 2.4. Warm extremities reassuring
   that shock is improving on Milrinone, Levophed and Dopamine. Failed
   cardioversion yesterday. LFTs improving but renal function unchanged
   suggesting possible component of ATN. Bordeline high temperatures
   likely reflect improving cardiogenic shock rather than sepsis. Elevated
   PA and PCWP with low pulmonary vascular resistance further support
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Try to d/c Dopamine today
   - Continue Milrinone
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will test bolus with
   Diuril 500 mg IVx1 this am.
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: S/p 2 failed cardioversions. Patient did convert for
   some time yesterday, but did go back into flutter indicating that
   patient will likely require more improvement in volume status prior to
   being able to maintain NSR. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Plan to use lasix and diuril for goal I/O negative 500 cc to 1L. Will
   minimize IV intake as much as possible.
   - EP consult tomorrow re: possible need for ablation
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete.
   ASA 325
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**7-9**] peri-cardioversion. Hypoxic
   likely due to medication (ativan) and pulmonary edema. Since fluid
   status has not been improved will defer extubation for now. Became
   tachypnic with SBT today.
   - Continue PS ventilation 12/5
   .
   # Abdominal distention: KUB unremarkable. NG tube with mild to moderate
   output. [**Month (only) 11**] be functional ileus in setting of sepsis and depressive
   agents.
   - Continue NG to low suction
   .
   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver. LFTs improving. INR elevated but
   stable.
   .  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.
   .
   # ARF: Suspect ATN in setting of cardiogenic shock as noted above.
   Since Cr has not improved with better hemodynamics, I assume more
   likely ATN
   - try to augment cardiac output.
   - renal dose meds
   - if worsens, will d/w renal
   # Hyponatremia: suspect [**3-20**] cardiogenic shock.  Total body up but renal
   perfusion low.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have significant mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and has been intubated and cardioverted once.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is suspected to have cardiogenic shock due to acute onset of MR and elevated right-sided pressures. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may be partially due to rhythm disturbance. The patient likely had a chronic process that was exacerbated by several days of atrial flutter, leading to cardiogenic shock.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient has been in atrial flutter and failed two cardioversions. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) is planned after improving the patient's volume status with Lasix and Diuril to help improve right atrial (RA) geometry. Amiodarone will be continued, and heparin gtt will also be continued.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: Biomarkers for coronary artery disease are flat, indicating no significant acute coronary syndrome.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has been since peri-cardioversion. Hypoxia is likely due to medication (ativan) and pulmonary edema. Since fluid status"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath over five days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography. The patient's hemodynamics were consistent with cardiogenic shock, and he underwent intubation and cardioversion.

The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing management focused on treating acute MR, supporting cardiac output, and addressing associated complications. He is currently in cardiogenic shock, likely due to severe MR, and has depressed global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without regional wall motion abnormality. Acute viral cardiomyopathy and cardiac tamponade have been ruled out.

The patient's tachycardia is believed to be compensatory, aiming to increase cardiac output. Inotropy is being provided using levophed, with titration based on urine output (UOP) and cardiac index (CI). If there is no improvement, alternative options will be considered. Nitroprusside may be used to improve left ventricular forward flow if afterload increases. Dobutamine may be considered if the heart rate slows. In case of hemodynamic instability or respiratory compromise, an urgent balloon pump may be discussed with the cardiology team.

The patient's cardiac valves are as previously described, with consideration given to transesophageal ech"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. The patient presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) over the past five days. Initial examination showed bibasilar rales and cool extremities, and a chest X-ray suggested acute congestive heart failure (CHF). Laboratory results indicated lactic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and elevated liver enzymes. An echocardiogram confirmed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR).

The differential diagnosis for the patient's SOB includes acute MR, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and tamponade. Non-cardiac causes such as infection with compensatory tachypnea or pulmonary embolus were also considered but deemed less likely.

The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation, and various treatments were initiated. These included levophed for inotropy, titrated based on urine output (UOP) and cardiac index (CI), nitroprusside to improve left ventricular forward flow if afterload increased, dobutamine if the heart rate slowed, and consideration of an urgent balloon pump if the patient remained hemodynamically unstable or experienced respiratory compromise.

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d.  Initial exam with bibasilar rales and cool
   extremities with CXR suggestive of acute CHF.  Labs with lactic
   acidosis, ARF, and elevated liver enzymes and echo c/w mod/severe MR.
   DDx of SOB broad but given above findings, cardiogenic shock is likely
   etiology.
   .
   # SOB: as above; likely from cardiogenic shock from ? acute MR.  DDx
   includes acute MR, tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, tamponade.  Non
   cardiac etiologies include infection with compensatory tachynpea,
   pulmonary embolus (possible given tachynpea, elevated CVP but unlikely
   to cause MR).  Provide supportive resp care and treat as below.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Suspect [**3-20**] MR given acute onset 5d ago and no
   known hx of MR.  Tachycardia likely compensatory to increase CO.  EF is
   depressed globally without regional wall motion abnl so less likely
   ACS.  Acute viral cardiomyopathy unlikely given lack of fevers, B sx.
   Tamponade unlikely given none seen on echo.
   - treat acute MR [**First Name (Titles) 1187**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6145**] tachycardia.  Will try levophed for
   inotropy and will titrate to changes in UOP and CI.  Reassess 1h after
   starting and if no improvement, will consider alternative options.
   - If afterload increases, will try nitroprusside to improve LV forward
   flow.
   - If heart rate slows, will try dobutamine
   - If hemodynamically unstable or resp compromise, will d/w cards team
   for consideration of urgent balloon pump
   .
   # Cards Valves: as above.  Await official read of echo in am.  Consider
   TEE.  If acute MR confirmed, will d/w cards and CT [**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Cards Pump: depressed globally.  augment as above
   .
   # Cards vasc: has delayed RWP on EKG but CE negative.
   - ASA 325
   - complete ROMI
   - consider eval of coronaries if goes to cath for balloon
   .
   # Cards rhythm: aflutter.  Will tolerate HR to 130 for increased CO.
   If rises and unstable, will do cardioversion.
   - hold nodal agents
   .
   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver vs congestion from cardiogenic
   shock.  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.  Will d/w liver c/s team
   .
   # ARF: Suspect prerenal from poor forward flow vs ATN from hypotension.
   - try to augment cardiac output.
   - check renal lytes
   - if worsens, will d/w renal
   .
   # ID: no clear source of infection.  Received ceftriaxone in ED.  Only
   small ascites so no para overnight.  Will culture elsewhere
   - hold abx
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: likely from lactate production.  Delta/delta -2
   so no non-gap.
   - check ABG and repeat lactate
   .
   # OSA: will do bipap if stable for sleep
   .
   # Psych: will confirm dosages of meds in am and restart then
   .
   # Hyponatremia: suspect [**3-20**] cardiogenic shock.  Total body up but renal
   perfusion low.
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) over five days and was initially found to have bibasilar rales and cool extremities. The chest X-ray suggested acute congestive heart failure (CHF). Lab results indicated lactic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and elevated liver enzymes. An echocardiogram confirmed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR). 

The differential diagnosis for SOB includes acute MR, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and tamponade. Non-cardiac causes such as infection and pulmonary embolus were also considered but less likely. The patient is currently receiving supportive respiratory care and being treated for cardiogenic shock, suspected due to severe MR. 

The plan includes treating acute MR, tachycardia, and assessing for potential interventions such as levophed for inotropy, nitroprusside for afterload reduction, and dobutamine if the heart rate slows. If the patient remains hemodynamically unstable or experiences respiratory compromise, an urgent balloon pump may be considered. 

Further evaluation of the patient's valves, cardiac pump function, and vascular status is planned. The patient's rhythm is currently atrial flutter, and efforts to control the heart rate are ongoing. Transaminitis, ARF,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d and found to have 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] TTE with
   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation and
   cardioversion x1.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Suspect [**3-20**] MR given acute onset 5d ago and no
   known hx of MR, but given elevated RIGHT sided pressures there is some
   suggestion that this might be a chronic process. Depressed EF may be
   partially due to rhythm disturbance. Patient likely had chronic process
   that was exacerbated by several days of Aflutter that precipitated
   cardiogenic shock. CI improved up to 2.4. Warm extremities reassuring
   that shock is improving on Milrinone, Levophed and Dopamine. Failed
   cardioversion yesterday. LFTs improving but renal function unchanged
   suggesting possible component of ATN. Bordeline high temperatures
   likely reflect improving cardiogenic shock rather than sepsis. Elevated
   PA and PCWP with low pulmonary vascular resistance further support
   cardiogenic shock.
   - Try to d/c Dopamine today
   - Continue Milrinone
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will test bolus with
   Diuril 500 mg IVx1 this am.
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: S/p 2 failed cardioversions. Patient did convert for
   some time yesterday, but did go back into flutter indicating that
   patient will likely require more improvement in volume status prior to
   being able to maintain NSR. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Plan to use lasix and diuril for goal I/O negative 500 cc to 1L. Will
   minimize IV intake as much as possible.
   - EP consult tomorrow re: possible need for ablation
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete.
   ASA 325
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**7-9**] peri-cardioversion. Hypoxic
   likely due to medication (ativan) and pulmonary edema. Since fluid
   status has not been improved will defer extubation for now. Became
   tachypnic with SBT today.
   - Continue PS ventilation 12/5
   .
   # Abdominal distention: KUB unremarkable. NG tube with mild to moderate
   output. [**Month (only) 11**] be functional ileus in setting of sepsis and depressive
   agents.
   - Continue NG to low suction
   .
   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver. LFTs improving. INR elevated but
   stable.
   .  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.
   .
   # ARF: Suspect ATN in setting of cardiogenic shock as noted above.
   Since Cr has not improved with better hemodynamics, I assume more
   likely ATN
   - try to augment cardiac output.
   - renal dose meds
   - if worsens, will d/w renal
   # Hyponatremia: suspect [**3-20**] cardiogenic shock.  Total body up but renal
   perfusion low.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath over the past five days and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiography. The patient underwent intubation and cardioversion.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have cardiogenic shock due to acute onset MR and no known history of MR. The patient's right-sided pressures suggest a chronic process. A depressed ejection fraction may be partially due to rhythm disturbance. The patient likely had a chronic process that was exacerbated by several days of atrial flutter, leading to cardiogenic shock. The cardiac index improved up to 2.4, indicating improving shock status with the use of milrinone, levophed, and dopamine. Failed cardioversion yesterday. Liver function tests are improving, but renal function remains unchanged, suggesting possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Borderline high temperatures are likely reflecting improving cardiogenic shock rather than sepsis. Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with low pulmonary vascular resistance further support cardiogenic shock.

Plan:
1. Try to discontinue dopamine today.
2. Continue milrinone.
3. Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will test bolus with Diuril 500 mg IVx1 this"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock. He underwent intubation and cardioversion once. The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial flutter, fluid overload, respiratory failure, abdominal distention, transaminitis, acute renal failure (ARF), and fasting state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition suggests cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by poor tissue perfusion and hypotension due to impaired cardiac function. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's EKG shows sinus tachycardia, which may mask atrial flutter. Atrial flutter can lead to irregular heart rhythm and reduce cardiac output, further compromising the patient's hemodynamic status.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating fluid overload. If not addressed, this can lead to electrolyte imbalances, increased preload, and worsen heart failure symptoms.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. If the patient"

   well as restrictive LV filling suggestive of diastolic dysfunction.
   Fick values over the past 24 hours:
   1PM (pre-IABP): CI=1.8; CO=4.3; SVR=1100; SvO2=57; Hb=12.2
   6PM (post-IABP): CI=2.1; CO=4.9; SVR=925; SvO2=61
   10PM: CI=2.5; CO=5.9; SVR=____; SvO2=67
   Increased milrinone to 0.5. IABP placed yesterday, at 1:1 with MAPs in
   80s.
   Urine output has been 150-300cc per hour in last 24 hours.
   CXR looks stable in terms of pulmonary congestion.
   Plan: continue balloon pump 1:1, milrinon at 0.5. HR is controlled in
   80-90s, but if 110s then we can consider BB to better fill
   diastolically. Continue to follow CI and diuresis, goal -2L. While
   providing supportive care, continue to investigate etiology. Sent ESR,
   [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, ... could be tachy, could be valvular disease, will
   discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] about cardiac transplant, will call liver team
   pre-transplant.
   Cardiomyopathy workup to date includes [**First Name (STitle) **] (MR 3+), cath (clean
   coronaries), ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, iron studies.
   The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are vast,
   including: ischemic, tachycardia-induced, valvular, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, other viral and non-viral), substance
   abuse (alcohol, cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP,
   UPEP], hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin, ?seroquel). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time,
   work-up will turn out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]). He is
   probably too unstable for endomyocardial biopsy. Will investigate these
   etiologies as appropriate.
   For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver consult.
   His MR is likely chronic, not acute, because his PCWP was 48 (which is
   more elevated than expected in a healthy person with acute MR). This
   indicates a possibility of chronic CMP?
   ## RHYTHM: He is in sinus rhythm now, on amiodarone. He did not get
   cardioverted in the lab today
   He is on lasix 15
   Amiodarone to keep him in sinus rhythm. Will complete load of 10g, then
   we can taper down... Calculate how much he got it (as of 6PM he got
   900mg, when he wakes up he can get high dose PO). Then 200mg PO bid
   when he wakes up and the loading is done.
   In the cath lab, he had carotid massage which slowed his HR. His
   responsiveness to this vasovagal maneuver indicates his tachyarrhythmia
   was less likely a-flutter. His increased HR was more likely physiologic
   response to cardiogenic shock,
   His a-flutter from the day before seemed to convert into a
   tachyarrhythmia after the dopamine was weaned off, which makes sense
   because dopamine has beta-adrenergic effect.
   His HR is better now because of the balloon pump. His tachyacardia was
   physiology ic because of the shock. Now wit hthe balloon the
   hemodynamics are better, so his HR is lower.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   [**Name6 (MD) 1030**] the RN was switching from propofol to fentanyl/versed, the
   patient became apneic. He was placed on assist control. *If overnight
   he overbreathes the vent settings, then we can switch him to PS in the
   morning. If he does not overbreath the vent, then we can wean sedation
   in the morning around rounds time, and wean the AC to minimal settings,
   and give him a ""breathing trial."" If he has spontaenous breaths, we can
   place him on PS again.
   NOTE:
   You can catually terminate v-tach with carotid massage.
   # ELEVATED PAP
   - it is contraindication to heart transplant if it is primary.
   - The etiology is still in the works. If it is due to CHF, we would
   expect these values to get better as he is now on increased milrinone
   and on the balloon pump.
   - h/o OSA, which could be etiology

   # Cardiogenic shock:: CI drifting down to 1.9 from 2.4 yesterday likely
   due to reduced tachycardia and elevated MAPs.  Interestingly MAPs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction, restrictive left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock. He has undergone intubation, cardioversion, cardiac catheterization (clean coronaries), and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (CHF consult) requested cardiac cath to eval for CAD due to
   concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cath showed clean coronaries so
   heparin was restarted. Carotid massage during cath suggested sinus
   tachycardia more likely than atrial tachycardia, so cardioversion was
   deemed unnecessary. To increase CI, IABP was placed.
   - Apnic yesterday in setting of switching from Propofol to
   Fentanyl/versed, required switching to assist control ventilation
   - [**First Name (STitle) **] - Mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
   Restrictive left ventricular filling pattern suggestive of severe
   diastolic dysfunction. RV is dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. Normal aortic valve. 3 + MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] htn.
   - Work up started for cardiomyopathy. C. Cath as above. Also added

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.
        The patient has been in cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   requiring milrinone at 0.5 and IABP at 1:1 to maintain CI in the
   2.1-2.5 range and SvO2 in low 60s (goal CI>2.5, SvO2>70). MAPs have
   been stable in the 80s (goal >65) and [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25%. His
   CI/SvO2 are improving, but we will need to see more improvement if we
   are to wean his IABP. He has had great urine output (150-300cc per
   hour) on diuril bolus x1 and lasix gtt. CXR looks stable in terms of
   pulmonary congestion. We will plan to continue milrinone at 0.5 and
   IABP at 1:1 with goal CI>2.5. Goal I/O will be even because he likely
   has contraction alkalosis, so we will d/c lasix gtt if UOP remains
   high.
        While providing supportive care, we continue to investigate
   etiology. The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are
   vast, including: ischemic, valvular, tachycardia-induced, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, and others), substance abuse (alcohol,
   cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP, UPEP],
   hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time, work-up will turn
   out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]).
        Cardiomyopathy workup to date makes valvular and ischemic
   etiologies unlikely causes of his cardiomyopathy:
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram showed 3+ mitral regurgitation, which
   raised the possibility that his cardiomyopathy is secondary to mitral
   valve disease. However, further examination revealed that the mitral
   valve annulus is increased in diameter, which suggests that mitral
   regurgitation developed secondary to the dilated ventricle.
   Furthermore, his PCWP on admission was 48, which is too high suggest
   acute MR.
   - Regional hypokinesis on [**Year (4 digits) **] suggested that the patient may have
   ischemic disease resulting in regional infarction of cardiac tissue.
   However, cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries, making
   ischemic etiology very unlikely.
        Although an infiltrative process is less likely because he does
   not have a restrictive pattern of cardiac disease, we are still
   investigating this possibility because the causes could be reversible.
   These include: ESR/[**Doctor First Name **] to investigate for sarcoidosis and SLE and giant
   cell arteritis, SPEP/UPEP for amyloidosis (although these could still
   be negative if amyloidosis is primarily cardiac), RF for rheumatoid
   cardiac disease, and iron studies for hemochromatosis.
        For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver evaluation.
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will facilitate.

        He is in sinus rhythm now, on amiodarone load with goal to get to

   # CORONARIES.
        Clean per cath.
   .
   # ACID-BASE IMBALANCE.
        A contraction alkalosis occurs when there is loss of relatively
   large volumes of bicarbonate-free fluid, and IV loop diuretics which
   induce large fluid diuresis commonly cause contraction alkalosis (see
   [**Doctor Last Name 6257**] et [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Intern Med [**2080**], and [**Doctor First Name 1885**] et [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**2092**]).
   Because our patient diuresed over 3L yesterday and even more the days
   before, contraction metabolic alkalosis [**3-20**] lasix/diuril is the most
   likely explanation for his high HCO3. However, the patient
s ABG
   revealed a high PaCO2 of 60 this morning, which suggests there is a
   compensatory respiratory acidosis. In addition, there must be at least
   some component of a primary respiratory acidosis because his pH was
   7.35 this AM. Still, his vent settings will need to have a low rate and
   maintain that respiratory acidosis because it is mostly compensatory.
   Giving IVF at this time would be counter-productive given his clinical
   picture, but giving K+ would help correct his acid-base imbalance
   because he would waste less H+ in his urine.

   because he needs respiratory acidosis to correct for metabolic
   alkalosis, we will bring his rate down to 16.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction, restrictive left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate global right ventricular hypokinesis. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and has been intubated, cardioverted, and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate in the range of 113-121 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 97/76 to 116/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals a pH of 7.35, elevated pCO2, normal pO2, and increased HCO3-.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including cardiogenic shock, rhythm disturbances, acid-base imbalance, respiratory failure, fever, transaminitis, acute renal failure (ATN), and potential infections. It is important to"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   1. shock
   2. rhythm. flutter resolved with amio and diuresis. loaded up amio 300
   in the cath lab, cont on amio drip, appears in sinus. Goal HR 80-90 to
   augment filling pressures. ?start BB.
   3. coronaries - clean
   4. respiratory failure. intubated for airway protection. to extubate,
   goal diuresed and MS stable. He needs to be still for the balloon pump,
   so keep on fentanyl/versed.
   5. ARF.
   6. Pre-transplant evaluation.
   7. Trans-aminitis
   8. NG-tube clamped
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. The patient has cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   low CI and high SVR. [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25% (systolic dysfunction) as
   well as restrictive LV filling suggestive of diastolic dysfunction.
   Fick values over the past 24 hours:
   1PM (pre-IABP): CI=1.8; CO=4.3; SVR=1100; SvO2=57; Hb=12.2
   6PM (post-IABP): CI=2.1; CO=4.9; SVR=925; SvO2=61
   10PM: CI=2.5; CO=5.9; SVR=____; SvO2=67
   Increased milrinone to 0.5. IABP placed yesterday, at 1:1 with MAPs in
   80s.
   Urine output has been 150-300cc per hour in last 24 hours.
   CXR looks stable in terms of pulmonary congestion.
   Plan: continue balloon pump 1:1, milrinon at 0.5. HR is controlled in
   80-90s, but if 110s then we can consider BB to better fill
   diastolically. Continue to follow CI and diuresis, goal -2L. While
   providing supportive care, continue to investigate etiology. Sent ESR,
   [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, ... could be tachy, could be valvular disease, will
   discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] about cardiac transplant, will call liver team
   pre-transplant.
   Cardiomyopathy workup to date includes [**First Name (STitle) **] (MR 3+), cath (clean
   coronaries), ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, iron studies.
   The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are vast,
   including: ischemic, tachycardia-induced, valvular, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, other viral and non-viral), substance
   abuse (alcohol, cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP,
   UPEP], hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin, ?seroquel). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time,
   work-up will turn out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]). He is
   probably too unstable for endomyocardial biopsy. Will investigate these
   etiologies as appropriate.
   For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver consult.
   His MR is likely chronic, not acute, because his PCWP was 48 (which is
   more elevated than expected in a healthy person with acute MR).
   ## RHYTHM: He is in sinus rhythm now, on amiodarone. He did not get
   cardioverted in the lab today
   He is on lasix 15
   Amiodarone to keep him in sinus rhythm. Will complete load of 10g, then
   we can taper down... Calculate how much he got it (as of 6PM he got
   900mg, when he wakes up he can get high dose PO). Then 200mg PO bid
   when he wakes up and the loading is done.
   In the cath lab, he had carotid massage which slowed his HR. His
   responsiveness to this vasovagal maneuver indicates his tachyarrhythmia
   was less likely a-flutter. His increased HR was more likely physiologic
   response to cardiogenic shock,
   His a-flutter from the day before seemed to convert into a
   tachyarrhythmia after the dopamine was weaned off, which makes sense
   because dopamine has beta-adrenergic effect.
   His HR is better now because of the balloon pump. His tachyacardia was
   physiology ic because of the shock. Now wit hthe balloon the
   hemodynamics are better, so his HR is lower.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   [**Name6 (MD) 1030**] the RN was switching from propofol to fentanyl/versed, the
   patient became apneic. He was placed on assist control. *If overnight
   he overbreathes the vent settings, then we can switch him to PS in the
   morning. If he does not overbreath the vent, then we can wean sedation
   in the morning around rounds time, and wean the AC to minimal settings,
   and give him a ""breathing trial."" If he has spontaenous breaths, we can
   place him on PS again.
   NOTE:
   You can catually terminate v-tach with carotid massage.
   # ELEVATED PAP
   - it is contraindication to heart transplant if it is primary.
   - The etiology is still in the works. If it is due to CHF, we would
   expect these values to get better as he is now on increased milrinone
   and on the balloon pump.
   - h/o OSA, which could be etiology
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock:: CI drifting down to 1.9 from 2.4 yesterday likely
   due to reduced tachycardia and elevated MAPs.  Interestingly MAPs
   higher since dopamine stopped yesterday. Elevated PA and PCWP with low
   pulmonary vascular resistance further support cardiogenic shock.
   - Increase Milrinone  to 2.5 to reduce MAPs and impove ionotropy
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will bolus with Diuril
   500 mg IVx1 this am after such good response yesterday.
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   - Repeat [**Name6 (MD) **] today
   - Complete Cardiomyopathy work up
   - CHF consult today
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: EKG c/w Sinus tach this am. Appeared to convert after
   dopamine stopped yesterday. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry.
   - Continue Amiodarone. Patient 900 mg into load as of 6 pm last night.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Plan to use lasix and diuril for goal I/O negative 1 L.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 6202**] EP consult for now
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete.
   - ASA 325
   - Will need cath prior to dispo to eval for ischemic cardiomyopathy
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**7-9**] peri-cardioversion. Fluid status
   improved.
   - Continue PS ventilation 12/5 will defer Extubation until tomorrow in
   case of cath today
   .
   # Abdominal distention: KUB unremarkable. NG output more bilious. Hct
   stable.
   - Clamp NG tube
   .
   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver. LFTs improving. INR elevated but
   stable.
   .  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.
   .
   # ARF: Suspect ATN in setting of cardiogenic shock as noted above.
   Since Cr has not improved with better hemodynamics, I assume more
   likely ATN
   - try to augment cardiac output.
   - renal dose meds
   - if worsens, will d/w renal
   # FEN: NPO for now.  No TFs given NG output. Will trial TFs if clamped

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath and was found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction, restrictive left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with low cardiac index (CI) and high systemic vascular resistance (SVR). He has been intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), and elevated pulmonary artery pressures.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low CI and high SVR indicate cardiogenic shock. This is further supported by elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient initially had atrial flutter, which converted into sinus tachycardia. He is currently on amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to airway protection during cardioversion and subsequent respiratory failure. He is currently on assist-control ventilation with plans for weaning.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI, likely due to cardiogenic shock. His renal function needs to be monitored closely.
5. Elevated Pulmonary Artery Pressures (PAP): The patient's P"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   1. shock
   2. rhythm. flutter resolved with amio and diuresis. loaded up amio 300
   in the cath lab, cont on amio drip, appears in sinus. Goal HR 80-90 to
   augment filling pressures. ?start BB.
   3. coronaries - clean
   4. respiratory failure. intubated for airway protection. to extubate,
   goal diuresed and MS stable. He needs to be still for the balloon pump,
   so keep on fentanyl/versed.
   5. ARF.
   6. Pre-transplant evaluation.
   7. Trans-aminitis
   8. NG-tube clamped
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. The patient has cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   low CI and high SVR. [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25% (systolic dysfunction) as
   well as restrictive LV filling suggestive of diastolic dysfunction.
   Fick values over the past 24 hours:
   1PM (pre-IABP): CI=1.8; CO=4.3; SVR=1100; SvO2=57; Hb=12.2
   6PM (post-IABP): CI=2.1; CO=4.9; SVR=925; SvO2=61
   10PM: CI=2.5; CO=5.9; SVR=____; SvO2=67
   Increased milrinone to 0.5. IABP placed yesterday, at 1:1 with MAPs in
   80s.
   Urine output has been 150-300cc per hour in last 24 hours.
   CXR looks stable in terms of pulmonary congestion.
   Plan: continue balloon pump 1:1, milrinon at 0.5. HR is controlled in
   80-90s, but if 110s then we can consider BB to better fill
   diastolically. Continue to follow CI and diuresis, goal -2L. While
   providing supportive care, continue to investigate etiology. Sent ESR,
   [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, ... could be tachy, could be valvular disease, will
   discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] about cardiac transplant, will call liver team
   pre-transplant.
   Cardiomyopathy workup to date includes [**First Name (STitle) **] (MR 3+), cath (clean
   coronaries), ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, iron studies.
   The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are vast,
   including: ischemic, tachycardia-induced, valvular, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, other viral and non-viral), substance
   abuse (alcohol, cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP,
   UPEP], hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin, ?seroquel). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time,
   work-up will turn out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]). He is
   probably too unstable for endomyocardial biopsy. Will investigate these
   etiologies as appropriate.
   For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver consult.
   His MR is likely chronic, not acute, because his PCWP was 48 (which is
   more elevated than expected in a healthy person with acute MR).
   ## RHYTHM: He is in sinus rhythm now, on amiodarone. He did not get
   cardioverted in the lab today
   He is on lasix 15
   Amiodarone to keep him in sinus rhythm. Will complete load of 10g, then
   we can taper down... Calculate how much he got it (as of 6PM he got
   900mg, when he wakes up he can get high dose PO). Then 200mg PO bid
   when he wakes up and the loading is done.
   In the cath lab, he had carotid massage which slowed his HR. His
   responsiveness to this vasovagal maneuver indicates his tachyarrhythmia
   was less likely a-flutter. His increased HR was more likely physiologic
   response to cardiogenic shock,
   His a-flutter from the day before seemed to convert into a
   tachyarrhythmia after the dopamine was weaned off, which makes sense
   because dopamine has beta-adrenergic effect.
   His HR is better now because of the balloon pump. His tachyacardia was
   physiology ic because of the shock. Now wit hthe balloon the
   hemodynamics are better, so his HR is lower.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   [**Name6 (MD) 1030**] the RN was switching from propofol to fentanyl/versed, the
   patient became apneic. He was placed on assist control. *If overnight
   he overbreathes the vent settings, then we can switch him to PS in the
   morning. If he does not overbreath the vent, then we can wean sedation
   in the morning around rounds time, and wean the AC to minimal settings,
   and give him a ""breathing trial."" If he has spontaenous breaths, we can
   place him on PS again.
   NOTE:
   You can catually terminate v-tach with carotid massage.
   # ELEVATED PAP
   - it is contraindication to heart transplant if it is primary.
   - The etiology is still in the works. If it is due to CHF, we would
   expect these values to get better as he is now on increased milrinone
   and on the balloon pump.
   - h/o OSA, which could be etiology
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock:: CI drifting down to 1.9 from 2.4 yesterday likely
   due to reduced tachycardia and elevated MAPs.  Interestingly MAPs
   higher since dopamine stopped yesterday. Elevated PA and PCWP with low
   pulmonary vascular resistance further support cardiogenic shock.
   - Increase Milrinone  to 2.5 to reduce MAPs and impove ionotropy
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will bolus with Diuril
   500 mg IVx1 this am after such good response yesterday.
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   - Repeat [**Name6 (MD) **] today
   - Complete Cardiomyopathy work up
   - CHF consult today
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: EKG c/w Sinus tach this am. Appeared to convert after
   dopamine stopped yesterday. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry.
   - Continue Amiodarone. Patient 900 mg into load as of 6 pm last night.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Plan to use lasix and diuril for goal I/O negative 1 L.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 6202**] EP consult for now
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete.
   - ASA 325
   - Will need cath prior to dispo to eval for ischemic cardiomyopathy
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**7-9**] peri-cardioversion. Fluid status
   improved.
   - Continue PS ventilation 12/5 will defer Extubation until tomorrow in
   case of cath today
   .
   # Abdominal distention: KUB unremarkable. NG output more bilious. Hct
   stable.
   - Clamp NG tube

   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver. LFTs improving. INR elevated but
   stable.
   .  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.
   .
   # ARF: Suspect ATN in setting of cardiogenic shock as noted above.
   Since Cr has not improved with better hemodynamics, I assume more
   likely ATN
   - try to augment cardiac output.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock due to severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. This condition requires immediate medical intervention to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics and improve cardiac output.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, which may be a result of fluid overload, metabolic alkalosis, or underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome (OSA). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to assess the effectiveness of ventilatory support and consider extubation once stable.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or cardiorenal syndrome. Ongoing monitoring of renal function and appropriate management to support kidney function are essential.

4. Abdominal Distention: The patient presents with abdominal distention, which may be caused by bowel obstruction or ileus. Further evaluation, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, can help identify the underlying cause. If necessary, appropriate interventions can be implemented to relieve the distention.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggestive of transaminitis. This could be a result of shock liver or other underlying liver pathology. Monitoring of liver function tests and appropriate management based"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (CHF consult) requested cardiac cath to eval for CAD due to
   concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cath showed clean coronaries so
   heparin was restarted. Carotid massage during cath suggested sinus
   tachycardia more likely than atrial tachycardia, so cardioversion was
   deemed unnecessary. To increase CI, IABP was placed.
   - Apnic yesterday in setting of switching from Propofol to
   Fentanyl/versed, required switching to assist control ventilation
   - [**First Name (STitle) **] - Mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. The patient has cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   hemodynamic instability and requiring milrinone at 0.5 and IABP at 1:1
   to maintain CI, and CI is still not even within normal limits.
   [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25% (systolic dysfunction) and restrictive LV
   filling (diastolic dysfunction), as well as 3+ mitral regurgitation.
   Fick values over the past 24 hours indicate that his CI is improving on
   increased dose of milrinone and the placement of his IABP at 1:1 (1PM
   yesterday CI=1.8, SvO2=57, by 5AM today CI=2.2, SvO2=63):
   Increased milrinone to 0.5. IABP placed yesterday, at 1:1 with MAPs in
   80s.
   Urine output has been 150-300cc per hour in last 24 hours.
   CXR looks stable in terms of pulmonary congestion.
   Plan: continue balloon pump 1:1, milrinon at 0.5. HR is controlled in
   80-90s, but if 110s then we can consider BB to better fill
   diastolically. Continue to follow CI and diuresis, goal -2L. While
   providing supportive care, continue to investigate etiology. Sent ESR,
   [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, ... could be tachy, could be valvular disease, will
   discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] about cardiac transplant, will call liver team
   pre-transplant.
   Cardiomyopathy workup to date includes [**First Name (STitle) **] (MR 3+), cath (clean
   coronaries), ESR, [**Doctor First Name **], RF, spep/upep, iron studies.
   The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are vast,
   including: ischemic, tachycardia-induced, valvular, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, other viral and non-viral), substance
   abuse (alcohol, cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP,
   UPEP], hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin, ?seroquel). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time,
   work-up will turn out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]). He is
   probably too unstable for endomyocardial biopsy. Will investigate these
   etiologies as appropriate.
   For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver consult.
   His MR is likely chronic, not acute, because his PCWP was 48 (which is
   more elevated than expected in a healthy person with acute MR).
   ## RHYTHM: He is in sinus rhythm now, on amiodarone. He did not get
   cardioverted in the lab today
   He is on lasix 15
   Amiodarone to keep him in sinus rhythm. Will complete load of 10g, then
   we can taper down... Calculate how much he got it (as of 6PM he got
   900mg, when he wakes up he can get high dose PO). Then 200mg PO bid
   when he wakes up and the loading is done.
   In the cath lab, he had carotid massage which slowed his HR. His
   responsiveness to this vasovagal maneuver indicates his tachyarrhythmia
   was less likely a-flutter. His increased HR was more likely physiologic
   response to cardiogenic shock,
   His a-flutter from the day before seemed to convert into a
   tachyarrhythmia after the dopamine was weaned off, which makes sense
   because dopamine has beta-adrenergic effect.
   His HR is better now because of the balloon pump. His tachyacardia was
   physiology ic because of the shock. Now wit hthe balloon the
   hemodynamics are better, so his HR is lower.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   [**Name6 (MD) 1030**] the RN was switching from propofol to fentanyl/versed, the
   patient became apneic. He was placed on assist control. *If overnight
   he overbreathes the vent settings, then we can switch him to PS in the
   morning. If he does not overbreath the vent, then we can wean sedation
   in the morning around rounds time, and wean the AC to minimal settings,
   and give him a ""breathing trial."" If he has spontaenous breaths, we can
   place him on PS again.
   NOTE:
   You can catually terminate v-tach with carotid massage.
   # ELEVATED PAP
   - it is contraindication to heart transplant if it is primary.
   - The etiology is still in the works. If it is due to CHF, we would
   expect these values to get better as he is now on increased milrinone
   and on the balloon pump.
   - h/o OSA, which could be etiology
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock:: CI drifting down to 1.9 from 2.4 yesterday likely
   due to reduced tachycardia and elevated MAPs.  Interestingly MAPs
   higher since dopamine stopped yesterday. Elevated PA and PCWP with low
   pulmonary vascular resistance further support cardiogenic shock.
   - Increase Milrinone  to 2.5 to reduce MAPs and impove ionotropy
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will bolus with Diuril
   500 mg IVx1 this am after such good response yesterday.
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   - Repeat [**Name6 (MD) **] today
   - Complete Cardiomyopathy work up
   - CHF consult today

   # Atrial Flutter: EKG c/w Sinus tach this am. Appeared to convert after
   dopamine stopped yesterday. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry.
   - Continue Amiodarone. Patient 900 mg into load as of 6 pm last night.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for the patient:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by hemodynamic instability and the need for inotropic support with milrinone and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's low cardiac index (CI) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) indicate inadequate tissue perfusion. It is crucial to continue optimizing the patient's hemodynamics and monitoring for any signs of worsening shock.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, which occurred during the transition from propofol to fentanyl/versed. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary, and adjustments to the ventilator settings may be required. Extubation will depend on the patient's ability to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation.

3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Given the setting of cardiogenic shock, ATN is a likely cause of the patient's renal dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's renal function and adjust fluid and medication management accordingly.

4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be indicative of hepatic dysfunction. This could be secondary to shock liver or other underlying conditions. Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFT"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (CHF consult) requested cardiac cath to eval for CAD due to
   concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cath showed clean coronaries so
   heparin was restarted. Carotid massage during cath suggested sinus
   tachycardia more likely than atrial tachycardia, so cardioversion was
   deemed unnecessary. To increase CI, IABP was placed.
   - Apnic yesterday in setting of switching from Propofol to
   Fentanyl/versed, required switching to assist control ventilation
   - [**First Name (STitle) **] - Mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated.

   requiring milrinone at 0.5 and IABP at 1:1 to maintain CI in the
   2.1-2.5 range and SvO2 in low 60s (goal CI>2.5, SvO2>70). MAPs have
   been stable in the 80s (goal >65) and [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25%. His
   CI/SvO2 are improving, but we will need to see more improvement if we
   are to wean his IABP. He has had great urine output (150-300cc per
   hour) on diuril bolus x1 and lasix gtt. CXR looks stable in terms of
   pulmonary congestion. We will plan to continue milrinone at 0.5 and
   IABP at 1:1 with goal CI>2.5. Goal I/O will be even because he likely
   has contraction alkalosis, so we will d/c lasix gtt if UOP remains
   high.
        While providing supportive care, we continue to investigate
   etiology. The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are
   vast, including: ischemic, valvular, tachycardia-induced, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, and others), substance abuse (alcohol,
   cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP, UPEP],
   hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time, work-up will turn
   out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]).
        Cardiomyopathy workup to date makes valvular and ischemic
   etiologies unlikely causes of his cardiomyopathy:
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram showed 3+ mitral regurgitation, which
   raised the possibility that his cardiomyopathy is secondary to mitral
   valve disease. However, further examination revealed that the mitral
   valve annulus is increased in diameter, which suggests that mitral
   regurgitation developed secondary to the dilated ventricle.
   Furthermore, his PCWP on admission was 48, which is too high suggest
   acute MR.
   - Regional hypokinesis on [**Year (4 digits) **] suggested that the patient may have
   ischemic disease resulting in regional infarction of cardiac tissue.
   However, cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries, making
   ischemic etiology very unlikely.
        Although an infiltrative process is less likely because he does
   not have a restrictive pattern of cardiac disease, we are still
   investigating this possibility because the causes could be reversible.
   These include: ESR/[**Doctor First Name **] to investigate for sarcoidosis and SLE and giant
   cell arteritis, SPEP/UPEP for amyloidosis (although these could still
   be negative if amyloidosis is primarily cardiac), RF for rheumatoid
   cardiac disease, and iron studies for hemochromatosis.
        For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver evaluation.
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will facilitate.

   # RHYTHM.
        He is in sinus rhythm now, on amiodarone load with goal to get to

   # CORONARIES.

   # ACID-BASE IMBALANCE.
        The patient has metabolic alkalosis with compensatory respiratory
   acidosis based on high HCO3 and high PaCO2. This is most likely
   contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis, because in the
   process H+ is lost in the urine. Although we could give fluid to
   correct this imbalance,

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression who presented with increasing shortness of breath over the past five days. He was found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction, restrictive left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock, and he required intubation, cardioversion, cardiac catheterization (clean coronaries), and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is intubated and on assist control ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.9 x 109/L, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 282 x 109/L, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 120 mg/dL, lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L, and a pH of 7.35. The patient has metabolic alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is already in cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by his dependence on IABP and milrinone to maintain cardiac index (CI) in the 2.1-2.5 range and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) in the low 60s. It will be necessary to continue milrinone and IABP support and monitor for further improvement in CI and SvO2.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation due to respiratory failure. His respiratory status is compromised by volume overload and metabolic alkalosis. It will be important to monitor his I/O status and correct any fluid imbalances. Weaning off the ventilator may be considered once his respiratory function improves and his volume status is optimized.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine has been elevated, and he may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Monitoring his renal function and providing appropriate supportive care, including renal-dose medications, will be important.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate transaminitis. This could be secondary"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (CHF consult) requested cardiac cath to eval for CAD due to
   concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cath showed clean coronaries so
   heparin was restarted. Carotid massage during cath suggested sinus
   tachycardia more likely than atrial tachycardia, so cardioversion was
   deemed unnecessary. To increase CI, IABP was placed.
   - Apnic yesterday in setting of switching from Propofol to
   Fentanyl/versed, required switching to assist control ventilation

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.
        The patient has been in cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   requiring milrinone at 0.5 and IABP at 1:1 to maintain CI in the
   2.1-2.5 range and SvO2 in low 60s (goal CI>2.5, SvO2>70). MAPs have
   been stable in the 80s (goal >65) and [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25%. His
   CI/SvO2 are improving, but we will need to see more improvement if we
   are to wean his IABP. He has had great urine output (150-300cc per
   hour) on diuril bolus x1 and lasix gtt. CXR looks stable in terms of
   pulmonary congestion. We will plan to continue milrinone at 0.5 and
   IABP at 1:1 with goal CI>2.5. Goal I/O will be even because he likely
   has contraction alkalosis, so we will d/c lasix gtt if UOP remains
   high.
        While providing supportive care, we continue to investigate
   etiology. The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are
   vast, including: ischemic, valvular, tachycardia-induced, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, and others), substance abuse (alcohol,
   cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP, UPEP],
   hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time, work-up will turn
   out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]).
        Cardiomyopathy workup to date makes valvular and ischemic
   etiologies unlikely causes of his cardiomyopathy:
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram showed 3+ mitral regurgitation, which
   raised the possibility that his cardiomyopathy is secondary to mitral
   valve disease. However, further examination revealed that the mitral
   valve annulus is increased in diameter, which suggests that mitral
   regurgitation developed secondary to the dilated ventricle.
   Furthermore, his PCWP on admission was 48, which is too high suggest
   acute MR.
   - Regional hypokinesis on [**Year (4 digits) **] suggested that the patient may have
   ischemic disease resulting in regional infarction of cardiac tissue.
   However, cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries, making
   ischemic etiology very unlikely.
        Although an infiltrative process is less likely because he does
   not have a restrictive pattern of cardiac disease, we are still
   investigating this possibility because the causes could be reversible.
   These include: ESR/[**Doctor First Name **] to investigate for sarcoidosis and SLE and giant
   cell arteritis, SPEP/UPEP for amyloidosis (although these could still
   be negative if amyloidosis is primarily cardiac), RF for rheumatoid
   cardiac disease, and iron studies for hemochromatosis.
        For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver evaluation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath over five days and was found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction, restrictive left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate global right ventricular hypokinesis. The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock, and he has been intubated, cardioverted, and undergone cardiac catheterization (clean coronaries), with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by the need for milrinone and IABP to maintain cardiac index (CI) in the range of 2.1-2.5 and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) in the low 60s. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) has been stable in the 80s, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 20-25%. CI/SvO2 are improving, but we will need to see more improvement if we are to wean his IABP.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on a ventilator on assist control mode. Rate was increased to 20 this morning and improved his acid-base status. However, because he needs respiratory acidosis to correct for metabolic alkal"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (CHF consult) requested cardiac cath to eval for CAD due to
   concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cath showed clean coronaries so
   heparin was restarted. Carotid massage during cath suggested sinus
   tachycardia more likely than atrial tachycardia, so cardioversion was
   deemed unnecessary. To increase CI, IABP was placed.
   - Apnic yesterday in setting of switching from Propofol to

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.
        The patient has been in cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   requiring milrinone at 0.5 and IABP at 1:1 to maintain CI in the
   2.1-2.5 range and SvO2 in low 60s (goal CI>2.5, SvO2>70). MAPs have
   been stable in the 80s (goal >65) and [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25%. His
   CI/SvO2 are improving, but we will need to see more improvement if we
   are to wean his IABP. He has had great urine output (150-300cc per
   hour) on diuril bolus x1 and lasix gtt. CXR looks stable in terms of
   pulmonary congestion. We will plan to continue milrinone at 0.5 and
   IABP at 1:1 with goal CI>2.5. Goal I/O will be even because he likely
   has contraction alkalosis, so we will d/c lasix gtt if UOP remains
   high.
        While providing supportive care, we continue to investigate
   etiology. The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are
   vast, including: ischemic, valvular, tachycardia-induced, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, and others), substance abuse (alcohol,
   cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP, UPEP],
   hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time, work-up will turn
   out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]).
        Cardiomyopathy workup to date makes valvular and ischemic
   etiologies unlikely causes of his cardiomyopathy:
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram showed 3+ mitral regurgitation, which
   raised the possibility that his cardiomyopathy is secondary to mitral
   valve disease. However, further examination revealed that the mitral
   valve annulus is increased in diameter, which suggests that mitral
   regurgitation developed secondary to the dilated ventricle.
   Furthermore, his PCWP on admission was 48, which is too high suggest
   acute MR.
   - Regional hypokinesis on [**Year (4 digits) **] suggested that the patient may have
   ischemic disease resulting in regional infarction of cardiac tissue.
   However, cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries, making
   ischemic etiology very unlikely.
        Although an infiltrative process is less likely because he does
   not have a restrictive pattern of cardiac disease, we are still
   investigating this possibility because the causes could be reversible.
   These include: ESR/[**Doctor First Name **] to investigate for sarcoidosis and SLE and giant
   cell arteritis, SPEP/UPEP for amyloidosis (although these could still
   be negative if amyloidosis is primarily cardiac), RF for rheumatoid
   cardiac disease, and iron studies for hemochromatosis.
        For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver evaluation.
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will facilitate.

   # ACID-BASE IMBALANCE.
        A contraction alkalosis occurs when there is loss of relatively
   large volumes of bicarbonate-free fluid, and IV loop diuretics which
   induce large fluid diuresis commonly cause contraction alkalosis (see
   [**Doctor Last Name 6257**] et [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Intern Med [**2080**], and [**Doctor First Name 1885**] et [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**2092**]).
   Because our patient diuresed over 3L yesterday and even more the days
   before, contraction metabolic alkalosis [**3-20**] lasix/diuril is the most
   likely explanation for his high HCO3. However, the patient
s ABG
   revealed a high PaCO2 of 60 this morning, which suggests there is a
   compensatory respiratory acidosis. In addition, there must be at least
   some component of a primary respiratory acidosis because his pH was
   7.35 this AM. Still, his vent settings will need to have a low rate and
   maintain that respiratory acidosis because it is mostly compensatory.
   Giving IVF at this time would be counter-productive given his clinical
   picture, but giving K+ would help correct his acid-base imbalance
   because he would waste less H+ in his urine.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (CHF consult) requested cardiac cath to eval for CAD due to
   concern for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Cath showed clean coronaries so
   heparin was restarted. Carotid massage during cath suggested sinus
   tachycardia more likely than atrial tachycardia, so cardioversion was
   deemed unnecessary. To increase CI, IABP was placed.
   - Apnic yesterday in setting of switching from Propofol to
   Fentanyl/versed, required switching to assist control ventilation
   - [**First Name (STitle) **] - Mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
   Restrictive left ventricular filling pattern suggestive of severe
   diastolic dysfunction. RV is dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. Normal aortic valve. 3 + MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] htn.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d, found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction,
   restrictive LV dysfunction, 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with hemodynamics consistent
   with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation, cardioversion, cardiac cath
   (clean coronaries), IABP placement.
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.
        The patient has been in cardiogenic shock as evidenced by
   requiring milrinone at 0.5 and IABP at 1:1 to maintain CI in the
   2.1-2.5 range and SvO2 in low 60s (goal CI>2.5, SvO2>70). MAPs have
   been stable in the 80s (goal >65) and [**Last Name (Titles) **] showed LVEF 20-25%. His
   CI/SvO2 are improving, but we will need to see more improvement if we
   are to wean his IABP. He has had great urine output (150-300cc per
   hour) on diuril bolus x1 and lasix gtt. CXR looks stable in terms of
   pulmonary congestion. We will plan to continue milrinone at 0.5 and
   IABP at 1:1 with goal CI>2.5. Goal I/O will be even because he likely
   has contraction alkalosis, so we will d/c lasix gtt if UOP remains
   high.
        While providing supportive care, we continue to investigate
   etiology. The potential etiologies of this patient's cardiomyopathy are
   vast, including: ischemic, valvular, tachycardia-induced, infectious
   ([**Location (un) **] [self-limited], HIV, and others), substance abuse (alcohol,
   cocaine), infiltrative (sarcoid, amyloidosis [SPEP, UPEP],
   hemochromatosis), connective tissue disease (high [**Doctor First Name **] titer),
   hypertensive, myocarditis (could check Fas and FasL), medication
   (doxorubicin). Unfortunately, nearly 50% of the time, work-up will turn
   out idiopathic (see [**Last Name (un) 6252**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2115**]).
        Cardiomyopathy workup to date makes valvular and ischemic
   etiologies unlikely causes of his cardiomyopathy:
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram showed 3+ mitral regurgitation, which
   raised the possibility that his cardiomyopathy is secondary to mitral
   valve disease. However, further examination revealed that the mitral
   valve annulus is increased in diameter, which suggests that mitral
   regurgitation developed secondary to the dilated ventricle.
   Furthermore, his PCWP on admission was 48, which is too high suggest
   acute MR.
   - Regional hypokinesis on [**Year (4 digits) **] suggested that the patient may have
   ischemic disease resulting in regional infarction of cardiac tissue.
   However, cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries, making
   ischemic etiology very unlikely.
        Although an infiltrative process is less likely because he does
   not have a restrictive pattern of cardiac disease, we are still
   investigating this possibility because the causes could be reversible.
   These include: ESR/[**Doctor First Name **] to investigate for sarcoidosis and SLE and giant
   cell arteritis, SPEP/UPEP for amyloidosis (although these could still
   be negative if amyloidosis is primarily cardiac), RF for rheumatoid
   cardiac disease, and iron studies for hemochromatosis.
        For transplant work-up, will need Hep B/C, CMV, HIV, carotid
   non-invasive study, abd US to r/o aortic dissection, liver evaluation.
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will facilitate.

   # ACID-BASE IMBALANCE.
        A contraction alkalosis occurs when there is loss of relatively
   large volumes of bicarbonate-free fluid, and IV loop diuretics which
   induce large fluid diuresis commonly cause contraction alkalosis (see
   [**Doctor Last Name 6257**] et [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Intern Med [**2080**], and [**Doctor First Name 1885**] et [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**2092**]).
   Because our patient diuresed over 3L yesterday and even more the days
   before, contraction metabolic alkalosis [**3-20**] lasix/diuril is the most
   likely explanation for his high HCO3. However, the patient
s ABG
   revealed a high PaCO2 of 60 this morning and a pH of 7.35, which
   suggests there is a compensatory respiratory acidosis. This indicates
   that his vent settings will need to have a low rate in order to
   maintain that respiratory acidosis. Giving IVF at this time would be
   counter-productive given his clinical picture, but giving K+ would help
   correct his acid-base imbalance because he would waste less H+ in his
   urine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have biventricular systolic dysfunction, restrictive left ventricular filling pattern suggestive of severe diastolic dysfunction, and moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and has been intubated, cardioverted, and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 20-25%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by the need for milrinone and IABP to maintain cardiac index (CI) in the 2.1-2.5 range and mixed venous saturation (SvO2) in the low 60s. Close monitoring and management of hemodynamics are essential to prevent further deterioration.

2. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient has a high bicarbonate level (HCO3) indicating metabolic alkalosis, likely due to diuresis with lasix/diuril. There is also a compensatory respiratory acidosis with a high PaCO2 of 60. Careful attention to ventilator settings and electrolyte management is required to maintain acid-base balance.

3. Renal Failure: The"

   # Cardiogenic shock:: CI drifting down to 1.9 from 2.4 yesterday likely
   due to reduced tachycardia and elevated MAPs.  Interestingly MAPs
   higher since dopamine stopped yesterday. Elevated PA and PCWP with low
   pulmonary vascular resistance further support cardiogenic shock.
   - Increase Milrinone  to 2.5 to reduce MAPs and impove ionotropy
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis given fluid overload. Will bolus with Diuril
   500 mg IVx1 this am after such good response yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) over the past five days and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient was subsequently intubated and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition is cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by reduced cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient had an EKG showing sinus tachycardia, but there was a suspicion of atrial flutter. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient may have underlying coronary artery disease, which could contribute to his current cardiogenic shock state. Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization is recommended.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will be challenging given his unstable hemodynamics and the need for cardiac catheterization.
5. Abdominal distention and ileus: The patient has signs of abdominal distention and bilious output through"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have a 3+ murmur on examination. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient was subsequently intubated and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac index improved to 3 from 2.4 overnight, but this is in the setting of fevers and tachycardia, which could represent infection. Ejection fraction is 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. Left and right ventricles show global hypokinesis. Coronary arteries are clean, making ischemic cardiomyopathy unlikely. Cardiomyopathy workup is underway. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is 21, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSh) is normal, rheumatoid factor (RF) is negative, and [Doctor First Name] is negative. Iron studies do not support hemochromatosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status is pending.

- Consider weaning milrinone and continue IABP at 1:1.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has been intubated and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support due to cardiogenic shock. His ejection fraction is 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. Coronary angiography showed clean coronaries, making ischemic cardiomyopathy unlikely. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a fever, which could indicate an infection. Other labs indicate elevated liver enzymes, kidney dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's acid-base status is in contraction alkalosis with superimposed respiratory acidosis. The plan is to wean from milrinone and continue IABP support, monitor Fick Q change of shift, and continue the cardiomyopathy workup. The patient's tachycardia appears to be sinus tachycardia, and amiodarone will be continued. Lasix and diuril will be used to improve volume status and renal artery geometry. An electrophysiology consult has been requested. The patient's respiratory failure is due to fluid overload, and he will be trialed on pressure support (PS) today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who is currently in the ICU for cardiogenic shock. He has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, heparin sodium, amiodarone, fentanyl, and lasix. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 73-86 mmHg, and an elevated temperature of 38.2°C. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen flow rate of 40%. Physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, presence of a gallop rhythm, and warm, well-perfused extremities with 1+ pitting edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition is cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The elevated temperature and low-grade fever suggest a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained for sputum, urine, and blood.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's potassium levels are elevated at 3.0 and 3.8, indicating potential renal impairment.
4. Liver dysfunction: Although the liver recs indicate unlikely cirrhosis, abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST) suggest possible liver injury or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, as indicated by low cardiac index (CI) and signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. The left and right ventricles show global hypokinesis, and the coronaries are clean, making ischemic cardiomyopathy unlikely. Cardiomyopathy workup is ongoing, and the patient has negative rheumatoid factor (RF) and ESR 21.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's CI improved to 3 from 2.4 last night, but this is in the setting of fevers and tachycardia, which could represent infection. Monitoring Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status is important.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which appeared to convert after dopamine was stopped yesterday. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to improve volume status with Lasix and diuril to help improve RA geometry.

3. Fever: The patient has a fever, and cultures will be done today. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

   due to reduced tachycardia and elevated MAPs.  Interestingly MAPs
   higher since dopamine stopped yesterday. Elevated PA and PCWP with low

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression who presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days. He was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intubation and cardioversion.

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition is cardiogenic shock, as indicated by reduced cardiac index (CI), elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, and low pulmonary vascular resistance. The plan includes increasing milrinone to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAPs) and improve inotropy, Lasix for diuresis due to fluid overload, monitoring Fick Q change, repeating TTE today, and complete cardiomyopathy workup.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient had atrial flutter, which appeared to convert to sinus tachycardia after dopamine was stopped. The plan is to continue amiodarone and improve volume status with Lasix and diuril to help improve right atrial (RA) geometry.
3. Coronaries: Biomarkers are flat, and ROMI is complete. The patient will need a cardiac catheterization prior to discharge to evaluate for ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient is on ASA 325.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock. He has been intubated and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition suggests cardiogenic shock, which is a state of reduced cardiac output leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. This can result in multiple organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Infection: The presence of fevers and tachycardia raises suspicion for infection, which could be due to sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, indicating tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type, but other arrhythmias should be considered and monitored.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Extubation may be considered once the patient's condition improves and respiratory function stabilizes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient was intubated for airway protection but self-extubated on rounds. He is currently receiving antibiotics for fevers and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. He has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and has had a Swan-Ganz catheter removed due to concerns of infection risk. The patient also has hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, and possible acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of cardiogenic shock. He is currently receiving D5W to replete free water deficit and will continue to trend daily INR, glucose, and liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's EF of 20% indicates severe left ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to cardiogenic shock. The current management includes IABP support and aggressive fluid resuscitation"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for 5 days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram (TTE). The patient was intubated for airway protection and subsequently self-extubated during rounds. He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for fevers and concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's subclavian line was pulled due to concern for infection, and a cordis line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. He also has a Swan-Ganz catheter that was removed due to infection risk. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 130-150 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation (AF), blood pressure ranging from 75-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on 4 liters of nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake-output discrepancy, with total intake being 3,396 mL and total output being 2,820 mL."

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was intubated for airway protection but is now extubated.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output is still appropriate as indicated by warm extremities and improving liver and renal function. However, the patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. Left and right ventricles show global hypokinesis, making ischemic cardiomyopathy unlikely. A workup for cardiomyopathy is underway.

2. Tachycardia: The patient developed atrial fibrillation (AF) yesterday and received a third amiodarone load along with digoxin. The initial concern for sepsis is reduced due to the patient being afebrile since starting antibiotics.

3. Fever: No positive culture data were found, so vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. The patient is afebrile since starting antibiotics, so consideration may be given to"

   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d and found to have 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] TTE with
   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p intubation and
   IABP placement
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock:: CI improved to 3 from 2.4 last night, but this is
   in the setting of fevers and tachycardia which could represent
   infection.  EF 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. LV and
   RV with global hypokinesis. Clean coronaries make ischemic
   cardiomyopathy unlikely. Cardiomyopathy workup underway. ESR 21. TSh
   normal. RF neg. [**Doctor First Name **] neg. Iron studies not consistent with
   hemochromatosis. HIV pending.
   - Will consider weaning milirone and continue IABP at 1;1
   - Monitor Fick Q change of shift and with change in clinical status
   - continue cardiomyopathy work up.
   .
   # Tachycardia: EKG c/w Sinus tach this am. Appeared to convert after
   dopamine stopped yesterday. Plan to continue amiodarone and try to
   improve volume status with lasix and diuril to help improve RA
   geometry. Some initial concern for sepsis given reduced SVR, fevers and
   tachycardia.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue heparin gtt
   .
   # Fever: Will culture today and repeat CXR. Concern for VAP/HAP so will
   start anbx coverage. Abd exam benign.
   - Start Vanco 1 g Q12 and Zosyn 4.5 q8
   - Will d/c swan line and culture tip
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely due to low volume. Free water deficit roughly 4
   liters. Will replete
 deficit with D5W.
   - Start 125 cc /hr D5w for 1.5 L
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete. Coronaries clean on
   Cath.
   - Will reduce ASA to 81 for primary prevention
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated [**7-9**] peri-cardioversion. Fluid status
   improved now.
   - Will trial with PS today
   .
   # Acid base status: Continues to have contraction alkalosis with
   superimposed respiratory acidosis. Will goal I/o even today and replete
   free water as above.
   .
   # Transaminitis: suspect shock liver. LFTs improving. INR elevated but
   stable.
   .  Trend daily INR, glucose, and ALT/AST.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has been intubated and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support due to cardiogenic shock. His ejection fraction (EF) is 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. Coronary angiography showed clean coronaries, making ischemic cardiomyopathy unlikely.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been treated with amiodarone and metoprolol. He also has a rash on his back and thighs, suspected to be contact dermatitis rather than a drug rash. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to low fluid volume, with a free water deficit of approximately 4 liters. He will be repleted with D5W.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco 1 g Q12 and Zosyn 4.5 q8) for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His renal function is impaired, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac disease and recent psychiatric medication changes. He has been experiencing fever, decreased systemic vascular resistance, agitation, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. His vital signs are stable but show signs of fluid overload. He is receiving multiple medications and has several lines and tubes in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and impaired skin integrity could indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of worsening infection is necessary.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and evidence of cardiac dysfunction may suggest cardiogenic shock. Continued monitoring of hemodynamic status and cardiac function is essential.
3. Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion could be indicative of delirium. Proper management of his psychiatric medications and addressing any contributing factors should be considered.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an excess of fluid intake compared to output, indicating possible fluid overload. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration are required.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent development of atrial fibrillation should be closely monitored, and appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be continued.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The rash on the patient's back/thighs may be due to contact dermatitis or a drug rash. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of cardiac issues. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2124-7-9**] and is currently on various medications including heparin sodium, milrinone, amiodarone, and metoprolol. The patient has a history of heart rhythm disturbances and requires an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient also has moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The patient's weight has decreased from 118.2 kg at admission to 113 kg currently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is severely depressed, and there is a concern for ongoing cardiogenic shock based on the low blood pressure readings.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has not been assessed for skin integrity, which could indicate potential pressure ulcers or other skin-related issues.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status is not assessed, which raises concerns about delirium or confusion.
4. Fever: The patient has a recorded temperature of 37.2 C, indicating a fever.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient is being managed for hypernatremia with fluid restrictions and free water administration.

   Assessment and Plan
   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d and found to have 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] TTE with
   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p IABP placement.
   Was intubated for airway protection and now extubated.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock:: Swan removed yesterday given concern of infection
   risk. CI prior to swan removal much improved to 3. Warm extremities and
   improving LFTs and Renal function indicate that cardiac output still
   appropriate. EF 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on TTE. LV and
   RV with global hypokinesis. Clean coronaries make ischemic
   cardiomyopathy unlikely. Cardiomyopathy workup underway. ESR 21. TSh
   normal. RF neg. [**Doctor First Name **] neg. Iron studies not consistent with
   hemochromatosis. HIV negative.
   - Decrease milrinone to 0.375 mg/kg/hr
   - Place cordis on LEFT side and repeat Swan to repeat CI on reduced
   dose milrinone
   - Continue IABP for now with 1:1
   - Conginue heparin gtt with IABP
   - Repeat TTE with and without pump to assess EF and MR
   .
   # Tachycardia: Afib yesterday and now s/p third amiodarone load and
   digoxin added as well. Some initial concern for sepsis given reduced
   SVR, fevers and tachycardia. Afebrile since antibiotics started. .
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue digoxin
   - Continue heparin gtt
   .
   # Fever: No positive culture data.. Concern for VAP/HAP so vanco, zosyn
   started. Swan removed for concern of infection risk and tip cultured.
   Afebrile since abx started.
   - Continue  Vanco 1 g Q12 and Zosyn 4.5 q8
   - F/u cx data
   - Will consider d/c abx tomorrow if remains afebrile
   .
   # Hypernatremia/Metabolic alkalosis: Likely due to low volume in
   setting of aggressive diureiss. Free water deficit roughly 4 liters
   again today. Will replete
 deficit with D5W.
   - Start 125 cc /hr D5w for 2 L
   - Will start diamox to correct alkalosis in hopes of improving
   respiratory drive
   .
   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete. Coronaries clean on
   Cath.
   - Will reduce ASA to 81 for primary prevention
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Given distribution in dependent areas, will assume this is

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation on echocardiography. The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock, and he has been placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). He was intubated for airway protection but has since been extubated.

The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with signs of diastolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Both the left and right ventricles show global hypokinesis. Coronary angiography revealed clean coronaries, making ischemic cardiomyopathy unlikely. Additional tests are being conducted to evaluate for other causes of cardiomyopathy.

The patient's current medications include milrinone, amiodarone, digoxin, heparin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. His allergies include carbamazepine (Tegretol).

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Renal function is also impaired, with an elevated creatinine (Cr) level. Other lab results indicate metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 74 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 87/67 mmHg to 121/99 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%, and temperature (T) ranging from 36.6°C to 37.2°C.

The patient has a fever, which is suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). Antibiotics have been started, and the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been cultured. The patient is afebrile since the antibiotics were initiated.

The patient's fluid balance shows an ongoing deficit, and he has been receiving free water (D5W) to replete the deficit. Metabolic alkalosis is also being treated with diamox.

The patient's care plan includes reducing the dosage of milrinone, placing the cordis on the left side, repeating the Swan-Ganz catheterization, continuing IABP support, and repeating TTE to assess ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation. Amiodarone and digoxin will be continued, as well as heparin.

The patient's other medical issues include hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, tachycardia, and transaminitis. The transaminit"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath over the past five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient also exhibited hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock and was subsequently intubated for airway protection. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a severe drop in cardiac output leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The IABP has been placed to support blood flow and improve myocardial oxygen supply.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had an initial concern for sepsis due to tachycardia, fevers, and reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR). However, the patient's temperature has remained stable since starting antibiotics, suggesting that the tachycardia is now well-controlled.

3. Fever: Despite the initiation of antibiotics, the patient's fever curve is trending up, indicating a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotics have been started, and lines have been removed for infection control. Cultures of the removed lines are pending.

   53yo male with history of obesity, OSA, and depression who p/w
   increasing SOB x5d and found to have 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] TTE with
   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p IABP placement.
   Was intubated for airway protection and now extubated.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Swan replaced yesterday with new cordis for
   invasive hemodynamics. CI 2.4 this am down from 3.4 yesterday evening
   in the setting of decrased milrinone dose. TTE reveals some improvement
   in EF and MR compared to earlier in the week which is quite
   encouraging. Cardiomyopathy w/u negative thus far cardiac cath, TSH,
   ESR, RF, [**Doctor First Name **], Iron studies and HIV.
   - Change pump to 1:4. Thereafter will gradually  wean pressors
   - Add captopril for increased afterload reduction and will attempt to
   d/c milrinone later today if CI remains greater than 2
   - Repeat Fick Q change of shift and change is nstatus
   - Continue IABP for now with 1:1
   - Continue heparin gtt with IABP
   - f/u CHF reccs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Well rate controlled since addition of digoxin 2 days
   ago.. Some initial concern for sepsis given reduced SVR, fevers and
   tachycardia. Afebrile since antibiotics started.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue digoxin
   .
   # Fever: Cx data remains unrevealing.. Concern for VAP/HAP so vanco,
   zosyn started. Swan removed for concern of infection risk and tip
   cultured with ngtd. Cordis also removed yesterday and cultured.
   Afebrile since abx started but fever curve trending up.
   - D/c a line today
   - Continue  Vanco 1 g Q12 and Zosyn 4.5 q8 and plan to narrow
   antibiotic coverage if remains afebrile next 24 hours
   - F/u cx data
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na corrected from 148 to 141 with FW repletion
   yesterday. Was likely due to overaggressive diuresis.
   - Repeat lytes and calculate FW deficit in the afternoon. Restart FW as
   necessary.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Origin likely contraction alkalosis in the
   setting of diuresis.  pH and Bicarb improved today after starting
   diamox yesterday.
   - D/c diamox for now
   - Repeat ABG to assess acid base in pm
   - Goal I/O even

   # Coronaries: Biomarkers flat. ROMI complete. Coronaries clean on
   Cath.
   - Continue asa
   # Rash: Distribution remains consistent with contact dermatitis.
   - Continue abx for now as above
   - Bleach free sheets

   hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. Now s/p IABP placement.
   Was intubated for airway protection and now extubated.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Swan replaced yesterday with new cordis for
   invasive hemodynamics. CI 2.4 this am down from 3.4 yesterday evening
   in the setting of decrased milrinone dose. TTE reveals some improvement
   in EF and MR compared to earlier in the week which is quite
   encouraging. Cardiomyopathy w/u negative thus far cardiac cath, TSH,
   ESR, RF, [**Doctor First Name **], Iron studies and HIV.
   - Add captopril for increased afterload reduction and will attempt to
   d/c milrinone later today if CI remains greater than 2
   - Repeat Fick Q change of shift and change is nstatus
   - Continue IABP for now with 1:1
   - Continue heparin gtt with IABP
   - f/u CHF reccs
   .
   # Tachycardia: Well rate controlled since addition of digoxin 2 days
   ago.. Some initial concern for sepsis given reduced SVR, fevers and
   tachycardia. Afebrile since antibiotics started.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue digoxin
   .
   # Fever: Cx data remains unrevealing.. Concern for VAP/HAP so vanco,
   zosyn started. Swan removed for concern of infection risk and tip
   cultured with ngtd. Cordis also removed yesterday and cultured.
   Afebrile since abx started but fever curve trending up.
   - D/c a line today
   - Continue  Vanco 1 g Q12 and Zosyn 4.5 q8 and plan to narrow
   antibiotic coverage if remains afebrile next 24 hours

   # Hypernatremia: Na corrected from 148 to 141 with FW repletion
   yesterday. Was likely due to overaggressive diuresis.
   - Repeat lytes and calculate FW deficit in the afternoon. Restart FW as
   necessary.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Origin likely contraction alkalosis in the
   setting of diuresis.  pH and Bicarb improved today after starting
   diamox yesterday.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient was intubated for airway protection and is now extubated.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock, as indicated by low blood pressure (BP), decreased cardiac index (CI), and the need for an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. The TTE shows some improvement in ejection fraction (EF) and MR compared to earlier in the week.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which remains unrevealing despite cultures. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), so vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. The fever curve is trending up despite antibiotic therapy.

3. Tachycardia: The patient had supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is now well-controlled since the addition of digoxin two days ago. Initial concern for sepsis was due to reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR), fevers, and tachycard"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). He was intubated for airway protection and now extubated.

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following medical conditions:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, indicated by hemodynamics consistent with the condition. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been placed, and the patient's cardiac index (CI) has improved from 3.4 yesterday evening to 2.4 this morning. TTE reveals some improvement in ejection fraction (EF) and MR compared to earlier in the week.

2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient's well-controlled heart rate suggests that SVT is currently managed effectively with medication. Digoxin has been added, and a plan is in place for beta-blocker therapy.

3. Fever: Despite antibiotics, the patient remains febrile. Cultures remain unrevealing, but the fever improved after removing the Swan-Ganz catheter, suggesting it may have been the source of infection. Vancomycin and piperacillin/taz"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for shock, cardiac origin, and subsequent development of fever, impaired skin integrity, supra ventricular tachycardia, delirium/confusion, and cardogenic shock. The patient has a history of allergies to Tegretol (Carbamazepine) and unknown allergies. The patient's medications include Captopril, Milrinone, Amiodarone, Heparin Sodium, Metoprolol, and ASA PR 300mg changed to 81mg PO.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a Tmax of 37.6°C and Tcurrent of 37.1°C. Fever can be a sign of infection or inflammatory response in the body.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is a mention of impaired skin integrity in the assessment and plan section. This could indicate the presence of pressure ulcers or other skin-related issues.
3. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient's heart rhythm is mentioned as a first-degree AV block. However, there is also a mention of SVT. SVT is a condition where the heart beats faster than normal, which can lead to complications such as palpitations, dizziness, and even cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion,"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for 5 days and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), indicating hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. He underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off milrinone.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals the presence of a gallop, balloon pump clearly heard, no murmurs or rubs, clear lungs, medium firmness in the abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema to the knees. An erythematous macular rash is also noted on his back, elbows, thighs sparing the central spine, improving.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 13.8 K/uL, platelet count of 159 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 145 mg/dL, and potassium levels within normal range. Other lab values indicate elevated white blood cell"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression who presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days. He was found to have a 3+ mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off milrinone.

The patient's cardiogenic shock was initially treated with an unsuccessful trial of IABP at 1:4, with cardiac index (CI) less than 2. However, the CI improved to 2.1 when the IABP was switched back to 1:1, and milrinone was not restarted. The patient's cardiomyopathy workup was negative, including cardiac catheterization, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), doctor's first name, and iron studies, as well as HIV testing.

The plan for the patient includes continuing IABP at 1:1, increasing captopril to 37.5 mg three times a day (TID) for further afterload reduction, and attempting to increase to 50 mg TID later today. If the patient tolerates the uptitration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the IABP will be reduced"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, OSA, and depression.
- He presented with increasing shortness of breath for 5 days and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram.
- The patient underwent an invasive arterial line placement (Swan-Ganz catheter) and was intubated for airway protection.
- He is now extubated.
- The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to cardiomyopathy.
- He has undergone several interventions including balloon pump placement, initiation of IABP (Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump), and administration of various medications such as digoxin, metoprolol, amiodarone, and captopril.
- The patient's condition has shown some improvement with an increased cardiac index (CI) and improved urine output.
- However, he continues to have tachycardia controlled with atrial flutter and remains at risk for complications such as C. difficile infection, hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, and acute renal failure (suspected ATN).
- The patient's coronary arteries are clean based on cardiac catheterization results.
- He is expected to continue with aggressive medical management and close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's underlying cardiomyopathy may lead to persistent cardiogenic shock, requiring ongoing support with IABP"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is now in cardiogenic shock and has undergone intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. He was intubated for airway protection but is now extubated.

Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock, which is indicated by a low cardiac index (CI) of 2.4 this morning, down from 3.4 yesterday evening despite decreased milrinone dose. TTE shows some improvement in ejection fraction (EF) and MR compared to earlier in the week, which is encouraging. Cardiomyopathy workup is negative thus far.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is well-controlled since the addition of digoxin two days ago. Initial concern for sepsis due to reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR), fevers, and tachycardia, but the patient has been afebrile since starting antibiotics.

3. Fever: Despite unrevealing cultures, the patient's fever improved once the Swan-Ganz catheter was pulled, suggesting that the line"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction. On day 4, the patient's condition improved with good urine output and mentation. However, his cardiac index (CI) dropped to mid-1s and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased to 900s. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) was in the 80s, so captopril was increased to 25mg PO TID. At 5pm, the patient's CI improved to 1.8 with SVR of 1000, and he remained hemodynamically stable. Atrial flutter was rate-controlled. Throughout the night, the patient's CI fluctuated between 2.1 and 2.9 with decreasing SVR. He continues to be on heparin sodium infusion, digoxin, metoprolol, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation of cardiogenic shock indicates a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status or skin integrity, which could indicate the risk of pressure ulcers or other skin complications due to prolonged immobility.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, OSA, and depression.
- He presented with increasing shortness of breath and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), indicating cardiogenic shock.
- The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off milrinone.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function.
- The patient has been started on captopril, digoxin, metoprolol, and amiodarone for rate control.
- He has developed Clostridium difficile infection, for which he has been prescribed Flagyl.
- The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved, and his coronary arteries are clean based on cardiac catheterization.
- He has a rash consistent with contact dermatitis, and his acute kidney injury is suspected to be due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
- The patient is tolerating oral intake and is replete with electrolytes as needed.
- He has multiple lines and drains in place, including a cordis line in the left internal jugular vein, an arterial line, and peripheral lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing management indicate ongoing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression who presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days. He was found to have a 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram (TTE) and hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off of milrinone. 

The patient's current medications include captopril, heparin, digoxin, metoprolol, amiodarone, and Flagyl. The plan is to continue increasing the dose of captopril to 50 mg TID, attempt to taper off IABP, and closely monitor the patient's fluid balance and change in clinical status. The patient will continue on a regimen of anticoagulation with heparin while on IABP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition of cardiogenic shock poses a significant risk. It is important to monitor his hemodynamics and ensure adequate organ perfusion.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient may be at risk for AKI due to factors such as cardiogenic shock, potential use of nephrotoxic medications, and the presence of a contrast agent during coronary angiography.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression who presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days. He was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off milrinone. His Fick numbers CO/CI/SVR improved from 5.3/2.2/1010 to 6.5/2.7/888 after receiving captopril. Cardiomyopathy workup was negative, including cardiac catheterization, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), and iron studies, as well as HIV testing. The plan is to continue weaning IABP and increase captopril dose to 50 mg three times a day. The patient remains rate-controlled on digoxin, metoprolol, and amiodarone for tachycardia. He remains afebrile but has a positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test and started on Flagyl. His metabolic alkalosis has resolved, and he has improved renal function with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Coronary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiogenic shock and has been placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). His cardiomyopathy workup has been negative, including cardiac catheterization, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), and HIV testing. The plan is to continue weaning off the IABP, increase captopril dosage, and recheck Ficks on 100mg TID. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition of cardiogenic shock poses a significant risk. The IABP placement helps to improve hemodynamics, but there is a possibility of worsening shock if the weaning process is not managed properly.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has an erythematous macular rash on his back, elbows, thighs, and improving skin integrity. This could be due to contact dermatitis, but monitoring should be continued to ensure it does not progress to more severe skin breakdown.
3. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has been rate-controlled"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath over the past five days and was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram. The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock. He underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off Milrinone.

The patient's condition has improved with the following interventions: increasing captopril to 100mg TID, switching back to a 1:2 ratio overnight, and increasing the dose of metoprolol to 50mg TID with additional IV Lopressor as needed. The plan is to continue weaning off IABP today and increase captopril to 100mg TID. The patient's target cardiac index (CI) is 1.5-2.0 with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) >55. If CI worsens, the patient may switch back to 1:1 or consider adding an inotrope due to severe congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient remains rate-controlled with digoxin, metoprolol, and amiodarone. Flagyl has been started for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The metabolic alkalosis has resolved, and the patient's coronary arteries are clean"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression who presented with increasing shortness of breath for five days. He was found to have moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram and is now in cardiogenic shock. The patient has undergone an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and is being weaned off of Milrinone. 

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by the low cardiac output (CO) and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The IABP trial showed improvement in CO/CI/SVR after increasing captopril.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has tested positive for C. diff and is receiving treatment with Flagyl for a 14-day course.
3. Tachycardia: The patient remains rate-controlled with medications such as digoxin, metoprolol, and amiodarone.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved, likely due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis. Diamox was used to improve pH and bicarbonate levels.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has an erythematous macular rash on his back, elbows, thighs, which is improving and consistent with contact dermatitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac disease, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient has been experiencing fever, diarrhea, and impaired skin integrity. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/67 to 115/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 118.2 kg at admission to 113 kg currently. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures of 37/20 mmHg, cardiac output of 5.1 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation ranging from 48-71%. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,263 mL, output of 1,755 mL, with a negative balance of -492 mL. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and various other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's impaired cardiac function, indicated by the presence of a first-degree AV block and low cardiac output, increases the risk of cardiogenic shock.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, along with the presence of C. difficile infection, raises concern for other possible infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.

   will increase to 1:4 this afternoon and recheck Ficks on 100mg TID
   captopril.  Will tolerate CI 1.5- 2.0 with MAPs>55.  If CI worsening,
   switch back to 1:1 or consider adding back inotrope given severe CHF.
   - Cont Captopril 100 mg TID
   - Wean IABP as tolerated
   - Continue heparin gtt with IABP
   - I/O goal even to negative 500 cc

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation on echocardiography. The patient was in cardiogenic shock, which was treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and discontinuation of milrinone.

The patient's condition has been stable, with improved cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and blood pressure. His captopril dosage was increased to 100 mg three times a day, and he tolerated a CI of 1.5-2.0 with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 55. If his CI worsens, he may be switched back to 1:1 or consider adding an inotrope due to severe congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient remains rate-controlled for tachycardia, continuing on digoxin, metoprolol, and amiodarone. His fever and diarrhea are being treated with Flagyl for a total of 14 days. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved, and his coronary arteries are clean based on the cardiac catheterization results.

The patient is tolerating a regular oral diet and has repleted his electrolytes as needed. He has multiple lines and catheters in place"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have a 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has undergone various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hemodynamics are consistent with cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The patient has been placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and other measures are being taken to improve cardiac output.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient is suspected to have ATN due to cardiogenic shock. AKI/ATN is a potential complication in critically ill patients, especially those with low cardiac output and hypotension.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient had metabolic alkalosis, which has since resolved. This condition occurs when there is an excess of bicarbonate in the blood, leading to an elevated pH.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's coronary arteries were found to be clean on cardiac catheterization, indicating no significant blockages. However, the patient still requires ongoing monitoring and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), with hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and was taken off milrinone.

Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient remains hemodynamically stable after IABP removal. Goals include maintaining negative fluid balance of 1-1.5 liters and continuing captopril 100 mg TID.

2. Rhythm Disturbance: The patient remains rate-controlled in sinus rhythm. He is currently on digoxin, metoprolol, and amiodarone. Metoprolol dose should be decreased to 50 mg TID, with additional 5 mg IV lopressor given PRN. Amiodarone dosage should be decreased to 200 mg daily, and warfarin should be started while continuing heparin until therapeutic on coumadin.

3. Clostridioides difficile (C. diff)/Leukocytosis: The patient continues to have leukocytosis likely related to C. diff. KUB has been given due to reduced stool output, and flagyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) for five days and was found to have moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). He was in cardiogenic shock but is now hemodynamically stable after being placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and Milrinone. The patient has been diuresed well and continues to receive afterload reduction therapy with carvedilol, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril. 

The patient's rhythm remains controlled in sinus rhythm. He is taking metoprolol, amiodarone, digoxin, warfarin, and heparin. 

He has leukocytosis likely related to Clostridium difficile infection (CDiff), but other blood and urine cultures are negative. The patient is being treated with Flagyl for 14 days. 

Lower extremities are warm and well perfused, but have been cooler in recent days. The patient's pulses remain dopplerable. 

There are no active coronary issues, so aspirin (ASA) will be continued. 

The patient has a rash consistent with contact dermatitis, so he will be given bleach-free sheets and continue to be monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression. He presented with increasing shortness of breath and was found to have severe mitral regurgitation and cardiogenic shock. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed, and the patient is currently hemodynamically stable. The patient is being diuresed well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient remains hemodynamically stable post-IABP placement but may still be at risk for complications associated with cardiogenic shock, such as hypotension, organ dysfunction, and arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis likely related to Clostridium difficile infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and completing the course of Flagyl is important.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has lower extremity edema and previous episodes of cold toes, indicating potential peripheral vascular disease. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and consideration for anticoagulation are necessary.
4. Contact Dermatitis: The patient has a rash consistent with contact dermatitis. Avoiding exposure to bleach and continuing to monitor the rash is advised.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history and presentation suggest possible underlying coronary artery disease. Regular monitoring of cardiac status and consideration for further cardiac evaluation, such as ABIs, may"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Upon admission, he was found to have an elevated blood glucose level of 123 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 41 g/dL. His vital signs were stable with a temperature of 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

The patient was started on warfarin and heparin for anticoagulation. However, due to cold toes episode, the ABI (ankle-brachial index) was put on hold until the patient is diuresed more. The patient also had an episode of self-removed central line in the middle of the night.

His fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,168 mL and total output of 2,675 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -1,507 mL. His urine output has been consistently around 510 mL/day. The patient's weight has decreased from 118.2 kg at admission to 115 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count ranging from 13.4 to 17.3 K/uL, hemoglobin levels ranging from 35."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently showing several medical complications. 

1. Cold toes: The patient experienced an episode of cold toes, which suggests poor peripheral circulation. This could be indicative of a vascular issue or possibly related to the cardiac condition.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of erythematous macular rash on the back, elbows, thighs, and shiny hairless skin on the calves indicates potential skin breakdown and compromised tissue perfusion.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low (94/43 mmHg), indicating possible cardiac dysfunction leading to reduced cardiac output and inadequate blood flow to vital organs.

4. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm but there have been episodes of SVT, which can be a sign of underlying cardiac issues or arrhythmias.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, especially in hospitalized patients.

6. Abnormal laboratory values: The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride), and elevated lactate levels, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction.

7. Fluid balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, as"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition remains stable, but there is a risk of worsening cardiogenic shock if his heart function does not improve.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis suggests a possible infection, particularly Clostridium difficile infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection and ensuring appropriate antibiotic treatment is crucial.
3. Thrombosis: The patient is on heparin and warfarin, indicating a risk of bleeding complications. Regular monitoring of coagulation"
