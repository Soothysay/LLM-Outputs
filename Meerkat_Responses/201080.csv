","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis, currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and hypoglycemia. The patient's TSH level is slightly elevated at 4.7, and mental status has been fluctuating throughout the day while blood sugar levels remain stable in the low to mid 100's.

The rheumatologist recommended discontinuing azathioprine due to concerns about the patient not clearing insulin properly, leading to hypoglycemia. However, they do not believe it is due to anti-insulin receptor syndrome. A head CT was performed and read as negative. The patient was given Lasix 80 IV and produced a moderate amount of urine. Tests and lab results have been ordered, including T&S.

The patient's allergies include Tapazole (Oral) (Methimazole), and they have experienced a rash as a reaction. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2126-10-31**]. The patient is currently on infusions of Furosemide (Lasix) and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis).

Other medications include prednisone, which the rheumatologist wants to continue. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypoglycemia. He was admitted for altered mental status and hypoglycemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has periorbital edema, trace peripheral edema, and jugular venous distention. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine, potassium, and low hemoglobin levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications including insulin, azathioprine, and prednisone. The assessment and plan include close monitoring of the patient's mental status, facial swelling, and hypoglycemia. The patient is also being closely monitored for hypothermia, hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome increases the risk of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.
2. Facial edema: The patient presents with periorbital edema and trace peripheral edema, which could be indicative of angioedema or SVC syndrome.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is currently altered, and there is a concern for potential worsening or development of airway compromise.
4. Hypothyroidism:"

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with plan as
   outlined above by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6606**].  Major goal now is to resolve
   planning for dialysis and long term care before he leaves the hospital.
   I believe his cognitive dysfunction is more significant than
   immediately apparent and may be limiting his ability to comply with his
   plan of care. In any case, he is at significant risk of death from his
   recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and we should make a major effort to
   see if we can get him into an acceptable arrangement re his care.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin
   receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression, chronic kidney
   disease who is admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
   .
   # altered mental status: essentially back to baseline and most likely
   due to hypoglycemia.
   .
   # hypoglycemia: likely due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome.
   h/o multiple hypoglycemic events attributed to syndrome. Has resolved
   and is now slightly hyperglycemic, will d/c D5W and continue to monitor
   fingersticks for now. If stable may be able to go to the floor for
   further management. His PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 276**] physician were emailed regarding
   his admission, as this has been a chronic issue for the patient with
   multiple admissions and ED visits.
   -          d/c fluids
   -          q2 FS checks
   -          hold outpt insulin regimen for now
   .
   # facial edema: Unclear etiology. This may be secondary to uremic
   picture and his whole body fluid overload on presentation. Much
   improved today, and likely responded well to lasix yesterday.
   - continue lasix prn and monitor for improvement
   - avoid unneccessary IVF
   .
   # hypothermia: Resolved.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: type 1, since age 16 on insulin. As above,
   frequent hypoglycemic episodes attributed to anti-insulin Ab.
   - continue prednisone for now per rheumatology
   - holding lantus
   - ISS
   .
   # hypertension: hypertensive currently and h/o more significant
   hypertension in past. On multiple medications c/b LVH and diastolic
   CHF.
   - cont clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL, doxazosin with
   holding parameters
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of
   decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia.  Improved with
   lasix for fluid overload.
   - cont diltiazem and toprol XL
   - strict HR and BP control
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Renal was consulted for follow-up. He has
   been followed as outpatient for several years.  Qtn: should we start
   epo during this admission? He has also been screened for
   transplant,unsure whether his noncompliance will play a role in this.
   -r/u renal recs
   - cont sevelamer
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # Anemia: attributed to chronic kidney disease. Most recent baseline
   low to mid 20s, highest low 30s. Currently within most recent baseline.
   No evidence of bleeding currently so unclear as to what could have
   caused the acute drop today. Given low 20s is his baseline will not
   transfuse at this time
   - QD Hct unless evidence of bleeding
   - guiaic all stools

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypoglycemia. He was admitted for altered mental status, which has since resolved. The patient has several medical conditions including anemia, chronic kidney disease, chronic diastolic heart failure with left ventricular hypertrophy, facial edema, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently being treated in the ICU and his vital signs are stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) - The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes and was recently hyperglycemic. Monitoring his blood glucose levels and symptoms of hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis is important.
2. Chronic kidney disease progression - As the patient has a known history of chronic kidney disease, ongoing monitoring of renal function and management of fluid balance is crucial.
3. Heart failure exacerbation - The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH. Close monitoring of his fluid status and symptoms of heart failure is necessary.
4. Hypothyroidism - The patient has a history of hypothyroidism. Regular monitoring of thyroid function and adjustment of levothyroxine dosage may be required.
5. Anemia management - The patient has anemia attributed to chronic kidney disease."

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, hypoglycemia, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: Resolved, likely due to hypoglycemia.
2. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: Restart insulin regimen recommended by [Last Name (un) 276].
3. Facial edema: Unclear etiology, possibly secondary to uremia and whole body fluid overload on presentation. Improved since admission.
4. Hypertension: Continue clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL, doxazosin as per home regimen. BP has been well controlled over the last 24 hours.
5. Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia. Restart his home dose of lasix to continue diuresis.
6. Chronic kidney disease: Renal following. He is well known to the service, has been screened for kidney transplant but med compliance is an issue.
7. Anemia: Attributed to chronic kidney disease but also iron deficient. Will not transfuse at this time.
8. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin
   receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression, chronic kidney
   disease who is admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
   .
   # altered mental status: essentially back to baseline and most likely
   due to hypoglycemia.
   .
   # hypoglycemia: likely due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome.
   h/o multiple hypoglycemic events attributed to syndrome. Has resolved
   and is now slightly hyperglycemic, will d/c D5W and continue to monitor
   fingersticks for now. If stable may be able to go to the floor for
   further management. His PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 276**] physician were emailed regarding
   his admission, as this has been a chronic issue for the patient with
   multiple admissions and ED visits.
   -          d/c fluids
   -          q2 FS checks
   -          hold outpt insulin regimen for now
   .
   # facial edema: Unclear etiology. This may be secondary to uremic
   picture and his whole body fluid overload on presentation. Much
   improved today, and likely responded well to lasix yesterday.
   - continue lasix prn and monitor for improvement
   - avoid unneccessary IVF
   .
   # hypothermia: Resolved.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: type 1, since age 16 on insulin. As above,
   frequent hypoglycemic episodes attributed to anti-insulin Ab.
   - continue prednisone for now per rheumatology
   - holding lantus

   holding parameters
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of
   decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia.  Improved with
   lasix for fluid overload.
   - cont diltiazem and toprol XL
   - strict HR and BP control
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Renal was consulted for follow-up. He has
   been followed as outpatient for several years.  Qtn: should we start
   epo during this admission? He has also been screened for
   transplant,unsure whether his noncompliance will play a role in this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. He was admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status and is now in the MICU with hyperglycemia. The patient has multiple medical complications including hyperglycemia, altered mental status (resolved), facial edema (improved), hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and potential nutritional deficiencies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been significantly elevated, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) if not managed properly.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient previously experienced altered mental status, which could be due to hypoglycemia or another underlying cause. It is important to monitor his mental status closely.
3. Facial Edema: The patient has facial edema, which may be secondary to chronic renal insufficiency or angioedema. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is relatively normal at present. However, it is essential to monitor his blood pressure regularly and adjust his medication as necessary.
5. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and other comorbidities. The patient presented to the MICU with hyperglycemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient has type 1 DM and insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, making tight glycemic control challenging. The patient's current blood glucose levels are in the 400s. The patient was started on an insulin drip but was titrated off overnight. The blood glucose this morning is 136. However, after breakfast, the glucose level is still in the 400s. Endocrinology has been notified, and it has been decided to continue conservative management with prn Humalog (12U for 400) until further recommendations from endocrinology.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status has resolved, likely due to hypoglycemia given the prior history of similar events. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status is important to ensure there is no need for intubation.

3. Facial edema: The patient's facial edema has improved since admission. It is believed to be secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. Lasix 80 mg has been started, and the current steroid regimen will be continued. Consideration will be given to bilateral upper extremity Doppler to look for"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin
   receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression, chronic kidney
   disease who is admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: back to baseline and most likely due to
   hypoglycemia. Resolved
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: likely due to insulin receptor
   autoantibody syndrome, type 1 DM. Overnight became hyperglycemic thus
   will need his insulin regimen restarted. Will consult [**Last Name (un) 276**] regarding
   starting him back on insulin. Given he is no longer hypoglycemic and
   fingersticks are q4 he will likely be called out to medical floor
   today. PCP is aware of his admission as is the renal service who has
   been involved in his care for quite some time.
   -          Restart insulin regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   -          Q4 FS checks
   .
   # Facial edema: Unclear etiology. This may be secondary to uremia and
   his whole body fluid overload on presentation. Has improved since
   admission. We restarted aspirin yesterday  since this is unlikely to be
   the cause of his facial edema. He denies any trouble swallowing,
   breathing.
   - continue lasix and monitor for improvement
   .
   # Hypertension: continue clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL,
   doxazosin as per home regiment. BP has been well controlled over the
   last 24hrs.
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of
   decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia. Will restart his
   home dose of lasix to continue diuresis.
   - cont diltiazem and toprol XL
   -lasix 80 po bid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic anemia, and type I diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with altered mental status, inability to protect his airway, and risk for aspiration. Upon admission, his blood glucose level was found to be significantly elevated, leading to the initiation of an insulin drip. He also has a documented allergy to Tapazole (Methimazole). 

On the 24-hour mark, the patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 19% to 17%, indicating significant blood loss. A transfusion consent is pending. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-182 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. He is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid, as well as low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Other lab values, including white blood cell count, platelet count, and electrolytes, are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile indicates prolonged prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and low INR. Liver function tests are normal, and kidney function is impaired. 

The patient is receiving insulin for glycemic control,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin
   receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression, chronic kidney
   disease who is admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: back to baseline and most likely due to
   hypoglycemia. Resolved
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: likely due to insulin receptor
   autoantibody syndrome, type 1 DM. Overnight became hyperglycemic thus
   will need his insulin regimen restarted. Will consult [**Last Name (un) 276**] regarding
   starting him back on insulin. Given he is no longer hypoglycemic and
   fingersticks are q4 he will likely be called out to medical floor
   today. PCP is aware of his admission as is the renal service who has
   been involved in his care for quite some time.
   -          Restart insulin regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   -          Q4 FS checks
   .
   # Facial edema: Unclear etiology. This may be secondary to uremia and
   his whole body fluid overload on presentation. Has improved since
   admission. We restarted aspirin yesterday  since this is unlikely to be
   the cause of his facial edema. He denies any trouble swallowing,
   breathing.
   - continue lasix and monitor for improvement
   .
   # Hypertension: continue clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL,
   doxazosin as per home regiment. BP has been well controlled over the
   last 24hrs.
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of
   decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia. Will restart his
   home dose of lasix to continue diuresis.
   - cont diltiazem and toprol XL
   -lasix 80 po bid
   - strict I/Os, daily weights

   # Chronic kidney disease: Renal following. He is well known to the
   service, has been screened for kidney transplant but med compliance is
   an issue.
   - r/u renal recs
   - cont sevelamer
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # Anemia: attributed to chronic kidney disease but on iron studies he
   is also iron deficient. Most recent baseline low to mid 20s, highest
   low 30s. Currently within most recent baseline Given low 20s is his
   baseline will not transfuse at this time.
   - QD Hct unless evidence of bleeding
   - guaiac stools if hct continues to drop
   -iron supplementation

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypoglycemia. He was admitted for altered mental status but has since returned to baseline and is no longer hypoglycemic. The patient requires restarting his insulin regimen as recommended by Dr. [Last Name (un) 276]. 

The patient also has facial edema, which may be secondary to uremia and whole body fluid overload on presentation. The facial edema has improved since admission. Aspirin was restarted yesterday since it is unlikely to be the cause of his facial edema. 

The patient has hypertension that is well controlled with his current medications. He also has chronic diastolic heart failure with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but there is no evidence of decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) or current evidence of ischemia. His home dose of lasix will be restarted to continue diuresis.

The patient has chronic kidney disease and is well known to the renal service. He has been screened for kidney transplant but has issues with medication compliance. The patient's anemia is attributed to chronic kidney disease, but he is also iron deficient. His current Hct level is within his baseline range, so transfusion will not be performed at this time.

The patient has hypothyroidism with slightly elevated TSH but normal fT4. He will continue on"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin
   receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression, chronic kidney
   disease who was initially admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental
   status now presents to MICU with hyperglycemia.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  Patient has type 1 DM and insulin receptor
   autoantibody syndrome which makes tight glycemic control hard.
   Followed by endocrinology and rheumatology. Unclear precipitant for
   hyperglycemia but most likely due to increased oral intake.  Has been
   on prednisone for a while but this could contribute as well.  No signs
   or symptoms of infection or ischemia.  UA not suspicous for infection
   but has >1000 glucose without ketones.  No anion gap in serum.
   - Insulin drip started at 1 U, nadired at 10 U/hr but titrated off
   overnight. BG this am 136. However after breakfast glucose again in
   400s. [**Last Name (un) 276**] notified and said not to change regimen until they had
   seen the pt. Will continue to cover conservatively with prn humalog
   (12U for 400) until further [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs.
   - appreciate endocrinology and Rheumatology recommendations
   - will continue prednisone 15 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now (? Whether pt taking
   prednisone at home as there is no hypoglycemia in house)
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - per rheum will not offer additional immunosuppression as long as pt
   refusing HD
   .
   # altered mental status: Now resolved.  Most likely due to hypoglycemia
   given prior history of similar events.
   - insulin receptor autoAb syndrome management
   - close monitoring of MS to ensure no need for intubation
   .
   # facial edema: Improved since admission.  According to ED physicians
   and respiratory therapists who know patient well, these are not new
   findings. Most likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.  ?
   angioedema although no new meds recently.
   - lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - cont current steroid regimen
   - could consider bilateral upperextremity doppler to look for evidence
   of SVC occlusion.  Will try to minimize contrast given renal
   dysfunction.
   .
   # hypertension: Relatively normal now.  h/o more significant
   hypertension in past. On multiple medications c/b LVH and diastolic
   CHF.
   - cont clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL, doxazosin with
   holding parameters
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of
   decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia.
   - cont diltiazem and toprol XL
   - strict HR and BP control
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   - home furosemide as above
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Cr close to most recent baseline. Patient has
   been recommended to initiate hemodialysis but has refused.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - follow daily weights and I/Os
   - cont sevelamer
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # Anemia: attributed to chronic kidney disease. Most recent baseline
   low to mid 20s, highest low 30s. Currently slightly decreased to 17
   compared to most recent baseline. No evidence of bleeding currently.
   - QD Hct unless evidence of bleeding
   - T+S
   - guiaic all stools
   -started EPO
   - pt refusing transfusions
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Na to 132.  Recent baseline is at 139-144.  Still

   assessment and plan.  We are aiming for loose control w/o ketosis as he
   is recurrently hypoglycemic at home. He is clear he would not want CPR

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and hypoglycemia. He was initially admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status but is now presenting to the MICU with hyperglycemia. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH, anemia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on multiple medications for his conditions, including insulin, prednisone, clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL, doxazosin, sevelamer, and levothyroxine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. CKD can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attack, stroke, or heart failure.
4. Chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's LVH and diastolic heart failure may worsen,"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to insulin
   receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression, chronic kidney
   disease who is admitted for hypoglycemia and altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: back to baseline and most likely due to
   hypoglycemia. Resolved
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: likely due to insulin receptor
   autoantibody syndrome, type 1 DM. Overnight became hyperglycemic thus
   will need his insulin regimen restarted. Will consult [**Last Name (un) 276**] regarding
   starting him back on insulin. Given he is no longer hypoglycemic and
   fingersticks are q4 he will likely be called out to medical floor
   today. PCP is aware of his admission as is the renal service who has
   been involved in his care for quite some time.
   -          Restart insulin regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   -          Q4 FS checks
   .
   # Facial edema: Unclear etiology. This may be secondary to uremia and
   his whole body fluid overload on presentation. Has improved since
   admission. We restarted aspirin yesterday  since this is unlikely to be
   the cause of his facial edema. He denies any trouble swallowing,
   breathing.
   - continue lasix and monitor for improvement
   .
   # Hypertension: continue clonidine, minoxidil, diltiazem, toprol XL,
   doxazosin as per home regiment. BP has been well controlled over the
   last 24hrs.
   .
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure with LVH: No evidence of
   decompensated CHF. No current evidence of ischemia. Will restart his
   home dose of lasix to continue diuresis.
   - cont diltiazem and toprol XL
   -lasix 80 po bid
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Renal following. He is well known to the
   service, has been screened for kidney transplant but med compliance is
   an issue.
   - r/u renal recs
   - cont sevelamer
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   # Anemia: attributed to chronic kidney disease but on iron studies he
   is also iron deficient. Most recent baseline low to mid 20s, highest
   low 30s. Currently within most recent baseline Given low 20s is his
   baseline will not transfuse at this time.
   - QD Hct unless evidence of bleeding
   - guaiac stools if hct continues to drop
   -iron supplementation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 598**] Disease per prior reports. Slightly
   elevated TSH but normal fT4.
   - cont levothyroxine

2. Facial Edema: The etiology of the facial edema is unclear, but it may be secondary to uremia and fluid overload. Continued monitoring and use of diuretics like lasix are recommended.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled over the last 24 hours. It is important to continue the current antihypertensive regimen.
4. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure with LVH: There is no evidence of decompensated CHF or ischemia. Restarting the home dose of lasix for diuresis is recommended, along with strict input/output monitoring and daily weights.
