   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, possibly caused by aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth use. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation with propofol. His troponin levels were elevated, indicating possible demand ischemia, but are now trending down. The patient also has a history of asthma/COPD and is being treated with steroids and nebulizers. Other medical issues are noted in the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's condition is consistent with ARDS, which is a life-threatening lung condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. It can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots. The patient is at risk for developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a PE if the clot travels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with dyspnea, progressing to hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, as well as elevated troponin levels. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU for respiratory failure, elevated troponin levels, asthma/COPD, and pain control.

No stigmata of endocarditis are present, and there is a possibility of myocarditis. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS - PaO2/FiO2 less than 200, bilateral airspace disease. Therefore, broad coverage with antibiotics (levo, bactrim, vanc) should be continued until culture data returns.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure likely due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. 

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth use. He is being managed according to the ARDSnet protocol, with follow-up BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) results and discontinuation of Bactrim since the PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) test was negative. He will continue on levofloxacin/vancomycin, and steroids will be continued as well. Propofol is being used for sedation.

The patient also has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible demand ischemia. Troponin levels are now trending down, and a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) was unremarkable. The patient has been started on ASA (aspirin) 325 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and metoprolol 12.5 mg.

In terms of his asthma/COPD, the patient will continue on steroids and nebulizer treatments as before. He will be kept sedated enough on ARDSnet ventilation to minimize autopeep with patient-triggered ventilation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, aspiration pneumonia, and inhalational injury from crystal meth. He is on mechanical ventilation and has an arterial line in place. His vital signs are stable, but he is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and diagnosis of ARDS indicate a risk of ongoing respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial to assess the effectiveness of the ventilator settings and to detect any deterioration.

2. Infection: The presence of aspiration pneumonia and negative respiratory viral screen suggests the possibility of other infections. Close monitoring of the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory parameters is necessary to identify any signs of infection.

3. Cardiac Complications: Elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac involvement, likely due to demand ischemia. Ongoing cardiac monitoring and assessment are essential to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and the need for further interventions such as antiplatelet or cholesterol-lowering medications.

4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD increases the risk of exacerbation. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms, lung function tests, and adherence to prescribed medications (such as bronchodil"

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, Vt (set) 400 mL, RR (set) 24, PEEP 15 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, RSBI deferred due to PEEP > 10, PIP 30 cmH2O, Plateau 24 cmH2O, and SpO2 97%. His ABG results show PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 188, which indicates severe hypoxemia.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, famotidine, and heparin. His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine level. Troponin T level is within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows decreasing bibasilar infiltrates with clearing of CP angles. Microbiology reports indicate no fungus or acid-fast bacilli detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), but there is rare yeast present.

The patient's medical history includes methamphetamine use, chronic pain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department for continued management. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is sedated with propofol. He has been diagnosed with ARDS and aspiration pneumonia, and is being treated with antibiotics and steroids. His troponin levels are elevated, suggesting demand ischemia, but are now trending down. He also has asthma/COPD and is being treated with steroids and nebulizers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially progress to multi-organ failure.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's condition may worsen if he develops progressive ARDS, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and reduced oxygenation.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the invasive nature of mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial injury, which could be a result of demand ischemia or other cardiac issues. Monitoring the patient's cardiac function and providing appropriate cardiac support is essential.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COP"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by demand ischemia. The patient was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department for continued management.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - ARDS due to aspiration PNA or inhalational injury from crystal meth.
   - Plan: Continue levofloxacin and vancomycin, continue steroids, continue propofol for sedation, advance ET tube 2 cm.
2. Elevated Troponin - indicating demand ischemia. Troponin levels are now trending down. TTE unremarkable.
   - Plan: Administer aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol.
3. Asthma/COPD - already receiving steroids and nebs. Keep sedated enough on ARDS net ventilation to minimize autopeep with pt triggered ventilation.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac Complications: The elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial injury, which may indicate demand ischemia. This increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU from the operating room for continued management. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and intubated. He has been diagnosed with ARDS and aspiration pneumonia versus inhalational injury from crystal meth. His condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, and he has been diagnosed with ARDS. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, which may require increased support or alternative interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Infection: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and rare yeast in the BAL sample. There is a risk of developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation and immunosuppression.

3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels, suggesting cardiac ischemia. Further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure, could occur if not managed appropriately.

4. Drug Withdrawal: The patient shows signs of agitation and diaphoresis, raising concerns for narcotic withdrawal. If left untreated, this can lead to severe complications, including seizures and cardiovascular instability.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to demand ischemia and was transferred to the ICU for continued management. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial today and will be given another chance later today or in the morning. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 179/86 to 187/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 8 mmHg. The fluid balance shows an intake of 3,059 mL, including 877 mL through total intravenous fluids, and an output of 3,325 mL, including 635 mL through the tertiary output. The urine output is 3,325 mL, and the NG output is -266 mL. The patient's blood products and drains are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube connected to a ventilator in the assist-control mode with volume control ventilation. The set tidal volume is 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 12 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplat) is 36 cmH2O, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 36. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 152 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%. The patient's oxygen consumption (VO2) is estimated to be 14.8 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and normal bowel sounds. The patient's extremities show mild edema in the right leg. The patient's neurologic examination shows sedation with no assessment of movement or tone.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 10.3 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 278 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 78 mg"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. The patient is currently sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 179/86 mmHg to 115/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 3,059 mL and output of 3,325 mL since midnight. 

The patient has been receiving several medications including fentanyl, propofol, heparin, famotidine, lorazepam, and vancomycin. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 152. Other laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 278 K/uL, blood glucose level of 78 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as low sodium, potassium, and chloride levels.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure likely secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), aspiration pneumonia, or inhalational injury from crystal meth. The treatment plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, weaning off steroids, and monitoring BAL results. There are also concerns for narcotic withdrawal, so fentanyl is being used for sedation and withdrawal management. 

Other issues mentioned in the note include elevated troponin levels suggestive of demand ischemia, but now trending down. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was unremarkable, and the patient is on aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol for cardiac management. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis measures are being addressed in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. He is sedated with propofol and receiving fentanyl for pain and sedation. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and shows no signs of acute distress. His cardiovascular examination is normal, and his peripheral pulses are not assessed. His respiratory/chest examination shows clear breath sounds. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. His extremities are noted as 1+ on the right and 1+ on the left. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 278 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 34 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 87 mg/dL, and potassium of 3.7 mEq/L. Imaging reveals an improving chest X-ray with persistent left lower lobe airspace/pleural disease. 

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial today and will be given another opportunity later today or in the morning. His BAL results will continue to be followed, and he will continue receiving levofloxacin and vancomycin. Propofol will be used for sedation, and haloperidol may be considered if benzodiazepines are discontinued. Nebulizers and steroids will be continued for COPD/asthma management. 

The patient also has a fever with no clear source, possibly due to withdrawal. Pan culture has been ordered, and Tylenol will be given as needed. There are concerns for narcotic withdrawal given the agitation and diaphoresis, along with a history of significant anxiety disorder with high benzodiazepine requirements. Fentanyl transdermal (50mcg) will be started for sedation/withdrawal management, and benzodiazepines will be given through a gastrointestinal tube. 

The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest demand ischemia, which is now trending down. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was unremarkable, and aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol will be continued. Other issues were noted in the resident"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU from OSH for continued management. The patient has failed a spontaneous breathing trial today and requires mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with ARDS, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth. He also has a history of asthma/COPD. The patient's fever could be due to withdrawal, and he is being monitored closely. There are concerns for narcotic withdrawal given his agitation and diaphoresis, as well as a history of significant anxiety disorder with high benzodiazepine requirements. The patient has elevated troponin levels, suggestive of demand ischemia, but these are now trending down. He is on propofol for sedation and fentanyl for pain management. The patient is critically ill and currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD. He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was thought to be caused by demand ischemia. The patient was transferred to the ICU for continued management.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth. There was also an aspiration event yesterday, and the patient has a history of asthma/COPD.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient will be placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with attempts to extubate this afternoon. The significance of b-glucan is unclear as there is no evidence of fungal infection or immunocompromised state. The patient will continue to receive levofloxacin and vancomycin for aspiration coverage, as well as propofol for sedation. The endotracheal tube will be pulled back 3 cm.

2. Fever: The cause of the fever is unclear, but it could be due to withdrawal. Follow-up cultures will be done, and Tylenol will be given as needed.

3. Polysubstance abuse: The patient is showing signs of narcotic withdrawal, including agitation and diaphoresis. He has a history of significant anxiety disorder with high benzodiazepine requirements. The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department for continued management. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, suspected ARDS secondary to aspiration pneumonia versus inhalational injury from crystal meth use. He had an aspiration event yesterday. The patient's fever is unclear in origin, but could be due to withdrawal. He also has concerns for narcotic withdrawal given his agitation and diaphoresis. The patient's past medical history includes significant anxiety disorder with high benzodiazepine requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition that requires immediate medical intervention. The underlying cause of this failure is suspected to be ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to aspiration pneumonia or inhalational injury from crystal meth use.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had an aspiration event yesterday, indicating a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This condition occurs when foreign material, such as food, liquid, or stomach contents, enters the lungs, leading to infection and inflammation.
3. Inhalational Injury: The patient's use of crystal meth may have caused an inhalational injury, which can damage the respiratory system and contribute to respiratory failure.
4. Fever: The patient's fever is of unclear origin, and"

- He presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia.
- He was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department for continued management.
- The patient has been intubated for nine days and has attempted self-extubation.
- He has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin), nebulizers with steroids, and other medications for his COPD/asthma.
- The patient is experiencing fever, which could be related to withdrawal or an infection.
- Cultures have been ordered, and Tylenol has been given as needed for fever.
- The patient also has concerns for narcotic withdrawal and a history of significant anxiety disorder.
- He has been prescribed fentanyl transdermal (50mcg) and Valium as needed.
- The patient needs his access line resited today.
- His tube feeding has been put on hold.
- There are concerns for a possible NSTEMI, but no further evidence of ischemia was found.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Bloodstream infection due to the use of central lines.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of asthma, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic pain, myocardial infarction (AMI), and chronic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the hospital on [**2-27**] with respiratory distress and intubated for hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**3-2**]. The patient also presented with bilateral interstitial infiltrate and elevated Troponin levels.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and his chest x-ray shows bilateral interstitial infiltrate. He was initially intubated due to hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and has had several aspiration events. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Levo/Vanc/Flagyl) and receiving albuterol nebs and PO prednisone to manage his respiratory condition. Daily CXR will be done to follow the progression of infiltrates.

2. Chronic pain/sedation/withdrawal: The patient has difficulty with sedation due to tolerance of opiates and benzodiazepines. A home dose of fentanyl patch is recommended to cover for withdrawal, and diazepam will be uptitrated as needed to treat withdrawal and maintain sedation. A social worker consultation is planned after extubation.

3. Hematemesis: The patient has a history of possible gastritis, and H."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly due to demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. The patient is currently extubated and doing well, but experiencing overbreathing which has resulted in respiratory alkalosis in the setting of metabolic alkalosis. The etiology of this overbreathing is not entirely clear, but it could be related to anxiety or discomfort, despite being on significant benzodiazepines and narcotics.

The patient is being continued on antibiotics (levo/vanc/flagyl), nebulizers with steroids (Pred 40) for COPD/asthma, and other supportive measures. The patient also has a fever, which does not have a clear source but could be withdrawal-related. Cultures are being followed up to determine the cause of the fever, and Tylenol is provided as needed for fever management.

There are concerns for narcotic withdrawal given the patient's agitation and diaphoresis, as well as a history of significant anxiety disorder with high benzodiazepine requirements. The patient has been started on fentanyl transdermal (50mcg) and Valium as needed.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will remain so for now. There are also concerns for a previous NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and COPD who presented with hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure possibly caused by demand ischemia. He was transferred to the ICU for continued management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 107/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is extubated and doing well, but requires continued management for respiratory failure, fever, polysubstance abuse (concerns for narcotic withdrawal), nutrition, and NSTEMI. The patient has a PICC line in place, is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and is being monitored for VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor once stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further hypoxemia and hypercapnia, requiring immediate intervention such as reintubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient's persistent fever could indicate an ongoing infection or withdrawal syndrome. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Polysubstance Abuse and Withdrawal: The patient's history of methamphetamine use and concerns for narcotic withdrawal increase the risk of complications"
