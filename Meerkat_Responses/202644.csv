   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including nebulizers, steroid therapy, albuterol, ipratroprium, BiPAP, and Lasix.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/60 to 152/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for increased work of breathing and agitation. The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated PT/PTT/INR levels.

The patient's sputum culture shows 9-13 PMNs and less than 10 epithelial cells per 100X field, with 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Dyspnea/Wheezing: likely due to COPD exacerbation, possibly with an underlying infectious etiology or viral illness. The patient is currently tolerating BiPAP with little reserve.
- Continue steroid therapy (solu-Medrol 60 mg IV q8h) and switch to prednisone tomorrow with an extended taper.
- Continue albuterol Q4H and ipratroprium Q6H with albuterol Q2H PRN.
- Continue NC, but use BiPAP if shows signs of fatigue.
- Follow up final chest X-ray.
- Sputum culture with GPCs, follow up final speciation, holding off broadening for now; DFA negative.
- Continue levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 5 days for now, continue IV for now, reassess ability to take PO meds.
- Allow home Lasix at IV equivalent, no evidence of HF and BNP normal.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: currently on warfarin, though supratherapeutic.
- Continue verapamil and digoxin.
- Hold warfarin for now, gave 1.5mg vit K; goal INR 12-23.
3. Hyperlipidemia: continue simvastatin.
4. s/p MI: no current CP or concerning ischemic ECG changes. No prior available for comparison.
- Continue simvastatin, verapamil, and imdur.
- Patient is not on ASA as outpatient, unclear why.
- Continue warfarin as above.
- Continue furosemide.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a previous myocardial infarction. He presents with dyspnea and wheezing, which is most likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an increased respiratory rate. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP and receiving various medications for his conditions, including steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's underlying COPD and current symptoms of dyspnea and wheezing, there is a risk of respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his current ECG shows AFib. There is a possibility of worsening arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or medication interactions.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is systemically anticoagulated, there is a risk of bleeding complications. However, given his immobilization in the ICU, there is also a risk of developing DVT.
4. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows the presence of Gram-positive cocci in pairs, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Additionally, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may lead to antibiotic-associated complications"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous myocardial infarction. He presents with dyspnea and wheezing, which is likely due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient has been treated with nebulizers, steroid therapy, albuterol, ipratropium, and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. He is on bipap support and his oxygen saturation is maintained at 98%. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2 of 101 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals wheezing on lung auscultation, distant heart sounds, and peripheral pulses that are diminished. There is also evidence of right and left lower extremity edema and venous stasis changes.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures are negative for respiratory viral antigens, but there is evidence of gram-positive cocci in pairs on sputum culture.

The patient's medications include furosemide, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, simvastatin, verapamil, imdur, and warfarin. The plan involves continuing steroid therapy,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient's condition has been unstable, with increased work of breathing and agitation. He was given 0.5mg IV morphine, which helped improve his condition. He was taken off bipap for most of the night but had increased agitation overnight, so he was put back on bipap after 10 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 107/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on bipap support and has been receiving furosemide, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate infusions.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. His blood glucose level is within normal range, but his calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are slightly low. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, indicating a potential coagulation issue.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased work of breathing and reliance on bipap support indicate that he may be at risk for respiratory failure if his condition worsens"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing increased work of breathing and agitation throughout the day, requiring the use of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for respiratory support. Morphine sulfate was administered IV to address agitation, with positive results. The patient is also receiving furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management and lorazepam (Ativan) for sedation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/60 to 152/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 530 mL and output of 600 mL, with a negative balance of -70 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with tidal volume (Vt) ranging from 221-1039 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 21%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 21 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio at 481.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure with a history of COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has shown significant improvement since the previous day. 

Key findings from the note include:
1. The patient is tolerating periods off of bipap and feeling much better.
2. The patient has a history of COPD and is on various medications, including lorazepam, morphine sulfate, furosemide, and diltiazem.
3. Review of systems reveals fatigue, dry mouth, and dyspnea.
4. Vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 102 bpm), normal blood pressure, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 98%.
5. The patient has atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm.
6. Physical examination shows well-nourished, thin appearance with diminished breath sounds and prolonged expiratory phase, indicating possible obstructive lung disease.
7. There is also evidence of lower extremity edema.
8. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.
9. Imaging and other diagnostic tests are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has since resolved. However, there is a risk of recurrence if the patient's underlying COP"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with COPD, Afib, HTN, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing
   # Dyspnea/Wheezing: most likely COPD exacerbation. No clear inciting
   event.  Possibly underlying infectious etiology though CXR clear
   without any gross focal infiltrate.  Other possibility includes viral
   illness for trigger.  This also could be PE, though symptoms largely
   improved with nebulizers and steroid therapy, which makes this less
   likely and patient's INR is supratherapeutic.   Currently tolerating
   BIPAP with little reserve
   -- will begin steroid taper today
   - cont albuterol Q4H and ipratroprium Q6H with albuterol Q2H PRN
   - cont NC, but use BiPAP if shows signs of fatigue
   - sputum cx with GPCs but sparse growth, no need for abx expansion at
   this time.
   - cont levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 5 days for now.  Cont IV for now
   give, and reassess ability to take PO meds
   - can home lasix at IV equivalent, no e/o HF and BNP normal.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently on warfarin, though supratherapeutic.
   - cont verapamil and digoxin- unable to tolerate PO meds well this
   morning; start dilt gtt for rate control and switch back to verapamil
   when tolerates
   - hold warfarin for now, trending down, goal INR [**12-23**]
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont simvastatin
   # s/p MI: no current CP or concerning ischemic ECG changes.  No prior
   available for comparision
   - cont simvastatin, verapamil, and imdur
   - patient is not on ASA as outpatient, unclear why
   - cont warfarin as above
   - cont furosemide

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 117/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on BiPAP with little reserve and has been tolerating it well. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL, platelet count of 261 K/uL, sodium level of 134 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 28 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 25 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 38.7%, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose level of 118 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of <0.01.

The patient's imaging shows hyperinflation of the lung consistent with a history of COPD, with no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

The patient's assessment and plan include managing dyspnea/wheezing, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction. The patient is currently tolerating BiPAP with little reserve and will continue with nebulizers, steroid therapy, and other medications as before. The patient's warfarin therapy will be held due to a supratherapeutic INR, and the goal INR will be reassessed. The patient's code status and disposition are pending further evaluation and decision."

The patient initially did well on room air in the morning but later required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to failure of spontaneous breathing efforts. The patient was given Lasix 40 IV for possible effusions seen on chest X-ray. Overnight, the patient became agitated and required multiple doses of Haldol and Zyprexa. The patient was placed back on NIPPV with increased FiO2 and later tried on a ventilator but could not tolerate it. The patient's urine output improved after the placement of a Foley catheter. EKG results were unchanged, and the patient's medication for atrial fibrillation was adjusted. Repeat gas on bipap showed improvement. 

The patient has allergies to ace inhibitors and unknown medications. The last dose of antibiotics was Levofloxacin on 11/24/2144 at 09:10 AM. The patient is currently receiving Diltiazem, Lorazepam, Furosemide, and Haloperidol infusions. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/63 mmHg to 160/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and a history of COPD exacerbation. The patient's speech and swallow exam failed, leading to the use of a bipap mask for respiratory support. The patient experienced agitation overnight and has been on various medications, including diltiazem, lorazepam, haloperidol, morphine sulfate, and furosemide. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), blood pressure ranging from 128/61 mmHg to 160/83 mmHg, heart rate between 87 and 124 bpm, respiratory rate of 14-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a weight loss of 2.1 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,130 mL and output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 220 mL.

Respiratory support includes the use of a bipap mask with CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 446 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, RR of 28, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 21%, and SpO2 of 95%. The ABG results indicate pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, PaO2 of 333, and Ve of 9.5 L/min.

Physical examination reveals wheezing breath sounds and diminished breath sounds with prolonged expiration. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding appropriately. 

Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 261 K/uL, sodium level of 134 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and a temperature of 38.7%. Blood cultures were taken on multiple occasions, with WBC counts ranging from 8.6 to 15.8, Hct levels between 36.7 and 40.7, and platelet count of 353,000/uL. Other lab values include creatinine levels of 0.9-1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T levels below 0.01, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory status has worsened, necessitating the restart of bipap support. COPD exacerbation or tracheobronchitis is presumed to be the cause. Atrial fibrillation is also present, and the patient's INR is supratherapeutic, making pulmonary embolism unlikely. Smoking is still reported by the patient. 

The patient will continue to receive MDIs/Nebs, supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation above 88%, and a trial off bipap again. COPD management includes the use of inhaled steroids, bronchodilators, and home oxygen. 

Coumadin will be held to allow the INR to trend down, and a diltiazem drip will be initiated, transitioning to oral medication when feasible. The remainder of the plan is outlined in the resident's note. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with COPD, Afib, HTN, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing
   #Delirum:  Patient anxiety from respiratory distress vs. hypercapnea
   vs. medication induced from ativan/morphine/steroids vs. other
   secondary process.  Seems to be a chronic CO2 retainer, and PCO2 not
   markedly elevated to explain.  No active evidence of infection.  No
   focal neuron deficits.
   -- avoid ativan/morphine
   -- zyprexa or haldol for agitation
   -- ? if patient is developing acute pulm edema from albuterol, will
   switch to xopenex
   --  check TSH, vb12, rpr
   -- resend UA
   .
   # Dyspnea/Wheezing: most likely COPD exacerbation. No clear inciting
   event.  Possibly underlying infectious etiology though CXR clear
   without any gross focal infiltrate.  Other possibility includes viral
   illness for trigger.  This also could be PE, though symptoms largely
   improved with nebulizers and steroid therapy, which makes this less
   likely and patient's INR is supratherapeutic.   Currently tolerating
   BIPAP with little reserve
   -- cont steroid taper today, but will leave at current dose for
   prolonged taper
   - cont xopenex Q4H and ipratroprium Q6H with xopenex Q2H PRN
   - cont NC, but use BiPAP if shows signs of fatigue
   - sputum cx with GPCs but sparse growth, no need for abx expansion at
   this time.
   - cont levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 5 days for now (day [**1-22**]).  Cont IV
   for now give, and reassess ability to take PO meds
   - cont home lasix at IV equivalent, no e/o HF and BNP normal.
   - olanzapine for agitation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently on warfarin, though supratherapeutic.
   - cont verapamil and digoxin- unable to tolerate PO meds well this
   morning; start dilt gtt for rate control and switch back to verapamil
   when tolerates
   - hold warfarin for now, trending down, goal INR [**12-23**]
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont simvastatin
   # s/p MI: no current CP or concerning ischemic ECG changes.  No prior
   available for comparision
   - cont simvastatin, verapamil, and imdur
   - patient is not on ASA as outpatient, unclear why
   - cont warfarin as above
   - cont furosemide

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and unknown allergies to ace inhibitors. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving Diltiazem infusion, Furosemide (Lasix), Morphine sulfate, and Haloperidol (Haldol). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/68 to 141/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is still tachypnic with tenuous respiratory status. Physical examination shows diminished peripheral pulses, wheezes, poor air movement, and muscle wasting. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels, as well as decreased platelet count and potassium levels. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. This can lead to a prolonged QT interval, which may cause arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and current respiratory status suggest a high risk of respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He presented with dyspnea and wheezing, which is most likely due to a COPD exacerbation. There is no clear inciting event, but there is a possibility of an underlying infectious etiology or viral illness. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and he is currently tolerating BiPAP with little reserve. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium: The patient's anxiety from respiratory distress, hypercapnea, medication-induced, or other secondary processes is causing delirium. Chronic CO2 retention may be contributing to this. No active evidence of infection or focal neurological deficits were found. The plan includes avoiding ativan/morphine, using zyprexa or haldol for agitation, checking TSH, VB12, RPR, and performing an NCHCT.
2. Dyspnea/Wheezing: This is most likely a COPD exacerbation without a clear inciting event. It could be due to an underlying infectious etiology or viral illness. The possibility of pulmonary embolism is less likely as the patient's symptoms improved with nebulizers and steroid therapy. The patient is currently tolerating BiPAP with little reserve.
   - Continue steroid taper today but leave at current dose for prolonged taper.
   - Continue xopenex Q4H and ipratropium"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, who presented with dyspnea and wheezing. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing delirium, likely due to a combination of factors such as respiratory distress, hypercapnea, medication-induced effects, or other secondary processes. The patient's anxiety is contributing to the delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's dyspnea and wheezing may be indicative of a COPD exacerbation. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and continue with steroid therapy, bronchodilators, and oxygen supplementation as necessary.
2. Infection: Although the chest X-ray does not show any gross focal infiltrates, there is a possibility of an underlying infectious etiology contributing to the patient's symptoms. Monitoring for any signs of infection and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: Despite the improvement in symptoms with nebulizers and steroid therapy, the possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be ruled out completely. The patient's supratherapeutic INR suggests a potential risk factor for PE. Further evaluation with imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram may be needed to rule out PE.
4. Delirium: The patient is currently experiencing delirium, which could be due to multiple factors including"

COPD
   -per report on inhaled steroid, bronchodilators, home O2 at baseline

   Doubt that is a significant chronic retainer
   -More wheezing, [**Month (only) 202**] air movement today
   -pt admits to still smoking 'occasionally' - discuss smoking cessation
Atrial fibrillation
   -rate much better controlled today - in 80s
   -hold coumadin to allow INR to trend down

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and COPD exacerbation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/67 mmHg to 141/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, haloperidol, xopenex, atrovent, steroids, diltiazem, furosemide, and Lasix.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes in the respiratory chest area, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count of 15.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, elevated potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L, and slightly elevated troponin T level of 0.01 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory status has improved since yesterday, and he is being treated with bronchodilators, steroids, and supplemental oxygen as needed. COPD exacerbation or tracheobronchitis is presumed to be the etiology. The patient's atrial fibrillation rate is better controlled, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presented with dyspnea and wheezing. The patient's condition has been fluctuating throughout the day, with periods of reduced responsiveness and agitation. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of bronchospasm, agitation, and frequent morphine doses for air hunger. The patient was placed on CPAP for 2-3 hours and a venti mask overnight. A family meeting was held to discuss the patient's code status, and it was decided to make him DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and respiratory distress indicate a potential exacerbation of COPD. This condition can lead to further respiratory compromise and may require increased interventions such as mechanical ventilation.

2. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating level of consciousness and episodes of agitation could be indicative of delirium. Delirium can complicate the clinical picture, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and deep vein thrombosis.

3. Hypercalcemia: The elevated levels of calcium (Ca++) could potentially lead to complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, bone demineralization, and neuromuscular irritability.

4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with COPD, Afib, HTN, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing
   #Delirum:  Patient anxiety from respiratory distress vs. hypercapnea
   vs. medication induced from ativan/morphine/steroids vs. other
   secondary process.  Seems to be a chronic CO2 retainer, and PCO2 not
   markedly elevated to explain.  No active evidence of infection.  No
   focal neural deficits.
   -- avoid ativan/morphine
   -- zyprexa or haldol for agitation
   -- ? if patient is developing acute pulm edema from albuterol, cont
   xopenex
   --  TSH, vb12 nl; rpr pending
   --  add-on albumin to r/o hypercalcemia
   # Dyspnea/Wheezing: most likely COPD exacerbation. No clear inciting
   event.  Possibly underlying infectious etiology though CXR clear
   without any gross focal infiltrate.  Other possibility includes viral
   illness for trigger.  This also could be PE, though symptoms largely
   improved with nebulizers and steroid therapy, which makes this less
   likely and patient's INR is supratherapeutic.
   - code status addressed yesterday, dni/dnr
   - cont steroid taper today (day 5); decrease to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont xopenex Q4H and ipratroprium Q6H with xopenex Q2H PRN
   - use BiPAP if shows signs of fatigue
   - sputum cx with GPCs but sparse growth, no need for abx expansion at
   this time.
   - cont levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 5 days for now (day [**2-22**])
   - cont home lasix at IV equivalent, no e/o HF and BNP normal
   - olanzapine for agitation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently on warfarin, though supratherapeutic.
   - cont verapamil and digoxin
   - hold warfarin for now, trending down, goal INR [**12-23**]
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont simvastatin
   # s/p MI: no current CP or concerning ischemic ECG changes.  No prior
   available for comparision
   - cont simvastatin, verapamil, and imdur
   - patient is not on ASA as outpatient, unclear why
   - cont warfarin as above
   - cont furosemide

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with dyspnea and wheezing, indicating a possible COPD exacerbation. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with episodes of bronchospasm, agitation, and frequent morphine doses for air hunger. At 8 pm, there was increasing respiratory distress despite treatments, leading to the reintroduction of CPAP for 2-3 hours and the use of a ventimask overnight.
- The patient's mental status has been reduced, with periods of reduced responsiveness and agitation.
- The patient has been weaned off dilt gtt and has a stable heart rate in the 90s.
- There are multiple old strokes seen on the neurological exam.
- The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, possibly due to hypercapnea, medication-induced effects from ativan/morphine/steroids, or other secondary processes.
- The patient's dyspnea and wheezing are most likely due to a COPD exacerbation, possibly with an underlying infectious etiology or viral illness. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is less likely given the improvement with nebulizers and steroid therapy.
- The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, indicating an increased risk of bleeding.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), presenting with dyspnea and wheezing. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory distress with wheezing. The patient's respiratory status was deemed too tenuous for a video swallow, so a Dobhoff tube was placed. The patient's family was educated about the meaning of his code status, which they wanted to include resuscitation but no intubation.

The patient received morphine 2 mg for air hunger and haloperidol 5 mg for agitation. He was briefly placed on bipap but did well without it for the remainder of the night. Diltiazem 10 IV was given to control heart rate in the 140s.

The patient's allergies include ace inhibitors, and his last dose of antibiotics was levofloxacin on [**2144-11-27**] at 10:00 AM. He is currently on several infusions and medications, including pantoprazole, furosemide, haloperidol, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 35.9°C to 35.7°C, heart rate between 99-137 bpm, blood pressure between 114/67 mmHg and 103/63 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-28 breaths per minute, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and wheezing, likely caused by a viral illness with COPD exacerbation and aspiration. The patient's code status was discussed with the family, who wanted resuscitation but no intubation. His current medications include pantoprazole, furosemide, haloperidol, morphine sulfate, diltiazem, and levofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a venti mask. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on warfarin, though with a supratherapeutic INR. He also has hyperlipidemia and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient's delirium is likely due to anxiety from respiratory distress, hypercapnea, medication-induced, or other secondary processes. His main concerns include respiratory distress/COPD exacerbation, delirium, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and history of myocardial infarction.

   80 yo male with COPD, Afib, HTN, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing
   # Respiratory distress/COPD:  Likely viral illness with COPD
   exacerbation and aspiration. PE unlikely given improvement with nebs
   and supratherapeutic INR.
   - code status addressed yesterday, dni/dnr
   - family meeting today to address goals of care
   - cont steroid taper today (day 5); decrease to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - xopenex Q6H and ipratroprium Q6H with xopenex Q2H PRN
   - use BiPAP if shows signs of fatigue
   - cont levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 5 days for now (day [**3-24**])
   - cont home lasix at IV equivalent, no e/o HF and BNP normal
   - olanzapine for agitation
   # Delirum:  Patient anxiety from respiratory distress vs. hypercapnea
   vs. medication induced from ativan/morphine/steroids vs. other
   secondary process.  Seems to be a chronic CO2 retainer, and PCO2 not
   markedly elevated to explain.  No active evidence of infection.  No
   focal neural deficits.
   -- avoid ativan/morphine
   -- zyprexa or haldol for agitation
   -- ? if patient is developing acute pulm edema from albuterol, cont
   xopenex
   --  TSH, vb12 nl; rpr pending
   --  add-on albumin to r/o hypercalcemia
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently on warfarin, though supratherapeutic.
   - cont verapamil and digoxin
   - hold warfarin for now, trending down, goal INR [**12-23**]
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont simvastatin
   # s/p MI: no current CP or concerning ischemic ECG changes.  No prior
   available for comparision
   - cont simvastatin, verapamil, and imdur
   - patient is not on ASA as outpatient, unclear why

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: 80M (COPD, afib, HTN) who presents today after having worsening
   dyspnea at home.  Patient states that earlier today, he became acutely
   dyspneic and had significant wheezing after eating lunch.  He denies
   any preceding aspiration event.  He tried a neb treatment in the
   afternoon, which usually works for him, but this time, he did not feel
   better.  He does report recent URI symptoms, with a whitish sputum
   production over the last few days.  He denies fevers, chills, chest
   pains, orthopnea, or abdominal pain.  He subsequently presented to the
   ED.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: 97.9, 147/77, 116, 34, 100% NRB.  He was given
   nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the ED for presumed COPD
   exacerbation.  His CXR did not show any infiltrate.  He had an ECG with
   a RBBB, but no prior available for comparison.  He was initially placed
   on BiPAP (18/8), but then given his improvement, he was changed back to
   nasal cannula.  Prior to the time of transfer, he was changed to 2L NC,
   but he had increased work of breathing, and was eventually switched
   back to BiPAP.  His vitals prior to transfer were 104, 106/71, 27,
   98%2L NC.  His ABG at that time was 7.41/50/81.
   .
   Currently, he has difficulty speaking more than a few words at a time.
   He is still on the BIPAP mask.  He denies any current chest pain.
   24 Hour Events: Continues on nasal cannula (BiPap for just a few
   minutes without help so taken off). Dobhoff placed successfully. In
   family discussion with attending and fellow, family agreed to DNI/DNR
   status. Morphine PRN for dyspnea + hadol 5mg x2 for agititation.
   Tachycardia / Afib RVR resolved with dilt IV x1. Improved with dobhoff
   (now can receive verapamil home med).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea and significant wheezing after eating lunch. He has been diagnosed with a presumed COPD exacerbation and received nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the ED. His vital signs show an increased heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as low oxygen saturation levels.

The patient was initially placed on BiPAP but was later switched back to a nasal cannula due to increased work of breathing. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, and PaO2 of 81 mmHg. Currently, he is still on BiPAP and has difficulty speaking more than a few words at a time.

The patient's medications include simvastatin, digoxin, MVI, lasix (held overnight), protonix, verapamil, xopenex, and solmedrol. His allergies include ace inhibitors, and he has received various treatments and interventions for his condition.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His sodium levels are slightly elevated at 148 mEq/L. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: 80M (COPD, afib, HTN) who presents today after having worsening
   dyspnea at home.  Patient states that earlier today, he became acutely
   dyspneic and had significant wheezing after eating lunch.  He denies
   any preceding aspiration event.  He tried a neb treatment in the
   afternoon, which usually works for him, but this time, he did not feel
   better.  He does report recent URI symptoms, with a whitish sputum
   production over the last few days.  He denies fevers, chills, chest
   pains, orthopnea, or abdominal pain.  He subsequently presented to the
   ED.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: 97.9, 147/77, 116, 34, 100% NRB.  He was given
   nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the ED for presumed COPD
   exacerbation.  His CXR did not show any infiltrate.  He had an ECG with
   a RBBB, but no prior available for comparison.  He was initially placed
   on BiPAP (18/8), but then given his improvement, he was changed back to
   nasal cannula.  Prior to the time of transfer, he was changed to 2L NC,
   but he had increased work of breathing, and was eventually switched
   back to BiPAP.  His vitals prior to transfer were 104, 106/71, 27,
   98%2L NC.  His ABG at that time was 7.41/50/81.
   .
   Currently, he has difficulty speaking more than a few words at a time.
   He is still on the BIPAP mask.  He denies any current chest pain.
   24 Hour Events: Continues on nasal cannula (BiPap for just a few
   minutes without help so taken off). Dobhoff placed successfully. In
   family discussion with attending and fellow, family agreed to DNI/DNR
   status. Morphine PRN for dyspnea + hadol 5mg x2 for agititation.
   Tachycardia / Afib RVR resolved with dilt IV x1. Improved with dobhoff

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He presented with worsening dyspnea and wheezing, which improved after receiving nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the emergency department. His initial vital signs included a temperature of 97.9°F, blood pressure of 147/77 mmHg, heart rate of 116 bpm, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on NRB. He was initially placed on BiPAP but then switched back to nasal cannula. Prior to transfer, he was using 2L NC and eventually switched back to BiPAP due to increased work of breathing. His ABG at that time showed pH 7.41, PaCO2 50 mmHg, and PaO2 81 mmHg.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Difficulty speaking more than a few words at a time.
- Still on BiPAP mask.
- Denies any current chest pain.
- Family agreed to DNI/DNR status.
- Morphine PRN for dyspnea and hadol 5mg x2 for agitation.
- Tachycardia/afib resolved with diltiazem IV x1.
- Improved with doffing (now can receive verapamil home med).

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: 80M (COPD, afib, HTN) who presents today after having worsening
   dyspnea at home.  Patient states that earlier today, he became acutely
   dyspneic and had significant wheezing after eating lunch.  He denies
   any preceding aspiration event.  He tried a neb treatment in the
   afternoon, which usually works for him, but this time, he did not feel
   better.  He does report recent URI symptoms, with a whitish sputum
   production over the last few days.  He denies fevers, chills, chest
   pains, orthopnea, or abdominal pain.  He subsequently presented to the
   ED.
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: 97.9, 147/77, 116, 34, 100% NRB.  He was given
   nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the ED for presumed COPD
   exacerbation.  His CXR did not show any infiltrate.  He had an ECG with
   a RBBB, but no prior available for comparison.  He was initially placed
   on BiPAP (18/8), but then given his improvement, he was changed back to
   nasal cannula.  Prior to the time of transfer, he was changed to 2L NC,
   but he had increased work of breathing, and was eventually switched
   back to BiPAP.  His vitals prior to transfer were 104, 106/71, 27,
   98%2L NC.  His ABG at that time was 7.41/50/81.
   .
   Currently, he has difficulty speaking more than a few words at a time.
   He is still on the BIPAP mask.  He denies any current chest pain.
   24 Hour Events: Continues on nasal cannula (BiPap for just a few
   minutes without help so taken off). Dobhoff placed successfully. In
   family discussion with attending and fellow, family agreed to DNI/DNR
   status. Morphine PRN for dyspnea + hadol 5mg x2 for agititation.
   Tachycardia / Afib RVR resolved with dilt IV x1. Improved with dobhoff
   (now can receive verapamil home med).

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. He presented with worsening dyspnea and wheezing after eating lunch, without any preceding aspiration event. He has been treated with nebs, magnesium, and levofloxacin in the ED for presumed COPD exacerbation. 

The patient's vital signs upon admission were as follows: temperature 97.9°F, blood pressure 147/77 mmHg, heart rate 116 bpm, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on NRB. He was initially placed on BiPAP (18/8) but then switched back to nasal cannula. Prior to transfer, he was changed to 2L NC due to increased work of breathing and eventually switched back to BiPAP. His ABG at that time showed pH 7.41, PaCO2 50 mmHg, and PaO2 81 mmHg.

The patient's current condition includes difficulty speaking more than a few words at a time, still on the BIPAP mask, and denies any current chest pain. The patient's allergies include ace inhibitors, and his last dose of antibiotics was levofloxacin on [**2144-11-27**] 10:00 AM.

The patient's medications include simvastatin, digoxin, MVI,"

   80 yo male with COPD, Afib, HTN, who presents with dyspnea and wheezing
   .
   # Dyspnea/Wheezing: most likely COPD exacerbation. No clear inciting
   event.  Possibly underlying infectious etiology though CXR clear
   without any gross focal infiltrate.  Other possibility includes viral
   illness for trigger.  This also could be PE, though symptoms largely
   improved with nebulizers and steroid therapy, which makes this less
   likely and patient's INR is supratherapeutic.   Currently tolerating
   BIPAP with little reserve
   - cont steroid- solulmedrol 60 mg IV q8H for now
   - cont albuterol Q4H and ipratroprium Q6H with albuterol Q2H PRN
   - cont BiPAP at 18/8; recheck ABG this AM
   - f/u final CXR read
   - sputum cx; consider DFA for flu if febrile, but currently afebrile
   - cont levofloxacin 750 mg daily x 5 days for now.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: currently on warfarin, though supratherapeutic.
   - cont verapamil and digoxin
   - hold warfarin for now; goal INR [**12-23**]
