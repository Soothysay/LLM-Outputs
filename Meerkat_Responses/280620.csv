","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old with poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of likely left-sided community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

During the overnight period, the patient became hypoglycemic while receiving a large dose of exogenous insulin. To manage this, the patient started on a continuous D51/2NS infusion, with 4 boluses of D50. The patient is currently receiving regular insulin at a rate of 1 unit per hour. Other medications include pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 mmHg to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 5,812 mL with a total input of 1,040 mL, including 800 mL of PO and 962 mL of IVF. The total output is 650 mL of urine and 1,050 mL of blood products.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old individual with poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dry cough. The patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to left-sided community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient received a large dose of exogenous insulin overnight, leading to hypoglycemia. To address this, the patient was started on a continuous D51/2NS infusion with 4 boluses of D50. The patient has been on regular insulin at a rate of 1 unit per hour. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 mmHg to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 232 K/uL, blood glucose level of 197 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 7.1 mg/dL, sodium level of 107 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride level of 25.0%, and creatinine level of 7.3 mg/dL. The patient also has a WBC count of 12.3, Hct of 25.0, platelet count of 232, and BUN of 32 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 7 days, which can be tapered to levofloxacin for an additional 5 days (renally dosed). Sputum cultures, urine strep Ag, and urine legionella Ag will be followed up.

The patient's assessment includes pneumonia, DKA, abdominal pain/nausea, renal failure, anemia, and ICU care. The patient is on full code status, with access through a femoral triple-lumen catheter. Prophylactic medications include heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's disposition is to be monitored on the ICU today."

   2. DKA
       - Likely  Precipitated by infection vs med compliance
       - AG has closed, sugars improved.
       - Continue to monitor q1hr finger-stick's given high levels of
   exogenous insulin in the setting of renal failure.
       - Patient not eating; will continue insulin gtt
       - Can check BMPs q8hr
       - Based on 24hr insulin needs will determine daily SQ insulin
   regimen
       - Will notify patient's outpatient endocrinologist
   3. Abd pain, nausea
       - Likely secondary to gastroparesis.  Will correct sugars and when
   they are stable will start promotility agents.
       - Patient with bowel movements, so obstruction less likely.
   3. Renal failure
       - Patient with acute-on-chronic CKD, though baseline is ~ stage
   [**5-8**].
       - [**Name6 (MD) 59**] acute RRT needs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old with poorly-controlled DM type 1, complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dry cough. The patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of likely left-sided community-acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient received a large dose of exogenous insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia overnight. The patient was started on a continuous dextrose 50% infusion, with four boluses of D50. The patient has been receiving regular insulin at a rate of 1 unit per hour and other ICU medications including pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,812 mL and output of 1,050 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,762 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old with poorly-controlled DM type 1, complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and a dry cough. They were found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to left-sided pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient received a large dose of exogenous insulin overnight and became hypoglycemic. A continuous dextrose 51/2NS infusion was started, with four boluses of D50. The patient is currently on regular insulin at a rate of 1 unit per hour. Other medications include pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 133/81 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

The patient's blood glucose level is 197 mg/dL, sodium 107 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18 mmol/L, BUN 56 mg/dL, creatinine 7.3 mg/dL, and glucose 197 mg/dL. The WBC count is 12.3 K/uL, Hct is 25.0%, and platelet count is 232 K/uL. Other lab results include differential white blood cell counts, lactic acid level, calcium, magnesium, phosphate levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia - The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for 7 days, which can be tapered to levofloxacin alone for 5 days (renally dosed). Follow-up sputum cultures, urine strep antigen, urine legionella antigen, and viral panel are needed.
2. DKA - The patient's sugars have improved, and the AG has closed. Continue to monitor finger-stick blood glucose levels every hour due to high levels of exogenous insulin in the setting of renal failure. The patient is not eating, so insulin will be continued through a gtt. Check BMPs every 8 hours. Determine daily subcutaneous insulin regimen based on 24-hour insulin needs and notify outpatient endocrinologist.
3. Abdominal pain and nausea - Likely secondary to gastroparesis. Correct sugars and when stable, start motility agents.
4. Renal failure - The patient has acute-on-chronic chronic kidney disease (CKD), possibly stage 5-8. Acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) needs to"

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo with DM1 admit with DKA and acute-on-chronic renal failure in
   setting of ?  L. sided pneumonia / pneumonitis.
   1. Pneumonia
       - CXR unimpressive; ? spine sign may be more of a pneumonitis.
       - Is being treated with Ceftriaxone / Levofloxacin for 7 days
 can
   taper to FQ only x 5 days (renally dosed)
       - F/u sputum cutlures, urine strep Ag and urine legionella Ag,
   viral panel.
   2. DKA
       - Likely  Precipitated by infection vs med compliance
       - AG has closed, sugars improved.
       - Continue to monitor q1hr finger-stick's given high levels of
   exogenous insulin in the setting of renal failure.
       - Patient not eating; will continue insulin gtt
       - Can check BMPs q8hr
       - Based on 24hr insulin needs will determine daily SQ insulin
   regimen
       - Will notify patient's outpatient endocrinologist
   3. Abd pain, nausea
       - Likely secondary to gastroparesis.  Will correct sugars and when
   they are stable will start promotility agents.
       - Patient with bowel movements, so obstruction less likely.
   3. Renal failure
       - Patient with acute-on-chronic CKD, though baseline is ~ stage
   [**5-8**].
       - [**Name6 (MD) 59**] acute RRT needs
       - [**Name2 (NI) **] likely soon need initiation of RRT given progression of
   chronic disease. Renal team following
       - Needs Vit D repletion, Nephrocaps
   4) Anemia
        - Will guiac stools
        - Likely secondary to CKD and decreased erythropoiesis

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old with poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes, complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dry cough. The patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute-on-chronic renal failure, possibly due to left-sided pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient received a large dose of exogenous insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia overnight. To correct this, the patient was started on a continuous D51/2NS infusion with 4 boluses of D50. The patient has been receiving regular insulin infusion at a rate of 1 unit/hour. Other medications include pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 mmHg to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device information are also provided.

Physical examination findings include somnolence, uncooperative behavior, bilateral lung crackles, regular heart rhythm without murmurs or gallops, soft abdomen with no tenderness or bowel sounds, and warm and dry lower extremities"

","The patient's chief complaint is abdominal pain, cough, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). They have been refusing a foley catheter and experienced hypoglycemia following aggressive insulin drip titration. The patient has allergies to codeine, which caused hives in the past. 

In terms of medications, the patient is currently receiving insulin, pantoprazole (Protonix), lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). They were also previously on ceftriaxone.

Review of systems shows that the patient is still coughing but denies any nausea or shortness of breath. The vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 mmHg to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,812 mL and total output of 1,050 mL, resulting in a balance of 5,162 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable readings throughout.

The respiratory support indicates the use of a nasal cannula with 100% oxygen saturation and an ABG result of 7.26/38/121/19/-9. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (232 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin level (8.3 g/dL), high glucose level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), who has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is not yet on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient refused a foley catheter. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/81 mmHg to 158/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving an insulin drip, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. He has received ceftriaxone, dextrose 50%, and other medications as needed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. DKA: The patient's glucose is out of control due to insulin noncompliance, possibly with an underlying pneumonia or upper respiratory infection (URI). Hypoglycemia occurred due to aggressive insulin drip last night with delayed insulin clearance in the setting of ESRD. The plan is to continue the insulin drip until the gap closes, perform q1h fingersticks, continue volume resuscitation with half-normal saline (1/2NS) and 20Kcl at 125 mL/hr, watch for volume status carefully given ESRD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension, as well as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was found to have hypoglycemia following aggressive insulin therapy and is currently on an insulin drip. The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and there are no signs of acute distress or abnormalities on physical examination. His vital signs are stable, and respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose level is currently controlled, but he requires continued monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient's initial presentation was DKA, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. It is important to continue the insulin drip until the blood glucose level returns to normal and to monitor for any signs of recurrent hypoglycemia.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving an aggressive insulin drip. This can occur due to delayed insulin clearance in the presence of ESRD. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and cautious insulin administration are necessary to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.
3. Volume Status: Due to the patient's ESRD, there is a risk of volume overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and careful adjustment of fluid resuscitation are essential to maintain appropriate volume status.
4. Renal Failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), who presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has elevated blood glucose levels due to insulin noncompliance and an underlying possible pneumonia or upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is not yet on dialysis. He was given aggressive insulin therapy overnight, which caused hypoglycemia due to delayed insulin clearance in the setting of ESRD. The patient's fluid balance has been restored, and he is able to eat. He tested positive for influenza A and is being treated for possible pneumonia. The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and his renal function has improved with hydration. He is being monitored for acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypertension, and lower back pain. The patient will be transferred to the floor for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia due to aggressive insulin therapy and delayed clearance in the setting of ESRD. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent further episodes.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, including cough, chills, and a possible ""spine sign"" on chest film. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and sputum and flu swab cultures will be checked.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) who presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. DKA: The patient presented with DKA, which is a medical emergency characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. This condition can lead to severe complications if not promptly treated.

2. Influenza A: The patient tested positive for influenza A, indicating a viral infection that may have contributed to the development of DKA due to reduced insulin compliance.

3. Pneumonia: There is a suspicion of pneumonia due to the presence of a ""spine sign"" on chest film. However, the patient does not have significant cough or sputum production, leading to a low suspicion for pneumonia at this point.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient experienced abdominal pain, which resolved and is likely related to DKA. The abdominal exam was benign, and liver function tests/lipase were unremarkable.

5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate an acute deterioration in renal function. This could be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration or recent poor oral intake. The patient does not appear to be volume overloaded, and potassium levels are now controlled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) admitted to the ICU. He presented with symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and dry cough. The patient was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and tested positive for influenza A, possibly H1N1. He was started on intravenous insulin and later switched to subcutaneous insulin. His blood sugar levels have been stable without any hypoglycemic events for the past 24 hours. His baseline creatinine level is mentioned, and his electrolytes are stable. It is planned to follow up with the transplant service as an outpatient and start bicarbonate repletion to maintain a HCO3 level of 18. The patient is well beyond the 48-hour mark and has limited pulmonary and systemic symptoms, so antiviral therapy will be deferred. Levofloxacin was stopped since there is no evidence of pneumonia. The patient will be started on Reglan to manage gastroparesis. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned to the floor after discharge from the ICU."

","The patient is a 24-year-old with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM1) and stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with complaints of dry cough, myalgias, and fatigue. They were found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and tested positive for influenza A. The patient has been tolerating oral intake and switched from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin. Their blood sugars have been stable without any hypoglycemic events in the past 24 hours.

The patient's CKD is stable with baseline creatinine levels and stable electrolytes. They will be followed up with the transplant service as an outpatient and will start bicarbonate repletion to maintain a target HCO3- level of 18.

Influenza A treatment is not indicated at this time, and there is no evidence of pneumonia, so Levofloxacin will be discontinued.

The patient has been diagnosed with gastroparesis and will start Reglan 5mg 30 minutes before meals.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been initiated. The patient's code status is full code, and they will be transferred to the floor for further care.

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo with poorly controlled diabetes and stage 5 CKD with influenza A
   + DM / DKA
      - Precipitated in setting of influenza
      - AG closed
      - Tolerating oral intake; now switched to SQ insulin.
      - Sugars have been stable, without hypoglycemic events for past 24
   hours
   + CKD
       - Creatinine at baseline
       - Electrolytes stable
       - Will f/u with transplant service as outpatient
       - will start bicarbonate repletion to keep HCO3~18
   + Influenza A
       - Although patient in high risk group for influenza (with potential
   for H1N1), patient is well beyong 48 hour mark, and more
          improtantly, has limited pulmonary and systemic symptoms.
   Patient DM well controlled now, and Cr backat baseline.
          Therefore, will defer starting anti-viral therapy.
       - No evidence pneumonia --> d/c Levofloxacin
   + Gastroparesis
       - Will start Reglan 5mg 30 min before meals
   + ICU
       - Access= d/c femoral TLC, has peripherals
       - FULL Code
       - Prophy- no need for DVt or GI
       - Dispo- call out to floor

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old with poorly controlled diabetes and stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was admitted with complaints of dry cough, myalgias, and fatigue. The patient tested positive for influenza A and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Insulin was changed from intravenous to subcutaneous, and the patient tolerated oral intake. Blood sugars have been stable without hypoglycemic events for the past 24 hours. The patient's creatinine levels are at baseline, electrolytes are stable, and they will be followed up with a transplant service as an outpatient. Bicarbonate repletion will be started to maintain a target HCO3- level of 18. Influenza A treatment has been deferred due to the patient being well beyond the 48-hour mark and having limited pulmonary and systemic symptoms. Levofloxacin was discontinued as there was no evidence of pneumonia. The patient will start taking Reglan 5mg before meals to manage gastroparesis. ICU care includes glycemic control, nutrition support, line management, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they will be dispositioned to the floor."
