   Microbiology: no further culture data
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 80 y.o. man with pmh significant for systolic and
   diastolic CHF, ESRD, p/w dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension.
   #)Acute on Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure:
   Continues to have interstitial edema.
   -                Continue CVVH in coordination with renal with focus on
   pulling volume off, aim now -150cc/hour
   -                Support BP with levophed if becomes hypotensive on
   CVVH
   -                Possible component of HAP until cultures negative
   -                Cover with vanc/zosyn/levo
   #) Coronary Artery Disease
   -                Restarted asa, guaiac stools
   -                Defer restarting clopidogrel for now as patient has no
   recent stent
   -                Enzymes show trop leak, flat CKs suggesting no new
   event
    #)Hypotension: Does not appear to be new cardiac changes on recent
   echo, and does not appear to be infected and does not meet SIRS
   criteria. Only significant change has been his PASP trending upward
   over the last 10 months.
   -                continue digoxin
   -                f/u blood cultures
   -                levophed support as needed
   #) Pulmonary Hypertension: Likely worsening CHF, with RV dilation
   initially seen in [**Month (only) **]. Could consider clot given that he is no
   longer on systemic anticoagulation. He is not on AC (primary indication
   Afib) because this was deemed high risk because of UGIB. Will discuss
   with team and review old echo data further. Can consider RHC vs
   repeating echo when more diuresed.
   -                Check LENIS
   #) EColi UTI (Complicated): Positive at [**Hospital1 723**] from [**10-20**], sensitive to
   amp/clav though initially reported as ESBL.
   -                Change to Zosyn as part of coverage for HAP
   (sensitivity shown to e.coli)
   -                Will d/w ID if [**Last Name (un) 430**] is better alternative for recent
   urine infection
   #)h/o GI bleeding: Angioectasias seen in [**5-14**], recent GIB in [**9-14**]. Not
   currently bleeding, hematocrit is stable. holding anticoagulation.
   -                Guaiac stools
   #)Afib: Holding metorpolol , continue amiodarone and digoxin. Holding
   AC for recent GIB as above.
   #) ESRD: Continue CVVH and try to transition back to HD in near future.
   Given his BP limitations, we will have to have ongoing discussions with
   patient and family regarding ability to maximize his hemodynamics and
   ultrafiltration.
   #) Thrombocytopenia Labile platelets, HIT negative x2 in [**8-14**], though
   we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t have a great explanation for thrombocytopenia. Given negative
   studies for PF4, negative serotonin release assay, and review of recent
   heme consultation in [**9-14**] for same issue, will continue using heparin
   flushes/HD for now and reassess or seek further clarification if plts
   drop or develops thrombotic complications. Reconsult heme if need for
   heparin; hold heparin products
   #) Dislocated Shoulder: Per initial patient interview this is old,
   though now patient c/o more of his right arm and loss of its function.
   -                Ortho called; splint and OT/PT for arm/elbow
   #) Right upper Extremity Edema
 No recent IVs in that site raises
   possibility of deep venous thrombosis of the RUE.
   -                Check UENIs
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboot
   #) FEN: low salt diet diet as tolerated
   #) Access: Left IJ, left midline, right tunneled HD catheter..
   #) Code Status: DNR/DNI
   #) Dispo: likely pain and palliative care consult for symptom control,
   goals of care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and coronary artery disease. He presents with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress and is being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms of interstitial edema indicate worsening CHF. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Coronary artery disease: With a history of CAD, the patient is at risk for myocardial ischemia or infarction. Regular monitoring of cardiac enzymes and ECG changes is important to detect any new events.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires careful management, especially during CVVH. Supportive measures such as levophed infusion may be required to maintain adequate perfusion.

4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's elevated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) suggests worsening pulmonary hypertension. Further evaluation with right heart catheterization or repeat echocardiogram may be needed.

5. E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a complicated UTI caused by E. coli, which was initially reported as extended-spectrum"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of vascular disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic thrombocytopenia. He was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and hypotension. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic and Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient continues to pull off fluid with levophed support, indicating ongoing fluid overload. The plan includes continuing dobutamine as long as no ischemia is suspected, and maintaining on digoxin.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, which may be due to a new pneumonia. Coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been started with vancomycin, [Last Name (un) 430], and ciprofloxacin. Sputum cultures are pending.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD, Ischemic Heart Disease): The patient experienced chest pain, but there were no signs of ischemia on the ECG, although multiple blocks were seen. Biomarkers do not suggest a new cardiac event.

4. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN): The patient has risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE), but this has not been confirmed. The negative LENIs suggest against deep vein thrombosis ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is chest pain. The patient has been experiencing fluid pulling off at a rate of 100-150cc/hour while on levophed for blood pressure support. An ultrasound revealed a right internal jugular vein (IJV) clot, and heparin was started. There are no findings of left IJV clot on the lenis. The patient has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia, and heparin has been held.

The patient is also on various antibiotics for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organism. He has a history of chronic renal failure, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being continued.

The patient has several medical complications, including heart failure (systolic and diastolic), leukocytosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), pulmonary hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, wheezing, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/76 mmHg to 126/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of"

The patient is a 98-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and vasopressor support with levophed. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she is still experiencing hypotension. Her labs show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as signs of renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease suggest an increased risk of developing AKI. This can be further exacerbated by the use of nephrotoxic medications or ongoing hypotension.
2. Cardiogenic shock - The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressor support indicate a potential risk for cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is necessary to detect any deterioration.
3. Respiratory infection - The patient's history of pneumonia and current mechanical ventilation place her at risk for developing a respiratory infection. Regular assessment of respiratory status and cultures should be obtained if there are any signs of infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has been diagnosed with an upper extremity DVT. There is a risk of developing additional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and hypotension. He has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. He is also on heparin sodium, norepinephrine, KCl (CRRT), and calcium gluconate (CRRT). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 71 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 87/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 84% on a nasal cannula. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight has increased from 98.9 kg at admission to 103.4 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 8,778 mL and a total output of 11,241 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,463 mL. The patient's blood products show a total out of 3,238 mL. Respiratory support indicates the use of a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 84%. ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2 of 32 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, and base excess of -1 mEq/L. Physical examination reveals absent peripheral pulses and unassessed skin, neurologic status, and peripheral vascular status. Lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose, as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), and albumin (Albumin). Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has a history of smoking and alcohol abuse. The patient's condition is unstable, with ongoing hypotension, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, altered mental status, and elevated inflammatory markers, there is a possibility of sepsis.
2. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): With the presence of respiratory distress, renal dysfunction (elevated creatinine), and altered mental status, the patient may be at risk for MODS.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulcers.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing ongoing hypotension, which has been an ongoing problem. He is now on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and receiving low-dose levophed to allow volume removal with a plan for a trial of hemodialysis (HD) soon.

The patient has a history of not tolerating HD on the floor due to hypotension. His CHF is a major cause of respiratory insufficiency, and there is a possibility of pneumonia as well. However, his respiratory status has improved over the last few days, and he is currently on a nasal cannula.

The patient also has renal failure, for which CVVH has been initiated. It will be attempted to wean off norepinephrine and start oral midodrine in preparation for an HD run likely tomorrow. The patient has tolerated a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg.

Additionally, the patient has upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right internal jugular vein and left axillary vein. Heparin has been continued, and platelet monitoring will be done due to the patient's history of thrombocytopenia.

Regarding rhythm, digoxin was stopped, and amiod"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%, and a history of not tolerating hemodialysis (HD) on the floor due to hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and is receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has ongoing hypotension and requires low-dose norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. His respiratory status is compromised, possibly due to CHF and potential pneumonia. The patient is also dealing with renal failure, a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and will meet with them after the HD trial.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory insufficiency: CHF is a major cause, with possible pneumonia as well.
2. Renal failure: CVVH is being used, with plans to wean off norepinephrine and start oral midodrine in preparation for HD run likely tomorrow.
3. UE DVT: Continue heparin gtt. Monitor platelets given h/o thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%, and sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection or pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal failure. He also has anasarca, which is generalized swelling caused by fluid accumulation in the body tissues.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 89/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally, improving edema in the extremities, and right shoulder subluxation. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed due to confusion and delirium.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 129 K/uL, and renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 1"

","The patient in the ICU is being treated for multiple medical conditions, including heart failure, leukocytosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), renal failure, hypotension, coronary artery disease (CAD), pulmonary hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, and wheezing. The patient also has a dislocated shoulder and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/58 mmHg to 117/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on various medications, including levophed, heparin sodium, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, and others. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's current treatment plan involves continuing with CVVH, fluid removal, and medication adjustments as needed. The patient's prognosis is being closely monitored, and appropriate interventions are being implemented to manage their conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 98-year-old female with a chief complaint of dislocated shoulder. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including heart failure (CHF), leukocytosis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), renal failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), pulmonary hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), thrombocytopenia, hypotension, wheezing, and a history of GI bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure (CHF): The patient is experiencing both systolic and diastolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, which may indicate a new pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on heparin, indicating the presence of a DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which puts them at risk for ischemic heart disease.
6. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has risk factors for pulmonary hypertension and may have pulmonary embolism.
7. Urinary tract infection (UTI"

The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted to the ICU. He is not tolerating hemodialysis (HD) on the floor due to ongoing hypotension, which has been a problem. The patient is now receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and low-dose levophed to allow for volume removal with plans for a trial of HD soon. 

The patient recently had a 7-day antibiotic treatment course for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. He is also experiencing low-grade fevers overnight, possibly related to a urinary tract infection (UTI), with cultures pending. His respiratory insufficiency has improved over the last few days while on a nasal cannula.

The patient's plan for HD is as follows: midodrine to be increased to maximum dose, weaning from norepinephrine, and a trial HD run when hemodynamics are stable. 

The patient has a history of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with involvement of the right internal jugular vein and left axillary vein. Heparin infusion will be continued, and platelets will be monitored due to a history of thrombocytopenia. Monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) will also be done, considering the"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing problem with hypotension may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory insufficiency: While the patient's respiratory condition has improved recently, there is still a risk of worsening respiratory function due to possible pneumonia or progression of CHF.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing ESRD puts him at risk for further deterioration of renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's main issues include renal failure, sepsis, hypotension, fevers, respiratory insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), rhythm disturbances, shoulder subluxation, and difficulty tolerating hemodialysis (HD) on the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's ongoing renal failure and difficulty tolerating HD on the floor could increase the risk of developing AKI.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on antibiotics, but due to his compromised immune system, there is a risk of further infections leading to sepsis.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's CHF and ongoing hypotension may increase the risk of a cardiac arrest.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory insufficiency and possible pneumonia could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The presence of DVT increases the risk of a pulmonary embolism.
6. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's atrial flutter and previous use of digoxin may lead to further rhythm disturbances.
7. Shoulder Subluxation: The patient's shoulder subluxation may worsen, causing pain and potential complications.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and ongoing anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of re-bleeding.
9. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function abnormalities may progress to hepatic encephalopathy.
10. Multi-organ Failure: Due to the patient's critical illness and multiple organ dysfunction, there is a risk of multi-organ failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient has a history of heart failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic, acute on chronic. They have been diuresed but continue to retain fluid. CVVH has been stopped, and they are now attempting to wean off levophed while monitoring blood pressure.

2. The patient is suspected to have a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and is being continued on heparin.

3. The patient is experiencing renal failure, specifically end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Renal planning includes attempting hemodialysis (HD) today.

4. The patient has coronary artery disease (CAD) with ischemic heart disease. Although CP was performed without evidence of ischemia on ECG, multiple blocks were seen, indicating old CAD.

5. The patient is also diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) and is considering a repeat echo after diuresis.

6. The patient presents with a urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by a dirty urine analysis and low-grade fever. Zosyn has been started empirically, and consideration is being given to changing back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] pending culture and sensitivities.

7. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and is being treated with digoxin, while amiodarone is being held.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic heart failure, systolic and diastolic. He has been experiencing hypotension requiring increasing doses of norepinephrine and levophed, as well as confusion and urinary incontinence. The patient also has a history of chronic renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, including E. coli in the urine. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coronary artery disease (CAD), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). His current medications include digoxin, midodrine, heparin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure Exacerbation: The patient's chronic heart failure appears to be worsening, as evidenced by his low blood pressure and the need for increasing doses of vasopressors.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is currently on CVVH. He is scheduled for HD tomorrow, which will help manage his renal failure.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a new urine analysis showing many polymorphonuclear leukocytes, indicating a possible UTI.

   hypotension, which has been an ongoing problem. [**Name (NI) 59**] clear etiology other
   than just poor cardiac function. Now on CVVH.  Receiving low-dose
   levophed to allow volume removal with plan for trial of HD today.
 SHOCK - remains pressor dependent, sepsis versus cardiogenic vs. ?
   - cont midodrine, wean levophed as tolerated, MAP>55-60
   - check adrenal axis with random cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   - low grade febrile yesterday (see below), but sepsis seems unlikely
   - holding all anti-HTN medications
 FEVER
 low grade yesterday, source unclear
   - f/u blood cultures, consider culture from HD line to assess for
   colonization
   - continue meropenem today (started [**11-6**])

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient is admitted to the ICU for hypertensive emergency and pulmonary edema, and is intolerant of hemodialysis (HD) due to hypertensive urgency. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, and ongoing hypotension despite low-dose levophed. The patient remains pressor-dependent and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is a concern for shock, but the etiology is unclear. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic renal failure. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests. Imaging reveals a worsening right pleural effusion. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 117/58 mmHg, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination shows bilateral absent peripheral pulses, diminished breath sounds on the right side, and trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

   hypotension, which has been an ongoing problem. [**Name (NI) 59**] clear etiology other
   than just poor cardiac function. Now on CVVH.  Receiving low-dose
   levophed to allow volume removal with plan for trial of HD today.
 SHOCK - remains pressor dependent, sepsis versus cardiogenic vs. ?
   - cont midodrine, wean levophed as tolerated, MAP>55-60
   - check adrenal axis with random cortisol +/- [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   - low grade febrile yesterday (see below), but sepsis seems unlikely
   - holding all anti-HTN medications
 FEVER
 low grade yesterday, source unclear

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of chronic renal failure, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), deep vein thrombosis, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure, acute heart failure on top of chronic heart failure, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, and atrial fibrillation.

24-hour events:
- Tolerated hemodialysis (HD) on levophed.
- Unable to wean levophed after HD.
- Transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during HD.
- Random cortisol checked at 16.3.
- Started Florinef 0.1 mg daily.

Allergies:
- Percocet (oral), which contains oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen.

Medications:
- Norepinephrine (norepinephrine) infusion at 0.04 mcg/kg/min.
- Heparin sodium infusion at 500 units/hour.
- Other ICU medications and routine medications are also being administered.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data:
- Vital signs: Temperature at 37.8Â°C (100Â°F), heart rate (HR) at 68 bpm, blood pressure (BP) at 106/47 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100% on nasal cannula.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg.
- Fluid balance indicates a total input of 1,615 mL and total output of 2,000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 385 mL.
- Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula, with SpO2 at 100%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.
- Physical examination findings include well-nourished general appearance, PERRL eyes/conjunctiva, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, and not assessed skin.
- Neurologic examination reveals the patient to be oriented.

Assessment and plan:
1. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD).
   - Continue to wean down levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue midodrine, added florinef.
   - Attempt to run on HD tomorrow.
2. Heart failure (CHF), systolic and diastolic, acute on chronic.
   - Diuresis from HD.
   - Continue digoxin.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI).

   - Consider repeat echo after diuresis.
7. Atrial fibrillation (AFib).
   - On digoxin, holding amio.
8. Thrombocytopenia, chronic.
   - Following plts; HIT neg x2 with neg serotonin release assay.

Other issues:
1. Dislocated shoulder.
   - Splint and exercises.
2. H/o GI bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools if Hct drops.
   - 1 unit PRBC transfused.

ICU care:
- Nutrition: To be determined.
- Glycemic control: To be determined.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently in the ICU. He has been experiencing hypotension and is being supported with norepinephrine infusion. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis in his upper extremity, thrombocytopenia, and a dislocated shoulder.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100Â°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a systolic murmur.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and there is an increased band percentage. The platelet count is low. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, but the calcium level is slightly low. The cortisol level is elevated.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, heparin, midodrine, Florinef, digoxin, and meropenem. He is also receiving daily dialysis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30%. The patient presents with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis (HD) for one month prior to admission. Persistent hypotension on the order of 100/44 mmHg despite volume resuscitation led to a transfer to the MICU. The patient remains dependent on vasopressors for unclear reasons.

The patient tolerated HD with vasopressors on board and has been on random cortisol 16.3 while on pressors, with florinef started. The temperature of the patient yesterday was [**Age over 90**]. Blood cultures were obtained from venipuncture at [**2167-11-7**] 11:50 AM, from the HD line at [**2167-11-7**] 01:40 PM, and from the HD line at [**2167-11-7**] 01:50 PM.

The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy. Allergies include Percocet (oral) (oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen). The last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2167-11-6**] 05:07 AM, and meropenem on [**2167-11-7**] 12:49 PM.

Infusions include norepinephrine at 0.02 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium at 500 units/hour. Other ICU medications include colace, simvastatin, nephrocaps, neurontin, prozac, asa, digoxin, SSI, midodrine, and florinef.

There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data as of [**2167-11-8**] 10:30 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and neurological assessment.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, chronically ill appearing, with poor dentition. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, but diminished breath sounds on the right side. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. Extremities show trace edema on the left side, with a history of right below-knee amputation (BKA). Neurologic examination reveals that the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person. Movement, tone, and other neurologic findings are not assessed.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, leukocyte count"

   80 yo M w/ ESRD, CAD, CVA, CHF (EF 30%) presents with syncopal episodes
   at HD for 1 month prior to admission.  Persistent HOTN and the
   inability to tolerate dialysis led to a MICU transfer.  He did not
   respond to volume removal on CVVH and remains dependent on vasopressors
   for unclear reasons.
 SHOCK, OTHER - etiology remains unclear, remains pressor dependent,
   no source of infection identified despite low grade fevers.
   Cardiogenic shock seems unlikely given exam (warm)
   - change florinef to hydrocortisone 50 mg q6h
   - cont midodrine, digoxin
   - will continue to try to wean levophed
 FEVER - low grade, no source identified, in past family refused
   thoracentesis
   - remains on meropenem though UCx only yeast (will leave on for today
   give plan to reassess status tomorrow)
   - will check LFTs now, consider RUQ U/S

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis for one month prior to admission. The patient has persistent hypotension (HOTN) and an inability to tolerate dialysis, leading to a transfer to the MICU. The patient remains dependent on vasopressors for unclear reasons.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/44 mmHg to 125/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH of 7.31.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, diminished breath sounds in the chest, trace edema in the lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person but somnolent.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin at 9.1 g/dL, hematocrit at 26.9%, platelet count at 121,000/mm3, creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and various medical complications. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to shock of unclear etiology, requiring vasopressors. He has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and renal failure. The patient's fever has not been resolved despite antibiotic therapy, and he is also experiencing low-grade fever. His vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels. Imaging reveals a right pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, which may lead to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of recurrent arrhythmias, which can further compromise cardiac output and hemodynamic stability.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function. If not addressed promptly, AKI may progress and worsen the patient's overall condition.
4. Pulmonary Complications: The presence of a right pleural effusion could potentially lead to respiratory distress and compromised gas exchange if it continues to accumulate.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient"

   80 yo M w/ ESRD, CAD, CVA, CHF (EF 30%) presents with syncopal episodes
   at HD for 1 month prior to admission.  Persistent HOTN and the
   inability to tolerate dialysis led to a MICU transfer.  He did not
   respond to volume removal on CVVH and remains dependent on vasopressors
   for unclear reasons.
 SHOCK, OTHER - etiology remains unclear, remains pressor dependent,
   no source of infection identified despite low grade fevers.
   Cardiogenic shock seems unlikely given exam (warm)
   - change florinef to hydrocortisone 50 mg q6h
   - cont midodrine, digoxin
   - will continue to try to wean levophed
 FEVER - low grade, no source identified, in past family refused

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis (HD) for one month prior to admission. The patient has persistent hypotension (HOTN) and the inability to tolerate dialysis, leading to a MICU transfer. He did not respond to volume removal on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and remains dependent on vasopressors for unclear reasons.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock, other - The patient is experiencing shock, but the etiology is unclear. The patient remains pressor-dependent and no source of infection has been identified despite low-grade fevers.

2. Fever - The patient has had low-grade fevers, but no source of infection has been identified. The patient's family refused thoracentesis, and the patient is currently on meropenem. However, the only positive culture is yeast in the upper central line.

3. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity - The patient has a DVT in the upper extremity, and heparin drip is being continued.

4. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD) - The patient has ESRD, and his electrolytes are currently within normal range"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at home for one month prior to admission. The patient has persistent hypotension and is unable to tolerate dialysis, leading to a transfer to the medical ICU. The patient did not respond to volume removal on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and remains dependent on vasopressors for unclear reasons. The patient is also experiencing shock of unclear etiology, fever with no identified source, and has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity. The patient's current medications include midodrine, digoxin, hydrocortisone, and meropenem. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7Â°C, heart rate 74 bpm, blood pressure 107/45 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 93% on nasal cannula, and CVP 10 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of CHF and current symptoms of hypotension and shock, there is a potential risk of cardiogenic shock. This can be assessed by evaluating the patient's cardiac function and response to fluid resuscitation and vasop"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at home for one month prior to admission. He was transferred to the medical ICU due to persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis. The patient required norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure during continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Despite removal of fluid, he did not respond to volume removal on CVVH. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 107/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing right-sided pleural effusion, which is worsening as shown on chest X-ray. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose, and lactic acid levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, but his albumin level is low. The patient's platelet count is slightly low, and his prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and INR are elevated. The patient's CK/MB and troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible myocardial injury. He is currently on multiple medications including hydrocortisone, midodrine, digoxin, meropenem, heparin, aspirin, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of CHF and current presentation suggest a possible cardiogenic shock. However, the warm extremities and lack of other signs of cardiogenic shock make this less likely.
2. Infection: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is concern about the right-sided pleural effusion as a possible source of infection. The family's refusal to drain the effusion poses a challenge in identifying and treating the source of infection.
3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of an upper extremity DVT. He is currently on a heparin drip to prevent further clot formation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on dialysis. His renal function is further compromised with elevated creatinine levels.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest possible myocardial injury. He is currently being treated with aspirin and statins.
6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is rate-controlled on digoxin for his AFib.
7. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a worsening right-sided pleural effusion, which could lead to respiratory complications"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at home dialysis for one month prior to admission. He has been experiencing persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis, leading to a transfer to the medical ICU. In the ICU, he did not respond to volume removal on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and remains dependent on vasopressors for unclear reasons. The patient is currently off norepinephrine since 10 AM. His examination is warm, making cardiogenic shock unlikely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's dependence on vasopressors suggests ongoing hypotension, indicating a potential complication of shock. However, the etiology of the shock remains unclear.
2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers without an identified source. This could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed upper extremity DVT and is currently on heparin drip.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis. His renal function should be closely monitored, and adjustments made to his treatment plan accordingly.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis for one month prior to admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of chronic coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 107/45 to 116/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. 

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and various medications for his conditions. He has received antibiotics (meropenem) for sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactic acid, indicating possible renal dysfunction and metabolic acidosis. The platelet count is slightly low, suggesting thrombocytopenia. Other lab values, including electrolytes and enzymes, are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral pulses assessed, indicating potential circulatory issues. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute on chronic coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/45 mmHg to 116/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula, and temperature within normal limits.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,186 mL over the past 24 hours, with an output of 0 mL. The patient's weight has decreased from 98.9 kg at admission to 90.5 kg currently.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose. The white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range, while the hemoglobin (Hct) is slightly lower than normal. Platelet count (Plt) is also slightly low. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes confusion/delirium as an allergy, and he has been receiving meropenem antibiotics. He is on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the elevated levels of creatinine and decreased urine output"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypotension, and heart failure. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, acute on chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%, urinary tract infection/pleural effusion with yeast infection, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD puts him at risk for further renal complications, such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections.

2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute on chronic heart failure may lead to worsening cardiac function, pulmonary edema, fluid overload, and decreased cardiac output.

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could indicate inadequate organ perfusion and may contribute to multiorgan dysfunction.

4. Infection: The presence of a pleural effusion with yeast infection suggests a possible ongoing infectious process. The patient is currently on meropenem empirically for hypotension and concern for parapneumonic effusion risk. There is a risk of developing sepsis or septic shock.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an existing DVT in the upper extremity, and he is receiving heparin"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypotension requiring pressor support, and heart failure. The patient's current conditions include renal failure, heart failure, urinary tract infection/pleural effusion, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation. The patient also has chronic thrombocytopenia and a negative result for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 

The patient is currently on hemodialysis and receiving pressor support for hypotension. The patient's electrolytes and anion gap are stable. Midodrine is being continued, and steroids have been discontinued due to normal cortisol levels indicating no adrenal insufficiency. The goals of care for the patient today include managing heart failure, minimizing urine output, and diuresis as per hemodialysis. The patient is also on digoxin for heart failure. 

Regarding the urinary tract infection/pleural effusion, yeast only was cultured, and the patient has a continued right pleural effusion. The patient has been on meropenem empirically for hypotension and concern for parapneumonic effusion risk. The course of meropenem will be completed for 8 days. 

For the DVT in the upper extremity, the patient is continuing with heparin and will likely"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypotension requiring pressor support during HD, and heart failure. The patient's recent history includes urinary tract infection/pleural effusion with yeast only cultured, minimal urine output, diuresis as per HD, and continued use of digoxin. The patient has also been on meropenem empirically for hypotension and concern for parapneumonic effusion risk.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's systolic and diastolic heart failure may worsen due to ongoing hypotension and inadequate cardiac function.
2. Infection: The patient has been on meropenem for a suspected urinary tract infection and pleural effusion, which may lead to antibiotic resistance or other complications.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is planned to start coumadin for anticoagulation. There is a risk of developing further thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Chronic thrombocytopenia: The patient has fluctuating low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications during procedures like thoracentesis.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on digoxin. There is a risk of worsening arrhythmias"

   80 yo M w/ ESRD, CAD, CVA, CHF (EF 30%) presents with syncopal episodes
   at HD for 1 month prior to admission.  Persistent HOTN and the
   inability to tolerate dialysis led to a MICU transfer.  He did not
   respond to volume removal on CVVH and has been mostly norepinephrine
   requiring to tolerate runs of CVVH.
 SHOCK, OTHER - etiology remains unclear, now off NE since 10AM [**11-8**],
   no source of infection identified despite low grade fevers.
   Cardiogenic shock seems unlikely given exam (warm)
   - cont midodrine, digoxin

 FEVER - low grade, no source identified, All clx have been neg. Will
   likely perform a thoracentesis
   - remains on meropenem ([**11-6**])  though UCx only yeast, arguably his WBC
   has improved and we will cont a course until after thoracentesis
   - Decub film and AP film for effusion with plan for thoracentesis
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), UPPER EXTREMITY
   - continue heparin drip with plan to start coumadin post thoracentesis
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   - electrolytes ok, tolerated HD on pressors yesterday
   - trial HD with no pressors  [**11-9**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes during hemodialysis for one month prior to admission. He has persistent hypotension and is unable to tolerate dialysis, leading to a transfer to the medical ICU. The patient requires norepinephrine to tolerate continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and shows signs of shock, but the etiology is unclear. He also has a low-grade fever with no identified source, and the possibility of performing a thoracentesis is being considered. The patient has been on meropenem since November 6th, although upper and lower central line cultures have been negative, with only yeast growth in the upper line culture. His white blood cell count has improved, and he will continue the course until after the thoracentesis. Chest X-rays have been ordered to evaluate for effusion, with a plan for thoracentesis. The patient has been diagnosed with an upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and will continue with heparin drip and plan to start coumadin post-thoracentesis. He also has renal failure and is on dialysis. A new finding of thrombocytopenia has been noted, and a repeat CBC with smear will be performed to confirm"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presents with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis for one month prior to admission. The patient has been in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis.

The patient is currently off pressors and there is no evidence of shock. The etiology of the patient's condition remains unclear. He is also off neuromuscular blocking agents (NE) since November 8th.

The patient has a low-grade fever, but no source of infection has been identified. All cultures have been negative. A thoracentesis is planned today to investigate the cause of the fever.

The patient has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity. He is receiving heparin drip and will start on coumadin after the thoracentesis.

The patient has renal failure and is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). He tolerated HD on pressors yesterday and a trial HD with no pressors was done on November 9th.

A new finding of thrombocytopenia has been identified. A repeat CBC with smear will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The cause of thrombocytopenia does not appear to be consistent"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes during hemodialysis for one month prior to admission. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis. The patient is currently off pressors and not in shock. He has been experiencing low-grade fevers without an identified source of infection, and no signs of cardiogenic shock are present based on the physical examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. FEVER - low-grade fever with no source identified.
2. DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), UPPER EXTREMITY - the patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization and other risk factors.
3. RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (ESRD) - the patient has pre-existing ESRD and may experience further deterioration in renal function.
4. THROMBOCYTOPENIA - the patient has a new finding of thrombocytopenia, which needs further evaluation.
5. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) - the patient has a history of CAD, which can lead to ischemic heart disease and potential complications.
6. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) - the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at home for one month prior to admission. The patient has been in the MICU for persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis. He did not respond to volume removal on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has been mostly norepinephrine requiring to tolerate runs of CVVH. The etiology of shock remains unclear, and the patient is now off norepinephrine since 10 AM on 11/8. No source of infection has been identified despite low-grade fevers. Cardiogenic shock seems unlikely given the examination findings of warmth.

The patient has a fever, but no source has been identified. The family has refused thoracentesis to investigate the pleural effusion as a possible source. The patient is still on meropenem, although the ultrasound (UCx) only showed yeast, and his white blood cell count has improved. It will continue until a clear plan regarding the pleural effusion is made. Consent from the son will be needed for a large volume thoracentesis.

The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, and heparin drip will be continued. The patient's renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypotension requiring pressor support, and acute on chronic heart failure (CHF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic thrombocytopenia, and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity. The patient underwent a thoracentesis, which was complicated by a small pneumothorax. He is currently on a heparin drip and has been started on Coumadin. The patient has been treated empirically for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a possible parapneumonic pleural effusion, but subsequent tests have not confirmed infection. His vital signs are stable, but he has decreased breath sounds at the base of the lungs with crackles on the right side. He has a central venous catheter for dialysis and a multi-lumen central line. His platelet count has fluctuated, and he is at risk for bleeding during the thoracentesis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently on the floor for observation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to pleural effusion and potential infection.
2. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient underwent thoracentesis, removing 1500cc of fluid from the chest cavity. He is on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/52 to 130/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on nasal cannula for respiratory support. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 573 mL and output of 1500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 927 mL. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, while platelet count is within normal range. Electrolytes are relatively stable, with slight abnormalities in potassium and magnesium levels. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal limits. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating do not resuscitate/do not intubate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels suggest a possible infection. Close monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypotension, and heart failure. The patient presented with acute-on-chronic heart failure, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient also has a urinary tract infection/pleural effusion, with yeast cultured from the pleural fluid. The patient is currently on meropenem empirically for hypotension and concern for parapneumonic effusion risk. A thoracentesis was performed today to assess the right lung field, and further tests are pending.

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient is also experiencing chronic thrombocytopenia, with fluctuating low platelets. The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) is being managed with digoxin, and amiodarone is held. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires regular hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and accumulation of waste products.

2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute-on-chronic heart failure may worsen, leading to symptoms such as short"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic thrombocytopenia. He presented to the ICU with hypotension and was found to have a right-sided pleural effusion. The effusion was tapped, resulting in a small pneumothorax that required the placement of a chest tube. Laboratory results from the pleural fluid were negative for infection and malignancy. The patient is currently on heparin and warfarin for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient experienced a small pneumothorax during thoracentesis, which required the placement of a chest tube. This complication can cause respiratory distress and may require further intervention.
2. Infection: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for suspected parapneumonic effusion. There is a risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, especially since the patient is immunocompromised due to ESRD and CHF.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, and he has experienced a significant drop in platelets recently. This puts him at risk for bleeding complications, particularly during procedures such as thoracentesis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on anticoagulation therapy."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis (HD) for one month prior to admission. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis. The patient is now off pressors and afebrile for 48 hours without any identified source of infection. Thoracentesis was performed and the effusion was determined to be transudative, ruling out an infectious etiology. The patient has completed a 10-day course of oral levofloxacin. A small, asymptomatic right-sided pneumothorax has resolved on chest X-ray (CXR) on [11-11]. The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and is currently on a heparin drip and coumadin with an INR goal of 2-8. The patient tolerated hemodialysis without the need for pressors. He continues to receive aspirin and a statin for coronary artery disease, and digoxin for rate control in atrial fibrillation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37Â°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 2.8 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.7 mmol/L. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. Other lab results, including electrolyte levels and cardiac markers, are also provided. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and he is expected to be transferred to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at home for one month prior to admission. The patient was transferred to the medical ICU due to persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis. The patient is currently off pressors, experiencing low-grade fever without identified source, and has a small right-sided pleural effusion that is not infectious in etiology (transudative effusion). The patient also has a small, asymptomatic right-sided pneumothorax and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity. The patient's medical conditions include renal failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever without identified source suggests a potential underlying infection that needs further investigation and treatment.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient's small right-sided pleural effusion requires follow-up CXR and pleural fluid cytology to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient's small, asymptomatic right-sided pneumothorax needs close monitoring and follow-up CXR to assess for any progression or development of symptoms.

   decline with HD once he leaves the ICU, he will be made CMO with no
   plans for pressor support either. He will discuss with his sister [**Name (NI) 6361**]
   and [**Name (NI) 179**] too but this is what he prefers too for his father

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis for one month prior to admission. He has persistent hypotension and an inability to tolerate dialysis, leading to a transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient is now off pressors and febrile for 48 hours without a source identified. Thoracentesis is not infectious in etiology, but may benefit from a repeat therapeutic tap in the next 24 hours as a bridge to helping with hemodialysis and tachypnea. Negative culture data from thoracentesis favors completing a 10-day course with oral levofloxacin (starting on [**11-6**]) and follow-up pleural fluid cytology. The patient has a small, resolved right-sided pleural effusion (PTX) on [**11-11**] chest X-ray. He has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and will continue with a heparin drip and now on coumadin (INR goal [**2-8**]). The patient tolerated hemodialysis with no pressors. He has coronary artery disease (CAD) and will continue with aspirin and statin. The patient is also on digoxin for rate control in atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo M w/ ESRD, CAD, CVA, CHF (EF 30%) presents with syncopal episodes
   at HD for 1 month prior to admission.  Persistent HOTN and the
   inability to tolerate dialysis led to a MICU transfer. He is now off
   pressors and
 SHOCK, OTHER - etiology remains unclear, now off NE since 10AM [**11-8**],
   no source of infection identified despite low grade fevers.
   Cardiogenic shock seems unlikely given exam (warm)
   - cont midodrine, digoxin and will keep off steroids for now for
   possible adrenal insufficiency

 FEVER - low grade, no source identified, All clx have been neg. Will
   likely perform a thoracentesis today.
   - remains on meropenem ([**11-6**])  though UCx only yeast, arguably his WBC
   has improved and we will cont a course until after thoracentesis
   > PTX: small right sided, asymptomatic
   - Follow up CXR
   - 100% NRB
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), UPPER EXTREMITY
   - continue heparin drip with plan to start coumadin post thoracentesis
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD): tolerated
   HD with no pressors
   - electrolytes ok, tolerated HD on pressors yesterday
   > Thrombocytopenia: new finding. Will repeat CBC to confirm with
   smear.  Does not appear to be consistent with HIT (has been HIT neg),
   TTP or antibody mediated process.
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE
   - continue ASA. statin
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - rate controlled on digoxin

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with syncopal episodes at hemodialysis for one month prior to admission. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension and inability to tolerate dialysis, leading to a transfer to the medical ICU. The patient is currently off pressors and not in shock. He has low-grade fevers with no identified source of infection, and a planned thoracentesis is scheduled today. The patient also has a small right-sided pleural effusion, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, and renal failure. Other notable findings include thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural Effusion: The small right-sided pleural effusion may require further evaluation and management. Thoracentesis is planned to analyze the fluid and determine the underlying cause.
2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT in the upper extremity. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin drip and planned initiation of coumadin post-thoracentesis is appropriate for DVT treatment and prevention of pulmonary embolism.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is"
