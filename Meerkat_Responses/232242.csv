","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and is now in the ICU. She presented with fevers and tachycardia. The patient has a history of allergies to Vicodin, adhesive tape, lisinopril, and an unknown allergy. She was started on IV fluids, antibiotics, and has a PICC line inserted. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/69 mmHg to 146/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her blood cultures, urine culture, and chest X-ray have been taken. Imaging shows a significant decrease in bilateral pneumoperitoneum, residual pneumoperitoneum underneath the right hemidiaphragm, atelectasis in the left lower lobe, and mild enlargement of the heart. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of fevers and atelectasis increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, leukocytosis, and potential bacteremia, there is a risk of sepsis, especially considering the recent surgery.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and exploratory laparotomy due to concern for free air under the diaphragm. She is currently on day 4 of her hospital stay and has been experiencing fevers and tachycardia. The patient's abdominal pain has decreased, and she is feeling better. She has a history of allergies to Vicodin, adhesive tape, and lisinopril, which caused a rash. She also has a cough when taking antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), current temperature of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate of 101 bpm (with a normal range of 95-130 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 121/69 mmHg to 146/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 15-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in abdominal pain. Her allergies, medical and family history remain unchanged. The patient has been started on IV fluids and antibiotics. Her blood cultures are pending. 

Imaging reveals a significant decrease in bilateral pneumoperitoneum with residual pneumoperitoneum seen underneath the right hemidiaphragm. Left lower lobe atelectasis and right"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and exploratory laparotomy. She was initially admitted for abdominal pain, but the surgery was complicated by free air, leading to a return to the operating room. 

The patient's recent events include receiving 2.5 liters of normal saline, with improved urine output and tachycardia. She is on dilaudid PCA for pain management and has been restarted on Cipro and Flagyl. Blood cultures were taken on 03/29/2154 at 03:49 PM, and a PICC line was started at 04:07 PM. 

The patient has allergies to Vicodin (oral), adhesive tape (topical), lisinopril (oral), and cough. She received antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin) on 03/29/2154 at 09:25 PM and (metronidazole) on 03/30/2154 at 08:00 AM. 

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except for cardiovascular symptoms of tachycardia and nutritional support being NPO (nothing by mouth). 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature is 38.2 C (100.7 F), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, heart rate is 99 bpm, respiratory rate is 17 breaths"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and exploratory laparotomy (ex lap) due to a several-month history of abdominal pain. She was initially admitted to the ICU for increased pneumoperitoneum with fever but without evidence of perforation. The patient has a history of central sleep apnea and risk for hypoxemic events. Her vital signs are stable, but she is tachycardic and has improved urine output after fluid resuscitation. The patient is receiving pain management with Dilaudid PCA and restarted on Cipro/Flagyl antibiotics. 

Physical examination reveals tenderness in the abdomen with rebound and left upper quadrant (LUQ) square emphysema. The patient is alert, oriented, and follows commands. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low calcium and magnesium levels. Microbiology results from the laparoscopic gram stain are negative, and blood cultures are pending. 

Plan:
1. Cardiovascular: Continue metoprolol for peri-op beta blockade and hypertension control. Monitor for any complications.
2. Neuro: Provide pain control with PCA.
3. Endocrine: Maintain sliding scale insulin for diabetes management.
4. Fluid/Electrolyte: Monitor fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
5. Gastrointestinal: Discuss when tube feeds can be started"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and exploratory laparotomy on day 5 due to concern for free air under the diaphragm. She is now on post-operative day (POD) 3. The patient's current condition is improving with volume resuscitation and antibiotics, but she still has limited urine output. Foley flushing did not reveal any blockage, suggesting that the patient may be volume depleted. Serial abdominal exams will be continued to monitor her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume depletion: The patient's continued limited urine output and improvement with volume resuscitation suggest that she may be volume depleted. This can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

2. Infection: The patient is on a prolonged course of antibiotics for a total of 14 days, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to the surgical procedure or the presence of micro-perforation as mentioned in the progress note. Infections can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.

3. Diabetes management: The patient has diabetes, and her blood glucose levels should be closely monitored. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infection and delay wound healing.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis. This is important as immobility from surgery increases the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient's urine output has been poor, with a FeNA less than 1%. The patient received 500 cc Hespan overnight and then Lasix per surgery. They have multiple allergies, including Vicodin (oral), adhesive tape (topical), lisinopril (oral), and an unknown allergy. The patient was given antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole) and other medications such as pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and pain medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/73 mmHg to 97/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they have good fluid balance. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. The patient appears alert and in better spirits. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the abdomen with rebound tenderness and left upper quadrant squamous emphysema. Neurologically, the patient is awake, oriented, and follows commands. Lab results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. Urine analysis shows trace leukocytes and positive nitrates. The patient is receiving ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and is being monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Urinary tract infection: The presence of trace leukocytes in the urine suggests a possible infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and surgical procedures.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for stress ulcers, indicating a risk for these complications.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia while receiving mechanical ventilation.
5. Abdominal complications: The tenderness and rebound tenderness in the abdomen suggest possible abdominal complications such as peritonitis or abscess formation.
6. Fluid imbalance: Although the patient has good fluid balance, the poor urine output may indicate a risk for fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances."

The patient is a 62-year-old woman who underwent a sigmoid colectomy and exploratory laparotomy. She was admitted to the ICU for increased pneumoperitoneum with fever, but without evidence of perforation. The patient has a history of several months of abdominal pain. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been doing well post-extubation.
