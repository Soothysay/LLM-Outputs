","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting consistent with acute pancreatitis. She was admitted with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, indicating possible septic shock. The patient responded well to IV fluids and vasopressin, suggesting improvement in her condition. Further evaluation revealed gallstone pancreatitis as the likely etiology. The patient has several comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and mild dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggests septic shock. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, elevated lipase levels, and imaging findings are consistent with acute pancreatitis. Complications of pancreatitis include pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic complications such as organ failure.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and possible CHF or CAD. She is currently V-paced on EKG, indicating a cardiac rhythm abnormality. There is also concern for anticoagulation given her CHADS score of 3. Cardiac complications could include arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old female with acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting consistent with acute pancreatitis.
- She presented with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, indicating potential septic shock.
- The patient responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses but quickly experienced a drop in blood pressure. She was then placed on Vasopressin with sustained improvement in her mean arterial pressures (MAPs).
- The likely etiology of her hypotension and fever is gallstone pancreatitis, considering her clinical, radiologic, and hematologic findings.
- The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation, but unclear cardiac history, with a CHADS score of 3 indicating a need for anticoagulation.
- The patient also has a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and mild dementia.
- She is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, IVF boluses, Desmopressin, pain control with IV Morphine, Zofran for nausea, and ERCP in the morning.
- The patient's family has indicated a do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and elevated lipase levels suggest acute pancreatitis. Complications can include infection, organ failure, and persistent pain.

2. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension indicates potential septic shock. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Gallstone pancreatitis: Given the patient's clinical and radiologic findings, gallstone pancreatitis is likely. Complications can include ongoing abdominal pain, infection, and biliary complications such as cholangitis.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and unclear cardiac history suggest potential cardiac complications. These can include arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of thromboembolic events.

5. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD may predispose her to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.

6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and pending blood cultures suggest a possible infection. This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly.

7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's abnormal kidney function tests indicate potential renal dysfunction. This can be exacerbated by the use of nephrotoxic drugs and inadequate fluid management.

8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism requires ongoing management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female presenting with acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting consistent with acute pancreatitis. The patient also has several other medical conditions including atrial fibrillation, COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and mild dementia.

The patient's initial presentation included fever, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), and hypotension. Despite receiving intravenous fluids (IVF), her blood pressure remained low. The patient was subsequently placed on vasopressin, which improved her blood pressure to mid-to-upper 60s.

The patient's labs show elevated levels of amylase and lipase, indicating pancreatitis. Imaging studies also confirm the presence of acute pancreatitis. The patient's lactate level has improved from 3.3 to 1.6, and her Ranson criteria score is currently 4, estimating approximately 15% mortality.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but it is unclear why she is not on anticoagulation therapy. She also has a history of diabetes mellitus, but reportedly not on any medications as an outpatient. The patient's COPD history is unknown, and she does not typically use oxygen at baseline but is wheezy on examination. She has a history of hypothyroidism and mild dementia.

The patient's current plan includes continuing antibiotics, monitoring blood cultures, providing IVF"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting consistent with acute pancreatitis. She also had signs of septic shock, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF) and vasopressin, indicating improvement in her blood pressure. 

The patient's condition suggests gallstone pancreatitis, considering her clinical, radiologic, and hematologic findings. She was admitted to the ICU for further management. 

The assessment and plan include continuing antibiotics, following up on blood cultures, providing IVF boluses as needed, continuing desmopressin, clarifying goals of care with the patient and her daughter, and considering an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the morning. 

Other medical conditions identified include atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and mild dementia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis.

2. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension indicates septic shock. If not properly managed, septic shock can progress to multiple"

","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is abdominal pain. They have been receiving IV fluids and vasopressin to improve their mean arterial pressure (MAP) since admission. There are no known drug allergies. The patient has been given Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) as the last dose of antibiotics at 05:43 AM. They are currently receiving vasopressin at a rate of 2.4 units per hour and other ICU medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/48 to 117/54 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is paced.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,880 mL and total output of 341 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,539 mL. They are receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and have been on respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 23.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 35.1%, platelet count (Plt) at 212 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.1 mg/dL, total CO2 (TCO2) at 31, glucose at 129 mg/dL, and lactic acid at 1.3 mmol/L. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, alkalinization, T Bili, amylase/lipase, differential white blood cell count, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are also provided.

The patient's blood culture is pending. The patient's medical and family history have not changed, and their current status is DNR/DNI. They will continue to be monitored in the ICU."

   CT. On admission lactate was 3.3 but quickly trended down to 1.6,
   lipase 6260 and elevated Tbili and Alk Phos supportive of the diagnosis
   of pancreatitis. Patient underwent ERCP on [**1-31**] which revelaed no
   stones but biliary sludge was noted, a sphrincterotomy performed and
   pancreatic duct stent placed. Labs are currently trending down. Patient
   returned for ERCP intubated and sedated. Upon returning to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   sedation was stopped and patient was extubated successfully.
   - will need pancreatic stent removed via ERCP in 1 week

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient was admitted with acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting consistent with acute pancreatitis. The elevated lipase levels (6260) and elevated liver enzymes (Tbili and Alk Phos) support this diagnosis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed no stones but biliary sludge was noted, and a sphincterotomy was performed with pancreatic duct stent placement.

2. Bleeding: The patient had an episode of maroon stools this morning, likely bleeding post-procedure. This indicates a possible complication from the ERCP procedure. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.

3. Infection: The patient was admitted with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which raised concerns for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome). The patient is currently afebrile and the WBC count is trending down, suggesting an improvement. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and to trend fevers and WBC count.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, has a pacemaker, and is being V-paced. The patient's CHADS score is 3, indicating a moderate risk for stroke, but she is not currently on Coumadin. It is important to restart met"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, as indicated by elevated lipase levels and imaging findings.
2. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed no stones but showed biliary sludge. A sphincterotomy was performed, and a pancreatic duct stent was placed.
3. The patient returned from the ERCP intubated and sedated but was successfully extubated after sedation was stopped.
4. The patient is currently receiving IVF hydration, pain control with IV morphine, and anti-nausea medication (Zofran) as needed.
5. The patient's labs are trending down, indicating improvement. However, liver function tests (LFTs) are still abnormal.
6. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) but is now afebrile while in the ICU.
7. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, is currently V-paced, and has a CHADS score of 3. The patient is not on Coumadin, and cardiac medications were held on admission.
8. The patient has an unknown history of COPD but does not use oxygen at baseline. Wheezing was noted on examination, so albuterol and ipratropium nebs are being given every 6 hours, and oxygen is being weaned as tolerated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient presented with symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis, including abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting. Lab results also indicate elevated lipase and liver enzymes, which support the diagnosis. The ERCP procedure revealed biliary sludge, and a pancreatic duct stent was placed. The patient will need the stent removed via ERCP in one week. Complications associated with acute pancreatitis can include infected pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

2. SIRS/?Septic shock: The patient was admitted with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, indicating a possible systemic inflammatory response. In the ICU, the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) was in the mid-50s, suggesting septic shock. Although the patient has been weaned off Vasopressin and is currently hypertensive, ongoing monitoring is necessary. Complications associated with septic shock can include multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a pacemaker and is being ventricularly paced (V-paced). It is unclear why the patient is not on Coumadin, considering their CHADS score of 3, which warrants anticoag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, dementia, renal failure, chronic anemia, hypotension, pain control, atrial fibrillation, acute pancreatitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently receiving various medications and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress Ulcer Disease: The patient's critical condition and use of medications like corticosteroids or H2 blockers may predispose him to stress ulcer disease.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's pre-existing renal failure and potential for fluid overload and nephrotoxic medications increase the risk of AKI.
6. Pancreatitis Complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
7. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD makes him susceptible to further exacerbations, particularly due to the stress of critical illness."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3480**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking female who presented with
   acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, & vomiting consistent
   with acute pancreatitis.
   # Acute pancreatitis: Patient with acute pancreatitis on presentation
   and underwent ERCP on [**1-31**] which revelaed no stones but biliary sludge
   was noted, a sphrincterotomy performed and pancreatic duct stent
   placed. Labs are currently trending down.
   - ADAT
   - Pain control with IV Morphine
   - Zofran PRN nausea
   - cont to trend LFT's
   - cont Zosyn for now
   - F/U blood cultures
   - f/u ERCP recs and will need pancreatic stent removed via ERCP in 1
   week
   # ?GI bleed: Patient had an episode of maroon stool on [**2-1**]. This was
   tought to be due to post-procedure bleeding. ERCP team concluded only
   option is to repeat ERCP to evaluate sphincterotomy but patient and
   family adamantly refused and this would cause re-intubation and they
   would not want this. Hct was 29.8 this am stable from 30.2 yesterday.
   - pm Hct to eval for stability
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse if Hct <28
   - f/u ERCP recs
   # Leukocytosis: Patient presented with (fever and leukocytosis). Her
   WBC has continued to trend down and she has remained afebrile while in
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].
   - trend fevers and WBC
   - Continue antibiotics
   - F/u blood cultures
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient with unclear cardiac history but has a
   pacemaker and is being V-paced. She has been in and out of  atrial
   fibrillation throughout her [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] stay. On tele her PM has been pacing
   at ~75 bpm with intermitten pacing at ~120 bpm. The reason for this is
   unknown.
   - will cont to hold BP meds as pt normotensive on these and with
   possible GI bleed
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - consider consulting EP for PM interrogation
   # COPD: Unknown history of COPD reported in ED records. Does not use O2
   at baseline, but diffusely wheezy on exam.
   - Albuterol & Ipratropium nebs q6H
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Diabetes Mellitus: Patient with history of DM, but per report, not on
   any medications as an outpatient.
   - NPO
   - q6H fingersticks
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Levothyroxine IV 25mcg daily for now
   # Mild dementia: Unknown baseline, patient appears to be doing well.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute onset abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting consistent with acute pancreatitis. She presented with acute pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP, which revealed no stones but biliary sludge was noted. A sphincterotomy was performed and a pancreatic duct stent placed. Labs are currently trending down.

The patient also experienced an episode of maroon stool on [**2-1**], which was thought to be due to post-procedure bleeding.

The patient's Hct was stable at 29.8 this morning, compared to 30.2 yesterday.

Other assessments and plans include leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and mild dementia. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments, including pain control with IV morphine, Zofran for nausea, continuing LFTs, Zosyn for infection, blood cultures, and pancreatic stent removal via ERCP in one week.

Potential medical complications that can arise include GI bleed, re-occurrence of pancreatitis, respiratory issues due to COPD, uncontrolled diabetes, and complications related to the atrial fibrillation. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of acute pancreatitis, who underwent ERCP and had biliary sludge removed. She has been experiencing intermittent pacing at ~120 bpm, possibly due to atrial fibrillation. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is trending down, and a possible GI bleed with maroon stool. She has a history of COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and mild dementia. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient presented with acute pancreatitis and underwent ERCP. There were no stones found, but biliary sludge was noted, and a sphincterotomy was performed along with pancreatic duct stent placement. The labs are currently trending down, indicating improvement.
2. GI Bleed: The patient had an episode of maroon stool, which was thought to be due to post-procedure bleeding. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient presented with fever and leukocytosis. Her WBC count has continued to trend down, and she remains afebrile while in the ICU.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation throughout her ICU stay. She is being V-paced, and the reason for this is unknown.

   [**Age over 90 **] yo female admitted with pancreatitis now with improved control of
   SIRS and recent active issue of concern for possible GI bleed.  We have
   continued improvement in liver associated enzymes.
   1)Pancreatitis-
   -Zosyn to discontinue today in the setting of non-necrotizing
   pancreatitis and minimal evidence of ongoing infection
   -Advance to clear liquids diet today and advance as tolerated
   -IVF appears to be adequate at this time and goal is to maintain U/O at
   30-50cc/d
   -She is s/p stent and sphincterotomy at this time and we have improving
   liver associated enzymes
   -ERCP to advise on timing of stent removal which may require intubation
   2)GI Bleed-_She has had maroon stool x2 over past 24 hours and
   reasoanbly minimal change in HCT over past 24 hours
   -Follow HCT
   -Transfuse for acute drop
   -Peripheral IV access is in place
   -GI to follow for any intervention which at this point is not desired
   by family and it is clinically resonable to continue with monitoring of
   HCT at this time

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3480**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian-speaking female who presented with
   acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, & vomiting consistent
   with acute pancreatitis.
   # Acute pancreatitis: Patient with acute pancreatitis on presentation
   and underwent ERCP on [**1-31**] which revealed no stones but biliary sludge
   was noted, a sphrincterotomy performed and pancreatic duct stent
   placed. Labs are currently trending down. Zosyn was stopped yesterday
   due to lack of fevers and (-) blood cultures.
   - ADAT
   - cont to trend LFT's
   - f/u ERCP recs as will need pancreatic stent removed via ERCP 1 week
   post-placement
   # ?GI bleed: Patient had an episode of maroon stool on [**2-1**]. This was
   tought to be due to post-procedure bleeding. Hct has remained stable at
    ~29.
   - f/u daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - cont PPI
   #AMS: Patient was thought to have mild AMS by her daughter
   (communication with patient is limited due to language barrier). This
   is likely due to delirium in an elderly patient, in the ICU who is
   receiving narcotics for pain control.
   - will dc mophine and ondansetron
   - will obtain a better assessment today with the help of translator
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   # Leukocytosis: Patient presented with (fever and leukocytosis). Her
   WBC has continued to trend down and she has remained afebrile while in
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].
   - trend fevers and WBC
   - stop antibiotics
   - F/u blood cultures
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient with unclear cardiac history but has a
   pacemaker and is being V-paced with intermittent A-pacing. On tele her
   PM has been pacing at ~75 bpm with intermitten pacing at ~120 bpm. The
   reason for this is unknown. PM is a St. [**Male First Name (un) 1104**] Entity.
   - consider re-starting BP meds as pt with stable GI bleed that was
   likely procedure related
   - cont to monitor on tele
   - consider consulting EP for PM interrogation if patient becomes
   symptomatic or unstable
   # COPD: Unknown history of COPD reported in ED records.
   - Albuterol & Ipratropium nebs q6H
   - Wean O2 as tolerates
   # Diabetes Mellitus: Patient with history of DM, but per report, not on
   any medications as an outpatient.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She was admitted to the hospital with pancreatitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The ERCP revealed no stones but biliary sludge was noted, and a sphincterotomy was performed along with the placement of a pancreatic duct stent.

The patient has experienced several medical complications during her stay in the ICU. These include:

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis, including acute onset of abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, and vomiting. She underwent ERCP, which showed biliary sludge and a sphincterotomy was performed. Her labs are currently trending down.

2. GI bleed: The patient had an episode of maroon stool on [**2-1**], which was thought to be due to post-procedure bleeding. The ERCP team recommended repeating the ERCP to evaluate the sphincterotomy, but the patient and family refused. The Hct level was stable at 29.8 this morning, and PPI (proton pump inhibitor) was started.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient presented with fever and leukocytosis. Her WBC count has continued to trend down, and she has remained a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She was admitted to the hospital with pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart Rate: 73 bpm (with intermittent pacing at 120 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 135/65 mmHg (with previous readings ranging from 117/37 to 156/76 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 13 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 95% on nasal cannula

The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, for which she underwent ERCP and had biliary sludge noted. A sphincterotomy was performed, and a pancreatic duct stent was placed. Her labs are currently trending down, and she is no longer febrile or showing any signs of infection.

However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. GI bleed: The patient had an episode of maroon stool on 2/1, which was thought to be due to post-procedure bleeding. Her hematocrit (Hct) level has remained stable at around 29. It is important to continue monitoring her daily Hct, perform guaiac stool tests, follow up with ERCP recommendations, and continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

2. AMS (acute mental status changes): The patient was thought to have mild acute mental status changes by her daughter, likely due to delirium in an elderly patient receiving narcotics for pain control. It is important to discontinue morphine and ondansetron, obtain a better assessment with the help of a translator, and minimize lines and tubes.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient presented with fever and leukocytosis, but her white blood cell (WBC) count has continued to trend down, and she has remained afebrile while in the ICU. It is important to continue monitoring her WBC count and follow up with blood cultures.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an unclear cardiac history but has a pacemaker and is being ventricular-paced with intermittent atrial pacing. The reason for this is unknown, but it could be due to atrioventricular nodal blockade (AVN) or pacemaker malfunction. It is important to obtain a 12-lead EKG and rhythm strip to better characterize the source of rhythm abnormality noted on telemetry, continue monitoring on telemetry, and consider consulting an electrophysiologist for pacemaker interrogation.

5. HTN (hypertension): The patient's blood pressure medications were initially held due to hypotension and a small GI bleed. Currently, she is hypertensive and not bleeding. It is important to restart her home dose medications, continue to monitor her blood pressure, and consider consulting a cardiologist for further management.

6. COPD: The patient has an unknown history of COPD. She should be given albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every 6 hours and weaned off oxygen as tolerated.

7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus but is not currently on any medications. It is important to administer regular insulin sliding scale, monitor her blood glucose levels, and consider starting her on oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin therapy as per her HbA1c levels and fasting blood glucose levels.

8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and levothyroxine IV 25mcg daily should be administered for now. It is important to monitor her thyroid function tests regularly and adjust the dosage accordingly.

In summary, the patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, GI bleed, AMS, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, HTN, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. The potential medical complications that can arise include GI bleed, AMS, leukocytosis, atrial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of pancreatitis who underwent an ERCP and sphincterotomy. She is currently experiencing persistent gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/53 to 156/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH of 7.30.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is overweight/obese with distant heart sounds and diminished breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination was not fully assessed.

The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is an elevated amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatitis. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of pancreatitis, GI bleeding, and altered mental status. The patient's pain is well-controlled, and she is advancing to a regular oral diet. She will require a future ERCP to remove the stent. The GI bleed is being monitored with daily HCT measurements"
