   Assessment and Plan
   Hypoxemia:  Likely multifactorial due to continued fluid overload with
   underlying lung injury due to ARDS.   Fever may also be contributing by
   increasing metabolic load.  Continue to
   diurese as she currently weighs 54kg and dry weight is 103lbs.
   Fevers:  increased WBC, however has been on meropenem and vanco with no
   improvement.  Would be inclined to stop antibiotics for now and check
   for C. diff.
   Elevated lipase/amylase.  no clear explanation, no abdominal
   discomfort, doubt pancreatitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement on arrival to MICU. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. Differential includes significant
   deconditioning and increased activity over the last 48 hours,
   persistent and resolving ARDS picture, development of a new pneumonia
   over her pre-existing resolving ARDS, PE given her prolonged hospital
   course (although she has been on DVT prophylaxis), and congestive heart
   failure (although she has remained negative for the last 48-72 hours).
   Plan is the following:
   - continue face mask for now and wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - will discontinue antibiotics for now and restart meropenem and
   vancomycin if patient decompensates
   - Chest PT
   .
   2. Depression
   -Continue Geodon, Prozac
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   - Husband hinting at possible anorexia history-SW consult, and
   Nutrition for calorie counts
   .
   3. Fever and Leukocytosis
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Blood cultures
   pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - follow-up cultures
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional enzymes, will start empiric vanc
   today for possible C diff infection
   - hold off antibiotics for now and restart pending further culture data
   - Amylase/lipase for today
   - UA

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia who presents to the MICU for increased O2 requirement. The patient has been stable on 4-5L NC but now requires more oxygen, with an unclear etiology. Differential diagnoses include deconditioning, persistent or resolving ARDS, development of new pneumonia, PE given her prolonged hospital course, and congestive heart failure. The patient's recent events include being transferred to the MICU for tachypnea and hypoxia, completion of a meropenem course with unclear treatment, possible drug fever, and difficulty with ileostomy overnight. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.4, blood pressure ranging from 104/56 to 113/77 mmHg, heart rate between 81-110 bpm, respiratory rate between 22-51 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 83%. The patient is pleasant and in mild respiratory distress with increased work of breathing. Physical examination findings include coarse breath sounds with occasional wheezes, trace lower extremity edema, and intact neurologic function. Lab results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and normal glucose levels. The patient has completed treatment for H. flu bacteremia and has ongoing plans for weaning O2, diuresis, bronchodilator treatment, and monitoring for potential complications such as pneumonia, PE, and CHF."

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement over the last 24 hours. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. Differential includes significant
   deconditioning and increased activity over the last 48 hours,
   persistent and resolving ARDS picture, development of a new pneumonia
   over her pre-existing resolving ARDS, PE given her prolonged hospital
   course (although she has been on DVT prophylaxis), and congestive heart
   failure (although she has remained negative for the last 48-72 hours).
   Plan is the following:
   - continue face mask for now and wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - will discontinue antibiotics for now and restart meropenem and
   vancomycin if patient decompensates
   .
   2. Depression
   -Continue Geodon, Prozac
   - consider restarting ritalin
   .
   3. Fever and Leukocytosis
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Blood cultures
   pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - follow-up cultures
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional enzymes
   - hold off antibiotics for now and restart pending further culture data

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS and H. flu bacteremia who presents to the MICU for increased oxygen requirement. She has been stable on 4-5L NC but is now experiencing hypoxia, with unclear etiology. The differential includes deconditioning, persistent/resolving ARDS, new pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The plan includes continuing face mask O2, diuresis, albuterol and ipratropium treatments, and discontinuing antibiotics for now while restarting meropenem and vancomycin if the patient decompensates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's increased oxygen requirement may be due to several factors such as deconditioning, persistent/resolving ARDS, new pneumonia, PE, or CHF. Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and adjusting the oxygen flow rate accordingly is crucial to prevent further respiratory distress.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has an unclear etiology for fever and leukocytosis. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and it is important to follow-up with these results. If the patient's condition worsens, restarting antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance should be closely monitored due to potential imbalances that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of H flu PNA and ARDS who returned from the floor with increasing hypoxemia. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress and requires a significant amount of oxygen. The patient is also fluid overloaded, as indicated by her examination, so she will continue to be diuresed with Lasix. The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests treating empirically for C. diff with Flagyl. Despite multiple courses of antibiotics, there has been no improvement in her condition. The patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress and ARDS, there is a risk of respiratory failure if her condition worsens or if she is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient appears to be fluid overloaded based on her examination findings. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiac dysfunction, and renal impairment.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis raise concerns about a potential infection. Without proper treatment, this could progress to sepsis or develop into a more severe infection like C. diff colitis.
4. Thromboembolic Events: As an immobilized patient in the ICU, she is at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophyl"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement on arrival to MICU. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. Differential includes significant
   deconditioning and increased activity over the last 48 hours,
   persistent and resolving ARDS picture, development of a new pneumonia
   over her pre-existing resolving ARDS, PE given her prolonged hospital
   course (although she has been on DVT prophylaxis), and congestive heart
   failure (although she has remained negative for the last 48-72 hours).
   Plan is the following:
   - continue face mask for now and wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - Chest PT
   .
   2. Fever and Leukocytosis
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Possible
   empyema, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis given elevated LFTs.  Blood
   cultures pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - follow-up cultures
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional tests
   - f/u RUQ U/S
   - thoracentesis today
   - hold off antibiotics for now until thoracentesis and then consider
   broad-spectrum ABX
   - ID rec
d pulling PICC and foley
   .
   3. Depression
   -Continue Geodon, Prozac
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   - Husband hinting at possible anorexia history-SW consult, and
   Nutrition for calorie counts

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement on arrival to MICU. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. Differential includes significant
   deconditioning and increased activity over the last 48 hours,
   persistent and resolving ARDS picture, development of a new pneumonia
   over her pre-existing resolving ARDS, PE given her prolonged hospital
   course (although she has been on DVT prophylaxis), and congestive heart
   failure (although she has remained negative for the last 48-72 hours).
   Plan is the following:
   - continue face mask for now and wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - will discontinue antibiotics for now and restart meropenem and
   vancomycin if patient decompensates
   - Chest PT
   .
   2. Depression
   -Continue Geodon, Prozac
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   - Husband hinting at possible anorexia history-SW consult, and
   Nutrition for calorie counts
   .
   3. Fever and Leukocytosis
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Blood cultures
   pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - follow-up cultures
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional enzymes, will start empiric vanc
   today for possible C diff infection
   - hold off antibiotics for now and restart pending further culture data
   - Amylase/lipase for today
   - UA

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for increased oxygen requirement. She has a history of resolving ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia. Upon admission, the patient had an increase in her oxygen requirement, and the etiology of this increase is unclear. The differential diagnosis includes deconditioning, persistent and resolving ARDS picture, development of a new pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow neb.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress with increased work of breathing, coarse breath sounds throughout with occasional wheezes, trace lower extremity edema, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's current plan includes continuing face mask oxygen, weaning as tolerated, diuresis with goal input/output balance of 500cc-1L negative with prn Lasix doses, and continuing al"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, and pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, antitussives, Flagyl for C diff coverage, and diuretics. The patient also has a history of allergies to clindamycin and is on several medications such as furosemide.

The vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The fluid balance shows an intake-output balance with more output than intake, indicating potential fluid loss.

The lab results indicate leukocytosis with a high white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels except for slightly low potassium and magnesium. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been monitored for respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The ABG results are not provided in the note, but the oxygen saturation is maintained at 97%.

The physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient's unresponsive state, making it difficult to assess peripheral pulses, skin condition, and neurologic status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and delirium due to impaired cognition and arousal"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement on arrival to MICU. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. Differential includes significant
   deconditioning and increased activity over the last 48 hours,
   persistent and resolving ARDS picture, development of a new pneumonia
   over her pre-existing resolving ARDS, PE given her prolonged hospital
   course (although she has been on DVT prophylaxis), and congestive heart
   failure (although she has remained negative for the last 48-72 hours).
   Plan is the following:
   - continue face mask for now and wean O2 as tolerated
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - Chest PT
   .
   2. Fever and Leukocytosis
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Possible
   empyema, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis given elevated LFTs.  Blood
   cultures pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - follow-up cultures
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional tests
   - f/u RUQ U/S
   - f/u LENIs
   - thoracentesis today
   - hold off antibiotics for now until thoracentesis and then consider
   broad-spectrum ABX
   - ID rec
d pulling PICC and foley
   .
   3. Depression
   -Continue Geodon, Prozac
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   - Husband hinting at possible anorexia history-SW consult, and
   Nutrition for calorie counts

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and impaired cognitive function. She has a history of altered mental status, fever, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs indicate tachypnea, low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate. Her oxygen saturation is within normal range, but she is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. Physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, occasional wheezing, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated BUN, and decreased sodium levels. Imaging shows no evidence of cholecystitis or significant abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung dysfunction and potentially fatal respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status raise concerns for sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment are crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, respiratory distress, and potential bacterial findings on blood culture suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (low sodium levels). Close monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia, presenting for re-admission to the MICU due to increased O2 requirement. She has been stable on 4-5L NC but now requires more oxygen. The etiology of her increased O2 requirement is unclear, but persistent ARDS with slow recovery is likely. She continues to receive face mask oxygen, diuretics, albuterol, ipratropium treatments, and cepacol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's increased O2 requirement may indicate ongoing respiratory distress or a relapse of ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory function is necessary to adjust oxygen therapy accordingly.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count could suggest an ongoing infection, such as empyema or cholangitis. Blood and urine cultures are pending to identify the causative organism. The patient is being treated empirically for C. difficile infection while awaiting test results.
3. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently being treated with Geodon and Prozac. The husband hints at possible anorexia, so a social work consultation and nutrition evaluation are recommended to assess nutritional status and provide appropriate interventions.
4. Potential electrolyte imbalances: The patient's labs show low potassium (K+), low bicarbonate (HCO3-"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement on arrival to MICU. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 4420**] likely is persistent ARDS with slow
   recovery
   - still requiring 60% face mask with desats upon movement.  RR
   increased to 40s this morning.  Did trial of bipap but patient did not
   tolerate it well secondary to anxiety.
   - will try to control anxiety  better today to see if RR decreases.
   Extra dose of ativan given, now trying a small 0.5 mg dose of morphine
   to see if anxiety is helped.  Will continue to monitor.  Will try to
   avoid intubation if possible.  If intubation is needed, would likely
   have tracheostomy placed quickly.
   - with fever and stable leukocytosis, most likely place of infection is
   lungs
 pna or emphysema.  Could have other source as well.  Today will
   do CT sinuses, CT chest/abd/pelvis for fever workup.
   - also rule out PE with CTA
   - sending beta glucan and galactomannan
   - starting impiric HAP treatment with vanco/zosyn, ID following.
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - Chest PT
   .
   2. Fever and Leukocytosis
 stable WBC, now with fever overnight.
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Possible
   empyema, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis given elevated LFTs.  Blood
   cultures pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - CT scans as above
   - starting vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - thoracentesis if large fluid collection can be reached after CT scan
   completed
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional tests, continuing impiric treatment
   with 14 d course of Flagyl,
   - RUQ neg for cholecystitis
   - LENIs negative
   - PICC removed, foley changed
   .
   3. Depression
   - seems to have worsening anxiety, will discuss with her psychiatrist
   any possible med changes
   - increasing prozac dose to 80 mg daily (up from 40 mg daily)
   -Continue Geodon
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   - Husband hinting at possible anorexia history-SW consult, and
   Nutrition for calorie counts, nutrition thinks she has adequate calorie
   intake for now.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4Â°C (101.2Â°F), blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has been diagnosed with hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, depression, and potential complications such as empyema or cholecystitis/cholangitis. The patient is receiving various treatments including diuretics, bronchodilators, antibiotics, and psychiatric medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's increased oxygen requirement indicates respiratory distress or inadequate gas exchange. This may be due to persistent ARDS or another underlying lung condition. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of oxygen therapy are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection or inflammation. Further investigations, such as blood and urine cultures, are needed to identify the source of infection. Possible causes include empyema (pus accumulation in the lungs), cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), or cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Empyema"

","The patient is a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and zosyn. The patient also has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and is on Flagyl for it.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.6 C (101.4 F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 97/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 50%.

The patient has pleural effusions, and a thoracentesis was performed, draining 1L of yellow fluid which was determined to be exudative. The patient's chest X-ray shows clear sinuses but large pleural effusions. A CT scan of the sinuses, chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed no pulmonary embolism.

The patient has a history of allergies to clindamycin, facial swelling after the last dose of antibiotics (metronidazole), and recent administration of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   1. Hypoxia
   Patient had been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in her O2
   requirement on arrival to MICU. Etiology of her increased O2
   requirement is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 4420**] likely is persistent ARDS with slow
   recovery
   - still requiring 60% face mask with desats upon movement.  RR
   increased to 40s this morning.  Did trial of bipap but patient did not
   tolerate it well secondary to anxiety.
   - will try to control anxiety  better today to see if RR decreases.
   Extra dose of ativan given, now trying a small 0.5 mg dose of morphine
   to see if anxiety is helped.  Will continue to monitor.  Will try to
   avoid intubation if possible.  If intubation is needed, would likely
   have tracheostomy placed quickly.
   - with fever and stable leukocytosis, most likely place of infection is
   lungs
 pna or emphysema.  Could have other source as well.  Today will
   do CT sinuses, CT chest/abd/pelvis for fever workup.
   - also rule out PE with CTA
   - sending beta glucan and galactomannan
   - starting impiric HAP treatment with vanco/zosyn, ID following.
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium treatments
   - continue cepacol
   - patient has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia
   with azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem and no clear
   source
   - Chest PT
   .
   2. Fever and Leukocytosis
 stable WBC, now with fever overnight.
   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Possible
   empyema, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis given elevated LFTs.  Blood
   cultures pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - CT scans as above
   - starting vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - thoracentesis if large fluid collection can be reached after CT scan
   completed
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional tests, continuing impiric treatment
   with 14 d course of Flagyl,
   - RUQ neg for cholecystitis
   - LENIs negative
   - PICC removed, foley changed
   .
   3. Depression
   - seems to have worsening anxiety, will discuss with her psychiatrist
   any possible med changes
   - increasing prozac dose to 80 mg daily (up from 40 mg daily)
   -Continue Geodon
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   - Husband hinting at possible anorexia history-SW consult, and
   Nutrition for calorie counts, nutrition thinks she has adequate calorie
   intake for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU for increased O2 requirement. The patient is currently on 60% face mask oxygen and has desats upon movement. Her respiratory rate has increased to the 40s. Bipap was attempted but not tolerated well due to anxiety. The patient is being given extra doses of ativan and a small dose of morphine to control anxiety. Fever and leukocytosis are present, with a possible source of infection in the lungs, such as pneumonia or emphysema. CT scans of the sinuses, chest/abd/pelvis will be done to evaluate for fever workup. A CT angiogram will also be performed to rule out pulmonary embolism. Beta glucan and galactomannan tests are being sent, and imipenem/cilastatin therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) will be started. Diuretics will continue with the goal of maintaining I/Os between 500cc-1L negative, using prn lasix doses as needed. Albuterol and ipratropium treatments will continue, as well as cefepime. The patient has completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. Chest PT will be done.

1. Hypoxia: The patient's increased O2 requirement and RR in the 40s indicate a potential respiratory compromise. This could be due to persistent ARDS or other lung-related issues such as pneumonia or emphysema.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests an underlying infection. Possible sources include empyema, cholecystitis/cholangitis, or another unidentified source. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and CT scans will be performed to further investigate the cause.
3. Anxiety and Depression: The patient's worsening anxiety and depression will be addressed by increasing the dose of Prozac and discussing potential medication changes with the psychiatrist. Consideration will also be given to restarting Ritalin.
4. Potential Anorexia: The patient's husband mentioned a possible history of anorexia, and a social work consultation has been scheduled to assess this further. Nutrition will monitor the patient's calorie intake.
5. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance needs close monitoring, with the goal of maintaining I/Os between 500cc-1L negative. Prn lasix doses will be administered as needed to achieve this balance.
6. Potential Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk for developing HAP due to her prolonged hospital stay. Imipenem/cilastatin therapy has been initiated to prevent and treat HAP."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, rash, and respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn), Flagyl for c.diff, and an increased dose of Prozac for anxiety. The patient underwent a CT scan of the sinuses, chest/abdomen/pelvis, which showed clear sinuses but large pleural effusions. Thoracentesis was performed, draining 1L of yellow fluid that was exudative in nature. The patient was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 400, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 50, and RR of 16. The patient has experienced episodes of hypoxia and has not tolerated weaning off FiO2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 97/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 45 mL. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 15.7 to 34.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient has been on prophylactic heparin sodium and pantop"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for increased oxygen requirements. The patient's condition has worsened, and she is now requiring more ventilator support and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's ARDS has acutely worsened, indicating a potential complication of respiratory failure. She is requiring more ventilator support and sedation to manage her oxygen requirements.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has developed a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
3. Depression: The patient is experiencing worsening anxiety and depression. Medication adjustments are being considered to help manage her psychiatric symptoms.

Overall, the patient is facing respiratory distress with worsening ARDS, an elevated risk of infection indicated by fever and leukocytosis, and psychological distress requiring psychiatric intervention."

   Unclear etiology for patient's fever and leukocytosis. Possible
   empyema, possible cholecystitis/cholangitis given elevated LFTs.  Blood
   cultures pending, urine cultures pending, Cdiff negative x 1.
   - CT scans as above
   - starting vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - thoracentesis if large fluid collection can be reached after CT scan
   completed
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - rule-out Cdiff with 2 additional tests, continuing impiric treatment
   with 14 d course of Flagyl,
   - RUQ neg for cholecystitis
   - LENIs negative
   - PICC removed, foley changed
   .
   3. Depression
   - seems to have worsening anxiety, will discuss with her psychiatrist

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, indicating respiratory distress. This could be due to acute worsening of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has already been started on vancomycin and zosyn for HAP.

2. Respiratory anxiety: The patient is overbreathing on the ventilator, which suggests anxiety related to her respiratory condition. Sedation may need to be titrated up to manage this issue.

3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has developed a fever and elevated white blood cell count overnight. This could indicate an infection, such as empyema (pus in the pleural space) or cholecystitis/cholangitis (inflammation of the gallbladder or bile ducts). Blood and urine cultures are pending, and further investigations are needed to determine the cause.

4. Depression and anxiety: The patient's psychiatric history includes OCD and depression. Her worsening anxiety will be discussed with the psychiatrist, and medication adjustments may be necessary.

5. Pleural effusions: The patient has large pleural effusions, which have been drained through thoracentesis. These effusions are exudative in nature, indicating an inflammatory process.

6. Cholecystitis/cholangitis: The patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) suggest"

She presents for re-admission to the MICU due to increased O2 requirement. The patient's condition has acutely worsened, requiring more ventilator support and sedation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing increased O2 requirement, worsening ARDS, and hypoxia. These symptoms suggest a respiratory distress situation that requires close monitoring and intervention.

2. Infection: The patient has completed treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and an empiric course of meropenem. Additionally, the patient's WBC count is rising, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and other tests are pending to identify the source of infection.

3. Pleural effusions: The CT scan shows large pleural effusions. Thoracentesis was performed, draining 1L of yellow fluid which was exudative and contained many polys. The fluid analysis suggests a possible infectious or inflammatory process.

4. Anxiety and depression: The patient is showing signs of worsening anxiety and depression. Appropriate psychiatric support and medication adjustments should be considered to address these mental health issues.

5. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is concerning with a negative balance of -1552 mL. This indicates that more fluid is being removed"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy, thoracentesis, trans-thoracic echo, and arterial line insertion.
- The patient had an initial event where 500cc of fluid was removed, which was not an empyema but showed borderline exudate by LDH, with lots of poly, Gram stain none. This indicated a potential infection.
- The patient was confirmed to have VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and switched antibiotics from vancomycin to linezolid, with consultation from the ID (infectious disease) team.
- The patient stopped receiving cdiff (Clostridium difficile) treatment, discontinuing flagyl.
- A cardiac echo revealed no vegetations, but there was worsening pulmonary hypertension as expected.
- The patient started receiving tube feeds.
- The patient has allergies to clindamycin, which caused facial swelling.
- The patient received various medications, including metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, linezolid, and meropenem. The last doses were given on 12/25/2178.
- The patient is currently on vecuronium, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission,"

   chest/abd/pelvis - clear sinuses, large pleural effusions, no PE.
   - tracheostomy placed this morning
   - beta glucan and galactomannan pending
   - to do left [**Female First Name (un) **] today
   - treated with vanc zosyn for two days and today spoke to ID and
   switched zosyn to meropenem. Would like to switch vanc to linezolid but
   not doing so because of concern for serotonin syndrome and VRE not
   confirmed.
   - continue diuresis with goal I/Os 500cc-1L negative with prn lasix
   doses-patient responds well to 20 mg boluses

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU due to an increased O2 requirement and worsening respiratory status.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, fever, and leukocytosis. She is on mechanical ventilation support and sedation. The patient has completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. A pleural effusion was drained, and cultures are pending.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are still present, with elevated liver function tests. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and a full skin exam, as well as an echo evaluation for endocarditis, will be done. Thoracentesis may be performed if a large fluid collection can be reached after a CT scan.

The patient also has a history of depression and is being treated with various medications. Her nutrition intake is being monitored, and she is receiving enteral feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's worsening respiratory status and increased O2 requirement indicate ongoing respiratory distress, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Infection: Despite completing treatment for H. flu bacteremia, the patient still has fever and leukocytosis. There is a possibility of a new infection, and cultures are pending.
3. Organ dysfunction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She underwent percutaneous tracheostomy, thoracentesis, trans-thoracic echo, and arterial line placement. The patient has a history of anxiety, fever of unknown origin, rash, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired knowledge, electrolyte/fluid disorder, constipation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, pneumonia, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially develop into a more severe infection.
2. ARDS: The patient already has ARDS, a life-threatening condition that affects the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. This condition can progress and cause further respiratory compromise.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including low potassium (K+), low magnesium (Mg++), and low calcium (Ca++). These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and may require correction to prevent complications.
4. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to immobility, sedation, and medication use. This can lead to discomfort and potential complications such as fecal impaction.
5. Infection: The patient's history of fever and presence of"

   During rounds, we reduced PSV to 5 and PEEP to 5. There was no change
   in minute ventilation, VT, or respiratory rate. Patient did not
   complain of any change in shortness of breath. I suspect patient has
   increased ventilation from stimulation of pulmonary receptors, possibly
   pulmonary fibrosis, and increased dead space (PaCO2 45 despite high
   minute ventilation, yet she also has an alkalemia). She may be able to
   sustain this ventilation on her own; if she tolerates PSV 5/5, would
   consider a trial on trach mask for a few hours later today. She looks
   nutritionally depleted and may require some time to build up strength
   and endurance of her ventilatory muscles to sustain herself off of the
   ventilator long term.
   Continues on antibiotics for presumed pneumonia and new VRE urinary
   tract infection.
   Hct down from 26 to 23, perhaps related to fluids. Not yet at
   transfusion threshold. Monitor stool guaiac.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a VRE urinary tract infection. The patient has undergone several procedures, including thoracentesis, percutaneous tracheostomy, trans thoracic echo, and arterial line insertion.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 100.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 80/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.43, PaCO2 48 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, mild respiratory distress, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.4 thousand cells/microliter, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 119 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level at 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes anxiety, fever"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS and H. flu bacteremia who was admitted to the MICU for increased oxygen requirement. She presented with acute worsening overnight and now requires more ventilator support and sedation. The patient had previously been stable on 4-5L NC but experienced an increase in O2 requirement on arrival to MICU. ARDS worsened yesterday, indicating possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient completed treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. A CT scan of the sinuses, chest/abdomen/pelvis showed clear sinuses, large pleural effusions, and no pulmonary embolism. The patient has a tracheostomy in place, on pressure support ventilation (PSV), weaning settings. She has high minute ventilation due to increased dead space.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's ARDS has acutely worsened, leading to increased oxygen requirement. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory distress.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient is experiencing a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient is at risk of metabolic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. The patient has been experiencing a continuous spike in temperature, indicating a possible fever of unknown origin. They are also hyperventilating and have been given additional doses of lorazepam (Ativan) to help with sleep and anxiety.

The patient underwent a tracheostomy mask trial but became slightly hypoxic and was placed back on mechanical ventilation. There are worsening opacities seen on the chest X-ray, suggesting a possible respiratory infection or pneumonia.

The patient has a history of allergies to clindamycin, resulting in facial swelling. They have received multiple antibiotics including metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, linezolid, and meropenem.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium (Prophylaxis). They are also on other medications such as lorazepam (Ativan) and have been given a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a low hemoglobin level.

The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (tachycardia), low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and a temperature within normal range. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia who presents for re-admission to the MICU due to increased O2 requirement. She has acute worsening overnight and requires more ventilator support and sedation. The patient has completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. She has a tracheostomy in place and is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with weaning settings. The patient has high minute ventilation due to increased dead space.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient had previously been stable on 4-5L NC and had an increase in O2 requirement on arrival to MICU, but ARDS acutely worsened yesterday, concerning for HAP. She was started on vanc/zosyn and has now completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and meropenem.

2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has a rising WBC count and fever overnight. The etiology for her fever and leukocytosis is unclear, especially with elevated LFTs. Blood cultures are negative, and cardiac echo shows no evidence of endocarditis. No evidence of empyemas on chest CT scan, and pan-scan negative. Flagyl was stopped for cdiff as it was not consistent with lab or clinical findings."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU for increased O2 requirement and worsening respiratory status. The patient had completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and an empiric course of meropenem. She has tracheostomy in place, on pressure support ventilation (PSV), weaning settings, and high minute ventilation due to increased dead space. She continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety. The patient's fever and leukocytosis are still unclear, with elevated LFTs. Blood cultures are pending, and cardiac echo shows no evidence of endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's ARDS has acutely worsened, and she is now requiring more ventilatory support.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and rising WBC count indicate a possible infection or inflammatory response.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has no vomiting, but there is a need to reduce potassium levels.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is within the range of 23-27 and will be transfused for less than 21.
5. Depression: The patient seems to have worsening anxiety and may benefit from in-house psych consultation.
6. Rash: The patient has a pap"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU for increased O2 requirement and is now requiring more ventilatory support and sedation. The patient had previously been stable on 4-5L NC but experienced an acute worsening of ARDS and increased O2 requirement. She is being treated with vanc/zosyn, and completed treatment for her known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. The patient has tracheostomy in place, on PSV weaning settings, and high minute ventilation due to increased dead space. The plan includes trying tracheostomy mask trials, continuing diuresis, concentrating fluid intake, and beta-glucan negative. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is being monitored for serotonin syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's acute worsening of ARDS and increased O2 requirement indicate a potential complication of respiratory distress.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's rising WBC count and fever suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. The elevated liver enzymes (LFTs) further indicate possible hepatic involvement.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is high, indicating a potential complication of metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to respiratory causes or diuretic use.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is within the range of 23-27, indicating mild anemia. Transfusion may be necessary for patients with hemoglobin less than 21.
5. Depression: The patient is experiencing worsening anxiety and depression, which can be complications associated with chronic illness and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Rash: The patient has a papular rash and occasional pustules on the lower back and buttocks. This could be contact dermatitis or a fungal infection.

The potential medical complications include respiratory distress, ongoing infection or inflammatory response, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, depression, and rash."

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement. Patient acutely
   worsened overnight and is now requiring more vent support and sedation.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypnic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind.

   consistent with lab or clinical findings. Derm bx was consistent with
   fungal infection and their recs were to give a week off Fluconazole.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement. Patient acutely
   worsened overnight and is now requiring more vent support and sedation.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypnic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   BOOP would require treatment with steroids and until clear diagnosis
   Patient appears to be heading down a path towards VATS, decortication,
   and wedge bx

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia. She presents to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for increased O2 requirement. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including azithromycin, meropenem, vancomycin, and linezolid. She also underwent bilateral pleural decortication and tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes fever and leukocytosis with an unclear etiology. Blood cultures are negative, and cardiac echo shows no evidence of endocarditis. Empyemas were ruled out through bronchoscopy, and the patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored. The patient is also experiencing anemia, depression, and a papular rash with occasional pustules on her lower back and buttocks.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, infection due to persistent leukocytosis and fever, progression of ARDS, development of nosocomial pneumonia, and possible steroid dependency if diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The patient's nutritional status and glycemic control are being closely monitored.

Overall, the patient's condition requires careful management and monitoring in the ICU to address the ongoing respiratory issues, potential infections, and other comorbidities."

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged woman who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. She has been experiencing fever and a rash consistent with cutaneous candidiasis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is tachypneic and showing signs of increased work of breathing. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels. She has multiple comorbidities including anxiety, muscle performance impairment, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired knowledge, electrolyte & fluid disorder, constipation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, pneumonia, and unknown origin fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever and respiratory distress, along with the presence of pneumonia in her problem list, indicate a potential risk of developing pneumonia.
2. ARDS: The patient's condition of acute respiratory distress syndrome puts her at risk for further respiratory complications and potential progression of ARDS.
3. Cutaneous candidiasis: The patient's rash and diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis indicate a fungal infection, which requires prompt treatment to prevent complications such as spreading infection or systemic involvement.
4. Impaired gas exchange: The patient's impaired respiration and gas exchange may lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-inch tall individual with unknown weight and age, currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of allergies to clindamycin and are on multiple medications, including furosemide, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for a recent diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis, for which ecenazole cream or fluconazole 200 mg daily for 7 days was prescribed. The patient also has impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, as well as impaired muscle performance and respiration/gas exchange. There are other noted problems, including electrolyte & fluid disorder, constipation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, pneumonia, and unknown origin fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition: This could indicate a neurological issue or the effects of medication. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status regularly and adjust medications if necessary.
2. Impaired muscle performance: This may be due to the patient's critical condition or medication side effects. Regular physical therapy and monitoring for muscle weakness are recommended.
3. Impaired respiration/gas exchange: Given the patient's ARDS, this is a significant concern. Close monitoring of respiratory function and support with mechanical ventilation if needed are essential.
4. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels such as sodium, potassium, chloride"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient
s clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind.
   - IP did not feel thoracentesis would be beneficial
   - will check trigs and lactate from propofol sedation
   - will continue to diurese, on lasix drip, concentrating tube feeds and
   fluids
   - will continue to try short trials of CPAP/PSV
   - speech trial and eval by S&S today
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes T tonight.
   - ID following
   - no peripheral eosinophillia or bronchial fluid eosinophillia
   - ID recs to continue linezolid, day of [**3-25**]
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with resolving ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia.
- She presents for re-admission to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) due to increased O2 requirement.
- The patient has completed treatment for H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem.
- She underwent bilateral thoracentesis for concern of empyema and tracheostomy on [**12-25**].
- The patient continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
- Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl.
- Multiple bronchs have been done, and there does not appear to be a current PNA (Pulmonary Nosocomial Infection).
- The patient's peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia) over typical ARDS picture.
- There has been a poor response to antibiotics and no secretions on bronch argue against PNA.
- The patient's clinical respiratory pattern is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind.
- The patient's fever and leukocytosis have an unclear etiology"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient
s clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind.
   - IP did not feel thoracentesis would be beneficial
   - will check trigs and lactate from propofol sedation
   - will continue to diurese, on lasix drip, concentrating tube feeds and
   fluids
   - beta glucan negative
   - continue cepacol
   - chest PT, patient able to tolerate
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.
   - ID following
   - no peripheral eosinophillia or bronchial fluid eosinophillia
   - ID recs to continue linezolid, day of [**3-25**]
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - RUQ neg for cholecystitis
   - LENIs negative
   - changed foley multiple times
   - cxs NTD
   .
   # met alkalosis
 no vomiting
   -          will give K to attempt to reduce.
   -          giving diamox
   .
   #  Anemia
 in range from 23-27
   - will transfuse for less than 21
   .
   # Depression
   - seems to have worsening anxiety, will obtain in-house psych c/s
   - giving ativan as well
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   -Continue Geodon
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   .
   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient
s clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind.
   - IP did not feel thoracentesis would be beneficial
   - will check trigs and lactate from propofol sedation
   - will continue to diurese, on lasix drip, concentrating tube feeds and
   fluids
   - beta glucan negative
   - continue cepacol
   - chest PT, patient able to tolerate
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.
   - ID following
   - no peripheral eosinophillia or bronchial fluid eosinophillia
   - ID recs to continue linezolid, day of [**3-25**]
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - RUQ neg for cholecystitis
   - LENIs negative
   - changed foley multiple times
   - cxs NTD
   .
   # met alkalosis
 no vomiting
   -          will give K to attempt to reduce.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia. She has been admitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for increased oxygen requirement. The patient underwent bilateral thoracentesis, tracheostomy, and has had multiple bronchoscopies. She has completed a course of treatment for H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. The patient's condition has not improved, and she continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety. There is concern for an infectious cause vs. BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia) as the differential diagnosis for her ARDS. The patient's peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP over the typical ARDS picture. Differentiation of the etiologies of ARDS would require tissue biopsy, which would require VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) but the patient does not have enough lung reserve to undergo this procedure. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of H. flu bacteremia and continues to have fever and leukocytosis. Blood cultures are negative, and there is no obvious source of infection. However, the patient's immune system may be compromised, increasing the risk of further infections.

2. ARDS: The patient's condition is consistent with ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The lack of improvement despite treatment raises concerns about the progression of ARDS.

3. BOOP: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings may suggest BOOP, which is an inflammatory lung condition. BOOP can cause similar symptoms as ARDS and may require treatment with steroids. However, an accurate diagnosis would require a tissue biopsy.

4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has anemia and requires transfusion. There is also concern for metabolic alkalosis and the need for potassium supplementation. These conditions indicate potential organ dysfunction and the need for careful monitoring and management.

5. Psychological Issues: The patient is experiencing worsening anxiety and depression. It is important to address these psychological issues to improve the patient's overall well-being and quality of life.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and appropriate management. The differential diagnosis for ARDS and the presence of fever and leukocytosis indicate the need for further investigation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement, afebrile for
   past three days.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient
s clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind. Patient got PSV valve placed on [**12-30**], resp
   status improving. Dead space 82% from 84%.
   - IP did not feel thoracentesis would be beneficial
   - stopped diuresis
   - will continue to try short trials of CPAP/PSV
   - speech trial and eval by S&S today
   - will discuss pHTN treatment
   - will continue to try to increase amount of time on PSV
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes T tonight.
   - ID following, rechecking c diff
   - no peripheral eosinophillia or bronchial fluid eosinophillia
   - ID recs to continue linezolid, day of [**3-25**]
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - urine grew yeast and wound [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans
   .
   # met alkalosis
 no vomiting
   -          will give K to attempt to reduce.
   -          .
   #  Anemia
 in range from 23-27
   - will transfuse for less than 21

   # Depression
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4588**] to see today (outpt psych)
   - seems to have worsening anxiety, will obtain in-house psych c/s
   - giving ativan as well
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   -Continue Geodon
   - consider restarting Ritalin
   .
   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks
 location, symptoms do not appear c/w drug reaction.  Likely
   contact dermatitis or fungal infection.
   - c/w cutaneous candidiasis -> tx with fluconazole for 1 wk
   # dispo
 not ready for rehab at this time, still doing workup, want to
   see improvement in white count and determine source of infection or
   give steroid trial
   FEN: getting tube feeds, replete lytes PRN
   - nutrition does not want to increase feeds until CO2 increase can be
   sure

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU for increased oxygen requirement and is afebrile for the past three days. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for her infection, including azithromycin, meropenem, and vancomycin/zoledronate. She underwent bilateral thoracentesis on [**Female First Name (un)**] for concern of empyema and tracheostomy on [**12-25**]. The patient continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety. Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple bronchs have been done, and there are no signs of pneumonia. The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and pulmonary fibrosis. The patient's clinical respiratory pattern is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. A Passy-Muir Valve (PMV) was placed on [**12-30**], and the patient's respiratory status has improved. The patient's dead space has decreased from 84% to 82%. The patient's WBC count is stable, but the etiology of her fever and leukocytosis is unclear. Blood cultures are negative, and no infectious organism was identified in the bilateral thoracentesis. A dermatology consultation revealed"

The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, shortness of breath, and cough. The patient has been tolerating Passy-Muir Valve (PMV) on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. A formal bedside swallow evaluation will be done when the patient can tolerate longer trials of PMV. The patient has allergies to clindamycin, which caused face swelling in the past. The patient received linezolid and meropenem antibiotics on [2178-12-28] and [2178-12-29], respectively.

Infusions include furosemide at 4 mg/hour and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include unspecified ICU medications and changes to medical and family history.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 130/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are provided.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate levels. Electrolyte imbalances are noted, with elevated sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. Other lab abnormalities include elevated BUN, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes.

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient
s clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind.
   - IP did not feel thoracentesis would be beneficial
   - will check trigs and lactate from propofol sedation
   - will continue to diurese, on lasix drip, concentrating tube feeds and
   fluids
   - will continue to try short trials of CPAP/PSV
   - speech trial and eval by S&S today

   # Fever and Leukocytosis
WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes T tonight.
   - ID following
   - no peripheral eosinophillia or bronchial fluid eosinophillia
   - ID recs to continue linezolid, day of [**3-25**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS and H. flu bacteremia, who is currently admitted to the MICU for increased O2 requirement. She has been treated with azithromycin, meropenem, and vancomycin-zosyn for her infections. She underwent bilateral thoracentesis, tracheostomy, and had a positive fungal infection on derm bx. Her WBC count is stable, and there is no clear etiology for her fever and leukocytosis. The patient's clinical respiratory pattern suggests pulmonary fibrosis versus rind. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a history of ARDS, which can lead to severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing respiratory failure.
2. Infectious Causes: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate an ongoing infection. Despite treatment with multiple antibiotics, the source of infection remains unclear.
3. Bronchiolitis Obliterate Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP): The patient's peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP, a condition characterized by inflammation and scarring of the small airways.
4. Pulmonary Fibrosis: The patient's clinical respiratory pattern suggests pulmonary fibrosis, which is a long-term complication of ARDS.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has met alkalosis, which may be due to vomiting or other"

   improving. Dead space 82% from 84%.
          Continue periods of PMV
   with PSV 5/5, avoiding resp fatigue.
   - stopped diuresis

   Persistent respiratory failure-- fibrotic stage of ARDS. PAH. Markedly
   elevated dead space ventilation. Respiratory status seems to be
   slightly improved..
   I doubt that there is a secondary, treatable process, but the
   peribronchovascular distribution of parenchymal opacities on chest CT
   makes BOOP a consideration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia. She presents for re-admission to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) due to increased O2 requirement and being afebrile for the past four days. The patient has completed treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. She was started on vancomycin and zosyn due to worsening symptoms. Thoracentesis was performed bilaterally on December 24th and 25th due to concern of empyema. The patient underwent tracheostomy on December 25th. She continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety. Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple bronchs have been done, and there does not appear to be a current pneumonia since there are no secretions. There is a concern for inflammatory causes less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophilia. The differential includes infectious causes vs. BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia). The patient's peribronchovascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP over the typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids, and until a clear diagnosis is made, it would be difficult to justify steroids in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged woman with a history of anxiety, fever of unknown origin, rash, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired knowledge, electrolyte & fluid disorder, constipation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, and pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and is receiving various treatments including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but she is experiencing mild respiratory distress with increased work of breathing. Physical examination shows coarse breath sounds throughout with occasional wheezes, trace LE edema bilateral and symmetric, and intact neurologic function. Lab results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, and abnormal values in other lab parameters such as Cr, TCO2, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever, respiratory distress, and abnormal chest sounds, could indicate a possible infection in the lungs, which may progress to pneumonia if not treated promptly.
2. ARDS: Given the patient's history of ARDS, there is a risk of deterioration in her respiratory status, leading to further impairment in gas exchange and potential respiratory failure.
3. Constipation: The patient's current medication and immobilization could contribute to constipation, which can be"

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good airway hygiene, optimizing the patient's head position, and regularly assessing and repositioning the endotracheal tube.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation. The patient should be assessed for DVT risk factors, and prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin or intermittent compression devices should be considered.

3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of medications like corticosteroids can predispose the patient to stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be considered to reduce"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement, afebrile for
   past three days.
   .
   # ARDS
 Currently does not meet P/F ratio criteria and does not have
   typical pattern. Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Sedation was switched from propofol to versed and fentanyl. Multiple
   bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a current PNA
   since there are not any secretions. Concern for inflammatory causes
   less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or peripheral eosinophillia.
   Differential includes infectious cause vs. BOOP. There has been a poor
   response to antbiotics and no secretions on bronch argues against PNA.
   Patients peribroncholar vascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP
   over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids
   and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to justify steroids in the
   setting of possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies
   of the ARDS would require tissue bx. This would require VATS but the
   patient does not have enough lung reserve to take down one lung for the
   procedure. The patient
s clinical resp pattern is consistent with
   pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind. Patient got PSV valve placed on [**12-30**], resp
   status improving. Dead space 82% from 84%.
   - IP did not feel thoracentesis would be beneficial
   - stopped diuresis
   - will continue to try short trials of CPAP/PSV
   - speech trial and eval by S&S today
   - will discuss pHTN treatment
   - will continue to try to increase amount of time on PSV
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes T tonight.
   - ID following, rechecking c diff
   - no peripheral eosinophillia or bronchial fluid eosinophillia
   - ID recs to continue linezolid, day of [**3-25**]
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - urine grew yeast and wound [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans

   # met alkalosis
 no vomiting
   -          will give K to attempt to reduce.
   -          .
   #  Anemia
 in range from 23-27
   - will transfuse for less than 21

   - giving ativan as well
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   -Continue Geodon
   - consider restarting Ritalin

   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks
 location, symptoms do not appear c/w drug reaction.  Likely
   contact dermatitis or fungal infection.
   - c/w cutaneous candidiasis -> tx with fluconazole for 1 wk
   # dispo
 not ready for rehab at this time, still doing workup, want to
   see improvement in white count and determine source of infection or
   give steroid trial
   FEN: getting tube feeds, replete lytes PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement, afebrile for
   past four days.
   .
   # ARDS
 Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Multiple bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a
   current PNA since there are not any secretions. Concern for
   inflammatory causes less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or
   peripheral eosinophillia. Differential includes infectious cause vs.
   BOOP. There has been a poor response to antbiotics and no secretions on
   bronch argues against PNA. Patients peribronchovascular pattern could
   be consistent with BOOP over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require
   treatment with steroids and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to
   justify steroids in the setting of possible infectious cause.
   Differentiation of the etiologies of the ARDS would require tissue bx.
   This would require VATS but the patient does not have enough lung
   reserve to take down one lung for the procedure. The patient
s clinical
   resp pattern is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind. IP did not
   feel thoracentesis would be beneficial. Patient got PSV valve placed on
   [**12-30**], resp status improving.
   - Continue periods of PMV, trach mask and PSV 5/5, avoiding resp
   fatigue
   - patient would not be a good candidate for vasodialtors such as
   slidenafil or NO
   - will not tx with steroids
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes a fever.
   - ID following, negative c diff
   - 7-day course of linezolid finished [**1-1**], fluconazole ends [**1-3**] for
   cutaneous candidiasis
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - foley changed [**1-1**]
   .
   # Met alkalosis
 likely combination of compensation for respiratory
   acidosis and contraction alkalosis
   -          will check VBG and give diamox depending on CO2/HCO3 level
   .
   #  Anemia
 stable
   -          received one unit PRBC yesterday, appropriately increased
   HCT to 31.6
   -          limit tx [**12-21**] concern for fluid overload
   .
   # Depression
 followed by  (outpt psych)
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   - Continue Geodon
   - Intermittent Ativan
   .
   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks
 location, symptoms do not appear c/w drug reaction.  Likely
   contact dermatitis or fungal infection.
   - c/w cutaneous candidiasis -> tx with fluconazole, last day [**1-3**]
   # FEN: getting tube feeds, replete lytes PRN, patient has severe
   cachexia
   -          nutrition recs increasing TFs by 5cc/hr (do not want to
   increase CO2 production too much given baseline tachypnea)
   -          Speech consult will do swallow eval when tolerating PSV 5/5
   with PMV for longer periods

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and H. flu bacteremia. She was admitted to the MICU for increased O2 requirement and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has completed treatment for H. flu bacteremia with azithromycin and a 7-day empiric course of meropenem. She was also given vanc/zosyn. Bilateral thoracentesis was performed on [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] due to concern for empyema. The patient is trached and continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety. Multiple bronchs have been done, and there does not appear to be a current PNA (Pneumonia) since there are no secretions. The differential includes an infectious cause vs. BOOP (Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia). There has been a poor response to antibiotics and no secretions on bronch argue against PNA. The patient's peribronchovascular pattern could be consistent with BOOP over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require treatment with steroids, and until a clear diagnosis is made, it would be difficult to justify steroids in the setting of a possible infectious cause. Differentiation of the etiologies of ARDS would require tissue bx (biopsy), which would require VATS"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange. She has a history of anxiety and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has tracheostomy placement. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/74 to 128/101 mmHg, respiratory rate between 18-41 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's neurological examination is intact, with normal strength and orientation. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has a rash that has improved, and her muscle performance is impaired. She has a history of constipation and is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with a high-calorie enteral feeding regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins of her legs due to immobility and other risk factors.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement, afebrile for
   past four days.
   .
   # ARDS
 Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Multiple bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a
   current PNA since there are not any secretions. Concern for
   inflammatory causes less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or
   peripheral eosinophillia. Differential includes infectious cause vs.
   BOOP. There has been a poor response to antbiotics and no secretions on
   bronch argues against PNA. Patients peribronchovascular pattern could
   be consistent with BOOP over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require
   treatment with steroids and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to
   justify steroids in the setting of possible infectious cause.
   Differentiation of the etiologies of the ARDS would require tissue bx.
   This would require VATS but the patient does not have enough lung
   reserve to take down one lung for the procedure. The patient
s clinical
   resp pattern is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind. IP did not
   feel thoracentesis would be beneficial. Patient got PSV valve placed on
   [**12-30**], resp status improving.
   - Continue periods of PMV with PSV 5/5, avoiding resp fatigue
   - stopped diuresis
   - patient would not be a good candidate for vasodialtors such as
   slidenafil or NO
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes a fever.
   - ID following, negative c diff
   - 7-day course of linezolid finished [**1-1**], fluconazole ends [**1-3**]
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - foley changed [**1-1**]
   .
   # Met alkalosis - no vomiting
   -          will give K to attempt to reduce.
   -          has received diamox
   .
   #  Anemia
 in range from 23-27
   - will transfuse for less than 21
   .
   # Depression
 followed by  (outpt psych)
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   - Continue Geodon
   - Intermittent Ativan
   .
   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks
 location, symptoms do not appear c/w drug reaction.  Likely
   contact dermatitis or fungal infection.
   - c/w cutaneous candidiasis -> tx with fluconazole, last day [**1-3**]
   # FEN: getting tube feeds, replete lytes PRN, patient has severe
   cachexia
   -          nutrition recs increasing TFs by 5cc/hr (do not want to
   increase CO2 production too much given baseline tachypnea)
   -          Speech consult will do swallow eval when tolerating PSV 5/5
   with PMV for longer periods

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo female with resolving ARDS and H. flu bacteremia presents for
   re-admission to the MICU for increased O2 requirement, afebrile for
   past four days.
   .
   # ARDS
 Patient has documented dead space of 84%. Patient had
   completed a course of treatment for known H. flu bacteremia with
   azithromycin, 7 day empiric course of meropenem. After worsening around
   [**12-20**], patient was started on vanc/zosyn. On [**12-24**] and [**12-25**] [**Female First Name (un) **] was done
   bilaterally for concern of empyema. Patient was trached on [**12-25**]. Patient
   continues to be tachypneic in the 30-40s with an element of anxiety.
   Multiple bronchs have been done and there does not appear to be a
   current PNA since there are not any secretions. Concern for
   inflammatory causes less in the setting of no bronchial fluid or
   peripheral eosinophillia. Differential includes infectious cause vs.
   BOOP. There has been a poor response to antbiotics and no secretions on
   bronch argues against PNA. Patients peribronchovascular pattern could
   be consistent with BOOP over typical ARDS picture. BOOP would require
   treatment with steroids and until clear diagnosis is made difficult to
   justify steroids in the setting of possible infectious cause.
   Differentiation of the etiologies of the ARDS would require tissue bx.
   This would require VATS but the patient does not have enough lung
   reserve to take down one lung for the procedure. The patient
s clinical
   resp pattern is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis vs. rind. IP did not
   feel thoracentesis would be beneficial. Patient got PSV valve placed on
   [**12-30**], resp status improving.
   - Continue periods of PMV, trach mask and PSV 5/5, avoiding resp
   fatigue
   - patient would not be a good candidate for vasodialtors such as
   slidenafil or NO
   - will not tx with steroids
   .
   # Fever and Leukocytosis
 WBC stable, unclear etiology for patient's
   fever and leukocytosis.  Blood cultures NTD, VRE in urine but not
   likely source of infection. Cardiac echo, no evidence of endocarditis.
   No evidence of empyemas on [**Female First Name (un) **], pan-scan negative. Stopped Flagyl for
   cdiff b/c not consistent with lab or clinical findings.  Bilateral
   thoracentesis with no infectious organism identified.  Derm bx was
   consistent with fungal infection and their recs were to give a week of
   Fluconazole.  Will consider PO vanc if spikes a fever.
   - ID following, negative c diff
   - 7-day course of linezolid finished [**1-1**], fluconazole ends [**1-3**] for
   cutaneous candidiasis
   - follow-up cultures, no obvious source yet
   - foley changed [**1-1**]
   .
   # Met alkalosis
 likely combination of compensation for respiratory
   acidosis and contraction alkalosis
   -          will check VBG and give diamox depending on CO2/HCO3 level
   .
   #  Anemia
 stable
   -          received one unit PRBC yesterday, appropriately increased
   HCT to 31.6
   -          limit tx [**12-21**] concern for fluid overload
   .
   # Depression
 followed by  (outpt psych)
   - prozac dose to 80 mg daily
   - Continue Geodon
   - Intermittent Ativan
   .
   # Rash: Pt with papular rash and occasional pustules on lower back,
   buttocks
 location, symptoms do not appear c/w drug reaction.  Likely
   contact dermatitis or fungal infection.
   - c/w cutaneous candidiasis -> tx with fluconazole, last day [**1-3**]
   # FEN: getting tube feeds, replete lytes PRN, patient has severe
   cachexia
   -          nutrition recs increasing TFs by 5cc/hr (do not want to
   increase CO2 production too much given baseline tachypnea)
   -          Speech consult will do swallow eval when tolerating PSV 5/5
   with PMV for longer periods
   Prophy: Heparin SQ, scheduled bowel regimen, switched from PPI to
   randitine to reduce drug interactions
