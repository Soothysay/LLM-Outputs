   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity, OSA (noncompliance on BIPAP),
   COPD, history of PE. Since admission, pt treated with azithro for
   bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - continue azithro and broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP
   (vanc/cefepime) if clinical condition deteriorates or becomes febrile.
   - continue IV lasix for goal -1L (pt received laxix IV 40mg x 2
   overnight after BNP showed 5977)
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for atrial fibrillation
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue nebs
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       COPD
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   - continue heparin (one more day) and coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - order B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and right lower extremity (RLE) pain. She has been treated with azithromycin for bronchitis and started on heparin for subtherapeutic INR. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, hypercarbia, somnolence, atrial fibrillation, and worsening respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial due to obesity, OSA (noncompliance with BIPAP), COPD, and a history of PE. The causes of respiratory failure include infection, PE, congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), and OSA. 
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and her symptoms could be due to an exacerbation of this condition.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and initial presentation clinically concerning for PE. 
4. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient has a history of OSA, and her symptoms may be related to OSA"

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), history of PE. Since admission, pt treated
   with azithro for bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - discontinue azithro (patient has completed 5 day course)
   - broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP (vanc/cefepime) if clinical
   condition deteriorates or becomes febrile
   - continue IV lasix 40mg for goal -2L for today to treat right sided
   heart failure
   - start lasix drip
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - calculate urine anion gap
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          restart coumadin tomorrow (INR today was 3.1)
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - followup B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   -          change home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She presented with right lower extremity pain and shortness of breath. She was treated with azithromycin for bronchitis and started on heparin for subtherapeutic INR. The patient has desaturations/somnolence and was found to be taking off her BiPAP overnight with SaO2=40%. She is currently on CPAP mask with SpO2: 98% and ABG drawn 7.31, 56, 69 (on mask). Third set of cardiac enzymes to be drawn in the morning. EKG shows atrial fibrillation. Hypoxia is likely due to right heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or obstructive sleep apnea. Allergies are documented from Hospital 85 Medical records.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be caused by multiple factors including infection, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or obstructive sleep apnea.
2. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma, which is an obstructive lung disease. She is currently on Advair and montelukast for this"

   INPATIENT
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), possibly history of PE. ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now
   increased to 30. Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA,
   developing CHF, infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and
   echo was normal.
   - continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her if not bleeding.
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels
   were above reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and right lower extremity (RLE) pain. The patient was bridged into therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) with heparin and warfarin. On the floor, she desaturated and became somnolent after removing her bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) mask while sleeping.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, obstructive lung disease, PE, OSA, anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic pain, type 2 DM, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She has a history of atrial fibrillation.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   - decrease IV lasix to 4mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - transition to bolus lasix
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures from yesterday
   - repeat sputum cultures today given productive cough
   - CXR today given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit.
   - give 5mg metoprolol IV push now
   - discontinue 5mg IV Q6H metoprolol and start home regimen of 25mg PO
   TID (if unsuccessful at controlling rate, consider esmolol or
   diltiazem)
   - continue warfarin for anticoagulation (goal INR [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her with vitamin K if not bleeding.
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol 25mg TID
   7.       Anemia
  MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels were above
   reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with right lower extremity (RLE) pain and shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to be hypoxic and hypercarbic upon admission.

The patient has been placed on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and therapeutic INR with heparin and warfarin. Her condition has been monitored closely, and she has undergone several tests including a trans-thoracic echo, sputum culture, and blood cultures.

The patient's vital signs have been stable with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 91-129 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/99-124/99 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her blood gases show respiratory acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation.

The patient has also shown signs of atrial fibrillation and has been treated accordingly. Her renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. Additionally, she has anemia with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 107, but her B12 and folate levels are within normal range. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit. Pt still
   tachycardic.
   - continue increased regimen of 37.5mg PO TID (if unsuccessful at
   controlling rate, consider esmolol or diltiazem)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE. Pt also has Afib.
   - continue coumadin as above
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She presented with shortness of breath and right lower extremity pain and is now experiencing worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence. The patient has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) controlled on metoprolol. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia suggest respiratory failure, which could be due to her underlying restrictive lung disease from obesity, OSA, or developing congestive heart failure (CHF), infection, or other causes.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of controlled Afib on metoprolol but is still experiencing tachycardia in the ICU. Rate control measures should be continued or adjusted as necessary.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's history of PE and current presentation, it is important to continue anticoagulation with coumadin.
4. Obstructive Lung Disease: The patient has asthma, and her respiratory symptoms may be exacerbated by this condition.
5. Obstructive Sleep Ap"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib. Pt still tachycardic.
   - increase metoprolol to 50.0mg PO TID (esmolol not appropriate because
   it is only available IV)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       Altered Mental Status
 patient not at baseline mental status
   according to PCP and nurses who have cared for her previously.  Most
   likely due to delirium from hospital stay (passive variant).
   - Gentle reorientation (talking, getting her out of bed)
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.  Improving as evidenced by
   decreasing Cre.  Perfusion improving after fluid reduction.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She presented with shortness of breath and right lower extremity pain, now showing worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence. She has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled on metoprolol. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 143/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on CPAP, and an arterial blood gas showing respiratory acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial due to obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA (noncompliance on BIPAP), and possible developing congestive heart failure or infection. She has a productive cough and has been given lasix 80mg PO, with improvement in response. BIPAP settings have been titrated for best ventilation, and she has been placed on nasal cannula during the day and mask at night. Daily arterial blood gas monitoring and sputum cultures have been ordered. The patient's altered mental status is most likely due to delirium"
