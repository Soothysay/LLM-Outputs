   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology.  Per report, found down, could
   have been post-ictal but wouldn't not fully explain need for
   intubation.  ED reports ""significant respiratory distress"" but no
   hypoxemia recorded.  Could also have had aspiration event.  Dissection
   could result in tamponade, but no evidence of this at this point.  A-a
   gradient 153 (20 normal for age) indicative of impaired defusion or V-Q
   mismatching.
   - Wean propofol, to assess improved AMS (CT surgery wants 4 extremities
   moving and that she can understand)
   - Wean vent as able
   - Chlorhexadine
   - RSBI daily with SBT as able
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  Could also be exacerbated by new CVA
   with resultant HTN causing extension of tear.  CT Surgery consulted in
   ED but hesistant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anticoagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   - Discuss surgery with CT surgery
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection. ?CVA on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5**], negative CT
   at [**Location (un) 196**].  Brain MRI shows multiple b/l acute-subacute deep
   hemispheric infarcts in different vasacular territories, likely
   secondary to the dissection. Looks embolic.  Per Neuro consult,
   alternative causes could include seizures and a post-ictal state or
   non-convulsive status. These causes also seem less likely as she has a
   history of focal motor seizures without any history of generalized
   events per her husband.  [**Name (NI) 6**] been on propofol on and off all day, so
   likely etiology of AMS.
   - Per Neuro: should stop propofol, and goal to extubate, continue ASA,
   don't start heparin
   - Follow-up brain MRI
   - EEG
   - Continue Neurontin
   - Hold LP until other more reasonable causes ruled-out
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - treat UTI
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt for tighter control, goal SBP 120-130
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible, though unlikely, etiology of AMS
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   -          Hold ASA given possible surgery
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.
   -          Cipro 200mg IV BID x 3 days
   -          Follow-up [**Location (un) 196**] labs / microbiology
   F: Give IV x 1L given NPO for prolonged period & approx 30cc/hr uop
   E: Replete K
   N: NPO for potential surgery, NGT in place
   Access: 3 PIV (placed [**2105-9-17**])
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN
   CODE: Presumed Full (per discussion with husband, patient did
   previously sign a DNR/DNI but this may have been related to more
   chronic situations)
   Communication: [**Name (NI) 67**], husband and HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1833**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1834**]
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down and diagnosed with acute confusion, multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. She has a known history of thoracic aneurysm.
- She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, but the exact cause of her respiratory distress is unclear.
- The patient's aortic dissection is believed to be caused by a ruptured known aneurysm or traumatic event, possibly exacerbated by a new CVA resulting in high blood pressure and extension of the tear.
- CT surgery consulted in the emergency department but was hesitant to take her to the operating room due to her altered mental status (AMS) and concerns about poor surgical outcomes.
- The patient's AMS is likely secondary to the dissection, with alternative causes such as seizures or a post-ictal state considered less likely.
- The neurology team recommends stopping propofol, aiming for extubation, continuing aspirin, and ruling out other potential causes before considering a lumbar puncture.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- She is currently being treated with esmolol to control blood pressure, chlorhexidine for skin care, and ciprofloxacin for the UTI.
- The patient's family has discussed her presumed full code"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology.  Per report, found down, could
   have been post-ictal but wouldn't not fully explain need for
   intubation.  ED reports ""significant respiratory distress"" but no
   hypoxemia recorded.  Could also have had aspiration event.  Dissection
   could result in tamponade, but no evidence of this at this point.  A-a
   gradient 153 (20 normal for age) indicative of impaired defusion or V-Q
   mismatching.
   - Wean propofol, to assess improved AMS (CT surgery wants 4 extremities
   moving and that she can understand)
   - Wean vent as able
   - Chlorhexadine
   - RSBI daily with SBT as able
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  Could also be exacerbated by new CVA
   with resultant HTN causing extension of tear.  CT Surgery consulted in
   ED but hesistant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anticoagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   - Neurology and CT surgery teams have both evaluated patient
   decisions must be made as to course of action today.
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection. ?CVA on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5**], negative CT
   at [**Location (un) 196**].  Brain MRI shows multiple b/l acute-subacute deep
   hemispheric infarcts in different vasacular territories, likely
   secondary to the dissection. Looks embolic.  Per Neuro consult,
   alternative causes could include seizures and a post-ictal state or
   non-convulsive status. These causes also seem less likely as she has a
   history of focal motor seizures without any history of generalized
   events per her husband.  [**Name (NI) 6**] been on propofol on and off all day, so
   likely etiology of AMS.
   - Per Neuro: should stop propofol, and goal to extubate, continue ASA,
   don't start heparin
   - Follow-up brain MRI
   - EEG
 report pending, though preliminary read is not status
   epilepticus.
   - Continue Neurontin
   - LP attempt for the morning
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   - Treat UTI
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt for tighter control, goal SBP 120-130
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible, though unlikely, etiology of AMS
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   -          Hold ASA given possible surgery
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.
   -          Cipro 200mg IV BID x 3 days
   -          Follow-up [**Location (un) 196**] labs / microbiology
   F: Give IV x 1L given NPO for prolonged period & approx 30cc/hr uop

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The cause of her respiratory failure is unclear, with possible etiologies including aspiration, impaired diffusion, or ventilation-perfusion mismatch. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition requires careful management, considering the potential risks and benefits of surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Dissection: The patient's aortic dissection may worsen if not managed appropriately. Surgical intervention may be necessary to repair the dissection, but this poses risks of hemorrhagic conversion of the small CVAs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure needs to be addressed promptly to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator should be done gradually once her condition improves.
3. AMS: The patient's altered mental status requires close monitoring and evaluation. Propofol administration should be stopped, and efforts should be made to extubate her. An EEG and follow-up brain MRI are recommended to further assess her neurologic status.
4. UTI: Treating the urinary tract infection is crucial to prevent any further complications. Antibiotics have been"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute stroke syndrome, thoracic aortic aneurysm dissection (Type I).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated for airway protection.  Radiograph
   suggests LLL infiltrate, possible pneumonia --> antibiotics.
   CVA -- acute stroke (lacunes) may be related to aortic dissection.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/UNRESPONSIVENESS -- may be related to stroke
   syndrome, and medications (sedatives).  Now improved since d/c'd
   propofol.  Continue to monitor.
   THORACIC ANEURYSM (AORTIC) -- Type I dissection.  Continue to control
   BP (SBP <120).  Await improvement in neurological status prior to
   proceeding to surgery.  Await decision for surgery.
   BACK PAIN -- chronic.  Pain control as per usual meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation, as pt. may be pre-op.
   HYPERTENSION -- management with iv esmolol.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- manage blood glucose <150.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal and possible influence of radiologic contast
   (ATN).  At risk for dissection distal to initial site --> renal
   arteries at risk.  Plan iv repletetion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Replete.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute stroke syndrome, thoracic aortic aneurysm dissection (Type I).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated for airway protection.  Radiograph
   suggests LLL infiltrate, possible pneumonia --> antibiotics.
   CVA -- acute stroke (lacunes) may be related to aortic dissection.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/UNRESPONSIVENESS -- may be related to stroke
   syndrome, and medications (sedatives).  Now improved since d/c'd
   propofol.
   THORACIC ANEURYSM (AORTIC) -- Type I dissection.  Continue to control
   BP (SBP <120).  Await decision for surgery.
   BACK PAIN -- chronic.  Pain control as per usual meds.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation, as pt. may be pre-op.
   HYPERTENSION -- management with iv esmolol.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- manage blood glucose <150.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal and possible influence of radiologic contast
   (ATN).  At risk for dissection distal to initial site --> renal
   arteries at risk.  Plan iv repletetion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Replete.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Unclear etiology.  Per report, found down, could
   have been post-ictal but wouldn't not fully explain need for
   intubation.  ED reports ""significant respiratory distress"" but no
   hypoxemia recorded.  Could also have had aspiration event.  Dissection
   could result in tamponade, but no evidence of this at this point.  A-a
   gradient 153 (20 normal for age) indicative of impaired defusion or V-Q
   mismatching.
   - Wean propofol, to assess improved AMS (CT surgery wants 4 extremities
   moving and that she can understand)
   - Wean vent as able
   - Chlorhexadine
   - RSBI daily with SBT as able
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  Could also be exacerbated by new CVA
   with resultant HTN causing extension of tear.  CT Surgery consulted in
   ED but hesistant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anticoagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   - Neurology and CT surgery teams have both evaluated patient
   decisions must be made as to course of action today.
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection. ?CVA on MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5**], negative CT
   at [**Location (un) 196**].  Brain MRI shows multiple b/l acute-subacute deep
   hemispheric infarcts in different vasacular territories, likely
   secondary to the dissection. Looks embolic.  Per Neuro consult,
   alternative causes could include seizures and a post-ictal state or
   non-convulsive status. These causes also seem less likely as she has a
   history of focal motor seizures without any history of generalized
   events per her husband.  [**Name (NI) 6**] been on propofol on and off all day, so
   likely etiology of AMS.
   - Per Neuro: should stop propofol, and goal to extubate, continue ASA,
   don't start heparin
   - Follow-up brain MRI
   - EEG
 report pending, though preliminary read is not status
   epilepticus.
   - Continue Neurontin
   - LP attempt for the morning
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   - Treat UTI
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt for tighter control, goal SBP 120-130
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible, though unlikely, etiology of AMS
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm who presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found down by her husband. The patient has multiple medical conditions including aortic dissection, respiratory failure, AMS, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease.

The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which showed a dissection of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve. The MRI brain revealed multiple bilateral acute-subacute deep hemispheric infarcts in different vascular territories, likely secondary to the dissection and looking embolic.

The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in etiology, but it could be due to a post-ictal state, aspiration event, or impaired diffusion/perfusion mismatch. The A-a gradient is elevated, indicating impaired oxygenation.

The patient's AMS is likely secondary to the dissection, and there is a concern for seizures and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status. The Neuro consult suggests stopping propofol, continuing ASA, and not starting heparin. An EEG report is pending, though preliminary read is not status epilepticus.

The patient's hypertension is not well controlled, and she has been placed on esmolol for tighter blood pressure control. She also has hypothyroidism and is on Levoxyl.

The patient's history of CAD is unclear"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient underwent emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. On the first postoperative day, the patient experienced an episode of hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Subsequently, the patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI) and required hemodialysis. The patient's clinical course was further complicated by the development of pneumonia and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated serum creatinine levels indicate the presence of AKI. This condition can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, increased white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Prompt antibiotic therapy and respiratory support may be necessary.
3. Sepsis: The combination of pneumonia and AKI increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ functions is essential for early detection and management of sepsis.
4. Dissection to noncoronary cusps of aortic valve: This condition can lead to aortic regurgitation and compromise cardiac output. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and echocardiographic evaluation may be needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Extubated. Maintaining pH, O2 sats. Has
   asymmetric chest expansion and CXR c/w possible R lobar collapse. Will
   need to maintain NPO status to avoid further aspiration events.
   - NT suctioning to try to inflate lung, remove mucus plug. Would like
   to avoid procedures that require sedation such as bronch since may
   cloud mental status eval
   - NPO for now
   - For aspiration, would continue CTX and add flagyl if spikes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  CT Surgery consulted in ED but
   hesistant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anticoagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will
   reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery.
   Will need to [**Last Name (un) 1919**] into what med would be added on since now maxed out on
   current meds
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   - Neurology and CT surgery teams have both evaluated patient
   decisions must be made as to course of action as pt reassessed on daily
   basis
   - F/U CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely
   embolic.  Per Neuro consult, alternative causes could include seizures
   and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status. EEG was negative.
   Extubated so more clearly able to assess mental status. Will follow
   erial neuro exams,
   - Continue Neurontin
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   - Treat UTI
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt as above for tighter
   control, goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.
   -          Cipro changed to Cefrtriaxone per neuro recs, day [**2-2**] but
   will continue given aspiration

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. She has a history of known thoracic aneurysm. The patient was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband and is now extubated. She has asymmetric chest expansion and a chest X-ray showing possible right lobar collapse. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP. 

Her laboratory results show white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, sodium of 116 mg/dL, potassium of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 161 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. The urine culture shows 3000 colony-forming units of streptococcus, while the blood culture is negative. 

The patient is being treated with esmolol, nicardipine for blood pressure control, and neurontin for seizures. She is also on lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and receiving IV fluids. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to possible right lobar collapse, aspiration events, a"

   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Extubated. Maintaining pH, O2 sats. Has
   asymmetric chest expansion and CXR c/w possible R lobar collapse. Will
   need to maintain NPO status to avoid further aspiration events.
   - NT suctioning to try to inflate lung, remove mucus plug. Would like
   to avoid procedures that require sedation such as bronch since may
   cloud mental status eval
   - NPO for now
   - For aspiration, would continue CTX and add flagyl if spikes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  CT Surgery consulted in ED but
   hesistant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anticoagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will
   reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery.
   Will need to [**Last Name (un) 1919**] into what med would be added on since now maxed out on
   current meds
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   - Neurology and CT surgery teams have both evaluated patient
   decisions must be made as to course of action as pt reassessed on daily
   basis
   - F/U CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely
   embolic.  Per Neuro consult, alternative causes could include seizures
   and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status. EEG was negative.
   Extubated so more clearly able to assess mental status. Will follow
   erial neuro exams,
   - Continue Neurontin
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   - Treat UTI
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt as above for tighter
   control, goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has a history of known thoracic aneurysm and was found to have acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. The patient was initially intubated but experienced periextubation emesis and there is a concern for aspiration. She underwent a transthoracic echo, MRI, and EEG, all of which showed evidence of central embolic events, likely causing the multifocal infarcts seen on MRI. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs and mental status.

The patient's respiratory status has been a concern, with asymmetric chest expansion and a possible right lobar collapse on chest X-ray. She has been maintained on nasal CPAP to support her breathing. The plan is to keep her NPO to avoid further aspiration events and suction her as needed to try and inflate the collapsed lung.

Regarding the aortic dissection, the etiology is likely the rupture of the known aneurysm versus traumatic intubation. CT Surgery has been consulted but is hesitant to take her to the operating room due to her altered mental status and concerns about a poor outcome. There is also a concern for hemorrhagic conversion of the small CVAs if anticoagulation is initiated for surgery. The plan is to reassess the patient's condition with CT ["

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and is now diagnosed with acute cardiovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. She has a history of known thoracic aneurysm and is currently extubated. The patient has respiratory failure with asymmetric chest expansion and a possible right lobar collapse, which requires maintaining NPO status to prevent further aspiration events. The etiology of the aortic dissection is likely the rupture of the known aneurysm or traumatic failed intubation. CT surgery has been consulted, but there are concerns about operating on a patient with AMS and the potential for poor outcomes. There is also a concern about anticoagulation during surgery leading to hemorrhagic conversion of the small CVAs. Neurology has been consulted as well, and decisions need to be made regarding the course of action. The patient is also being treated for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible urinary tract infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to possible right lobar collapse and the need to maintain NPO status.
2. Aortic dissection and the risk of rupture or further complications during surgery.
3. Hemorrhagic conversion of the small CVAs due to anticoagulation during surgery.
4. Poor outcomes and potential worsening of AMS during surgery.
5. Hypotension and hypertension control with the current medications (E"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Extubated. Maintaining pH, O2 sats. Has
   asymmetric chest expansion and CXR c/w possible R lobar collapse. Will
   need to maintain NPO status to avoid further aspiration events.
   - NT suctioning to try to inflate lung, remove mucus plug. Still
   attempting to avoid procedures that require sedation, in order to
   interfere with her mental status as little as possible.
   - NPO for now in anticipation of surgical intervention, though
   unlikely.
   - For aspiration, would continue CTX and add flagyl if spikes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  CT Surgery consulted in ED but
   hesitant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anti-coagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will
   reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - To follow up with Neuro and CT surgery regarding final decisions.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery.
   Will need to look into what med would be added on since now maxed out
   on current meds
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely
   embolic.  Per Neuro consult, alternative causes could include seizures
   and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status. EEG was negative.
   Extubated so more clearly able to assess mental status. Will follow
   erial neuro exams,
   - Continue Neurontin when able to take PO
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt as above for tighter
   control, goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.
   -          Completed course of Cefrtriaxone for UTI, but continued in
   the setting of aspiration
   -          Follow-up [**Location (un) 196**] labs / microbiology
   F: Bolus prn < 30cc/hr uop. Had good UOP yesterday
   E: Replete lytes prn
   N: NPO given aspiration risk, though will attempt to pass Dobhoff tube
   and begin perenteral nutrition via PICC.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.  Central line will be
   d/c
d and replaced.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN
   CODE: Presumed Full (per discussion with husband, patient did
   previously sign a DNR/DNI, but husband would like her to be involved in

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband.
- She has a history of known thoracic aneurysm and is now presenting with acute cardiovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm.
- The patient has respiratory failure and was intubated but is now extubated and maintaining oxygen saturation levels.
- She has asymmetric chest expansion and a chest X-ray indicating possible right lobar collapse.
- The patient is at high risk for aspiration events, so she is currently on NPO status.
- The patient's aortic dissection is likely due to the rupture of her known aneurysm or traumatic failed intubation.
- CT Surgery was consulted but is hesitant to take her to the operating room due to AMS and concerns about her poor outcome.
- She may need anti-coagulation for surgery, which could result in hemorrhagic conversion of her small CVAs.
- Neurology was consulted to reassess plans for surgery and discuss the possibility of poor outcomes.
- The patient's mental status is likely secondary to the dissection and multifocal infarcts, which are likely embolic in origin.
- Other potential causes of AMS include seizures and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status.
- An EEG was negative, and the patient is being closely monitored for any changes in mental status.
- The patient has a history of"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Extubated. Maintaining pH, O2 sats. Has
   asymmetric chest expansion and CXR c/w possible R lobar collapse. Will
   need to maintain NPO status to avoid further aspiration events.
   - NT suctioning to try to inflate lung, remove mucus plug. Still
   attempting to avoid procedures that require sedation, in order to
   interfere with her mental status as little as possible.
   - NPO for now in anticipation of surgical intervention, though
   unlikely.
   - For aspiration, would continue CTX and add flagyl if spikes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  CT Surgery consulted in ED but
   hesitant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anti-coagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will
   reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - To follow up with Neuro and CT surgery regarding final decisions.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery.
   Will need to look into what med would be added on since now maxed out
   on current meds
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely
   embolic.  Per Neuro consult, alternative causes could include seizures
   and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status. EEG was negative.
   Extubated so more clearly able to assess mental status. Will follow
   erial neuro exams,
   - Continue Neurontin when able to take PO
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt as above for tighter
   control, goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.
   -          Completed course of Cefrtriaxone for UTI, but continued in
   the setting of aspiration
   -          Follow-up [**Location (un) 196**] labs / microbiology
   F: Bolus prn < 30cc/hr uop. Had good UOP yesterday
   E: Replete lytes prn
   N: NPO given aspiration risk, though will attempt to pass Dobhoff tube
   and begin perenteral nutrition via PICC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cardiovascular accidents (CVAs), and dissecting aortic aneurysm. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. The patient is currently extubated, maintaining pH and O2 saturation, but has asymmetric chest expansion and a chest X-ray indicating possible right lobar collapse. She is NPO to avoid further aspiration events.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now extubated and maintaining pH and O2 saturation. However, she has asymmetric chest expansion and a chest X-ray suggesting possible right lobar collapse. She will need to be maintained NPO to prevent further aspiration events. NT suctioning will be attempted to inflate the lung and remove mucus plugs.
2. Aortic Dissection: The etiology is likely the rupture of a known aneurysm or traumatic intubation. CT surgery was consulted in the emergency department but is hesitant to take the patient to the operating room due to AMS and concerns about a poor outcome. There is also a concern for hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [Doctor First Name 91] will follow up and reassess plans for surgery and consult with Neurology.
3. AMS: The likely cause is secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely embolic. An alternative cause could be seizures and a post-ictal state"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has had acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and is currently experiencing a dissecting aortic aneurysm. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, aortic dissection, altered mental status, hypertension, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient has been intubated and extubated, and is now on non-rebreather mask with a saturation of 89%. She is maintaining pH and oxygen saturation levels but has asymmetric chest expansion and a chest X-ray indicating possible right lobar collapse. 

She is NPO (nothing by mouth) to prevent further aspiration events, and NT suctioning is being performed to try to inflate the collapsed lung and remove any mucus plug. 

The patient has received a course of ceftriaxone for UTI but is still at risk for aspiration. 

Regarding the aortic dissection, it is believed to be due to the rupture of a known aneurysm or traumatic failed intubation. CT surgery was consulted but hesitant to take her to the operating room given her AMS and concern for poor outcome. 

The plan is to reassess surgical plans with Dr. [**Doctor First Name"

   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic anuerysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Extubated. Maintaining pH, O2 sats. Has
   asymmetric chest expansion and CXR c/w possible R lobar collapse. Will
   need to maintain NPO status to avoid further aspiration events.
   - NT suctioning to try to inflate lung, remove mucus plug.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  CT Surgery consulted in ED but
   hesitant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anti-coagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will
   reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - To follow up with Neuro and CT surgery regarding final decisions.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt, goal SBP 120 per CT Surgery.
   Will need to look into what med would be added on since now maxed out
   on current meds
   - Q2H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely
   embolic.  Per Neuro consult, alternative causes could include seizures
   and a post-ictal state or non-convulsive status. EEG was negative.
   Extubated so more clearly able to assess mental status. Will follow
   erial neuro exams,
   - Continue Neurontin when able to take PO
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt as above for tighter
   control, goal SBP less than 120

   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status by her husband. She has a history of known thoracic aneurysm and was found to have acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure, and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. She is currently extubated but maintaining oxygen saturation with the use of a non-rebreather mask. There are concerns about possible right lobar collapse, and efforts are being made to inflate the lung and remove any mucus plug. 

The patient's aortic dissection is believed to be caused by the rupture of a known aneurysm or traumatic intubation failure. CT surgery was consulted but is hesitant to take the patient to the operating room due to altered mental status and concerns about a poor outcome. There is also a concern that surgery could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. Neurology and CT surgery will reassess plans for surgery and discuss further.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to the dissection and multifocal infarcts likely embolic. An EEG was negative, ruling out seizures and post-ictal state as alternative causes. Neuro exams will continue to be performed, and Neurontin will be continued when the patient is able to take oral medication.

The patient has a history of hypertension, with"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. They have a history of multiple strokes, leading to poor neurological improvement. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the weekend, with progressive decline in mental status despite initial improvement. They remain extubated but require increasing oxygen levels. Blood pressure control is achieved through the use of esmolol and nicardipine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 127/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight status, and no signs of pallor or edema. The patient's lungs show clear breath sounds with no crackles or wheezing. The abdominal examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination shows decreased tone and sedation. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's chest X-ray suggests volume overload. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Insufficiency: The patient's respiratory distress and poor progression since extubation indicate a high risk of respiratory insufficiency. The paradoxical thoraco-abdominal motion and agonal breathing pattern further support this concern.
2. Thoracic Aneurysm Dissection: The patient has been diagnosed with a type"

   perform LP.  Hope to perform EEG off sedatives.  Will  need intubation
   for head MRI and LP attempt (will need LP in Fluorscopy with recent
   lumbar spine surgeries).
   THORACIC ANEURYSM DISSECTION -- type I; not surgical candidate due to
   poor neurological status.
   HYPERTENSION -- good control on esmolol and nicardipine.
   FLUIDS -- volume overlaod.  Plan net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and requires ongoing intensive care.

The patient has a history of encephalopathy and has experienced progressive neurological decline since admission. They were previously extubated but are now experiencing increasing oxygen requirements, indicating respiratory insufficiency. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese, and no signs of conjunctival pallor or edema. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and blood pressure within acceptable ranges. Respiratory examination demonstrates diminished breath sounds on the right side and crackles bilaterally. Neurological examination reveals decreased mental status and sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Liver function tests, including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, are normal. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's renal function is impaired as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

The patient has several potential medical complications including respiratory insufficiency, thoracic aneurysm dissection (type"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Extubated. Maintaining pH, O2 sats. Has
   asymmetric chest expansion and CXR c/w possible R lobar collapse. Will
   need to maintain NPO status to avoid further aspiration events.
   - NT suctioning to try to inflate lung, remove mucus plug.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - To meet with family in the afternoon with Neurology and MICU
   attending in order to further discuss current status and goals of care.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm vs
   traumatic [**1-3**] failed intubation.  CT Surgery consulted in ED but
   hesitant to take to OR given AMS and concern for poor outcome.
   Additionally, would likely anti-coagulate for surgery and could result
   in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will
   reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate.
   - Continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt, with a goal of SBP 120. Will
   need to look into what med would be added on since now maxed out on
   current meds.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts likely
   embolic.  Per Neuro consult, alternative causes could include seizures
   and a postictal state or non-convulsive status. EEG was negative.
   Extubated so more clearly able to assess mental status. Will follow
   serial neuro exams,
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: reassess neurologic status this morning, hold
   AEDs, cont. neurontin.
   - Hold sedation unless family decides to redirect goals of care.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Esmolol gtt, Nicardipine gtt as above for tighter
   control, goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Not on
   Metoprolol and Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   # UTI: Noted on UA at [**Location (un) 196**].  No report in records.  Also with
   leukocytosis which could be reactive vs infectious etiology.
   - Completed course of Cefrtriaxone for UTI, but continued in the
   setting of aspiration
   - Follow-up [**Location (un) 196**] labs / microbiology
   F: Administered lasix and will monitor UOP.
   E: Replete lytes prn
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.  Central line will be
   d/c
d and replaced.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN
   CODE: DNR/DNI with the intention of continuing conversation with her
   husband regarding the goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She now presents with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm, in addition to a known thoracic aneurysm. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease (CAD). She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and leukocytosis. The patient was intubated for invasive ventilation and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture (LP). She is currently on multiple medications, including esmolol, nicardipine, propofol, Lasix, and diltiazem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated but still requires respiratory support. Asymmetric chest expansion and a possible right lobar collapse are noted on the chest X-ray. The patient needs to be maintained NPO (nothing by mouth) to prevent further aspiration events. Suctioning and chest physiotherapy may be required to clear secretions and prevent lung collapse.

2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a known thoracic aneurysm, and the current presentation suggests a possible rupture leading to aortic dissection. Surgical consultation has been sought, but the patient's altered mental status (AMS) and small cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) may pose significant risks"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected aortic dissection, which was confirmed on CT scan. The patient underwent an emergency MRI/MRA and an IR-guided LP. The patient's condition is unstable and required intubation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 90s and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient has been on Propofol infusion for sedation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of sodium, potassium, and glucose. However, there is a slight elevation in creatinine levels. The white blood cell count is within normal range. The platelet count is stable. Other lab results, including liver function tests, kidney function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with assist/control mode, Vt set at 420 mL, RR set at 20, and FiO2 at 60%. The patient's RSBI is 130, PIP is 20 cmH2O, plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O, and compliance is 32.3 cmH2O/mL. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on the ventilator.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Intubated.
   - Will decrease respiratory rate and FiO2 given current ABG, and will
   recheck ABG after vent change.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - To continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG,
   MRI/MRA and LP return.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate.
   - Propofol is sufficient to maintain goal SBP of 120. Started on
   Metoprolol PO via Dobhoff tube to control rate and BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts
   potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown etiology due
   to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging studies.. Will follow
   serial neuro exams,
   - Rpt EEG and MRI/MRA obtained and awaiting final reads.
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: hold AEDs, obtain MRI/MRA, EEG and LP.
   - Propofol has a short half life and can be discontinued to assess
   mental status after imaging studies and LP are obtained.
   #Afib with RVR: pt has two episodes in the last 24 hours of an
   uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with Afib with RVR.
   - IV boluses of metoprolol administered
   - Placed on a Dilt gtt at 20mg/hr
   - Placed on Metoprolol 12.5 PO via the Dobhoff with the intention of
   increasing the PO dose, in order to decrease the overall amount of
   fluid intake and transition to a more stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol and diltiazem gtt and PO metoprolol to achieve
   a goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of -1 to -1.5
   L today.
   E: Replete lytes prn
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.  Central line will be
   d/c

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and dissecting aortic aneurysm. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, cardiovascular disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She underwent an MRI/MRA and LP for further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary. Adjustments to FiO2 and respiratory rate may be required based on ABG results.

2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has an aortic dissection likely caused by the rupture of a known aneurysm. Surgery consultation was obtained, but the patient is not considered an operative candidate due to AMS. The decision to proceed with surgery will depend on the improvement in mental status.

3. Acute Cerebrovascular Accidents (CVAs): The patient has experienced multiple CVAs, resulting in AMS. Neurological checks will be performed regularly, and repeat EEG and MRI/MRA are pending.

4. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled to prevent further complications. Propofol and diltiazem infusions will be continued, and the goal SBP"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, for which they were intubated. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's history indicates that they experienced new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-Fib with RVR) this morning, but without hypotension. This required the administration of intravenous diltiazem. The patient's blood pressure is adequately controlled, and they are on sedation alone.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics administered was ceftriaxone at 05:12 AM on 09/22/2105.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/72 mmHg to 86/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Flowsheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight or obese appearance, no conjunctival edema, and normal breath sounds. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be sedated and unable to follow commands or respond to tactile stimuli.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count,"

   Imaging
   [**9-22**] Echo
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild
   resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic arch is markedly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate ventricular hypertrophy
   with small LV cavity and hyperdynamic function. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta and markedly dilated arch. Impaired relaxation.
   Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-9-18**], the
   previously visualized aortic dissection/hematoma is not as well
   visualized.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, remains mildly sedated on
   propofol. Failed RSBI this am. Not tolerating PSV in am so changed back
   to AC. Minimal vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %. ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT, sedation
   holidays
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - Continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG, MRI/MRA
   and LP return.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs
   although per Nuerology low risk. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] no longer following but will
   call today given improvement in MS
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate. Will ask to reeval
   today given improved MS
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID titrated to SBP
   via Dobhoff tube to control rate and BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Improved this am. Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal
   infarcts potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown
   etiology due to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies.. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP negative for infxn.
   - Follow up final reads EEG and MRI/MRA, LP
   - Follow-up Neuro recs. Will d/w CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] when could go to OR, ? start
   ASA pending if OR planned
   - Propofol has a short half life and can be discontinued to assess
   mental status
   #Afib with RVR: pt has two episodes in the last 24 hours of an
   uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with Afib with RVR. Now off Dilt
   gtt, on Metoprolol 12.5 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   - Continue Metoprolol 12.5 PO TID via the Dobhoff titrated to BP and HR
   with the intention of increasing the PO dose, in order to decrease the
   overall amount of fluid intake and transition to a more stable rate
   control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of even to
   -500 L today. 1300 cc negative yesterday

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and dissecting aortic aneurysm. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and is now intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease. She is currently on multiple medications including propofol, metoprolol, lasix, and levoxyl. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation. We need to closely monitor her respiratory status and wean off the ventilator when appropriate. Daily readiness to extubate assessments and spontaneous breathing trials should be performed.
2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a dissecting aortic aneurysm, which requires close monitoring. Surgical consultation is pending, but the patient's current mental status and risk of hemorrhagic conversion of the CVA may pose challenges for surgery.
3. AMS: The patient's mental status has improved, but she remains at risk for further neurological deterioration. Regular neurologic checks should be performed, and follow-up EEG and MRI/MRA results should be reviewed.
4. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, and possible coronary artery disease."

   Imaging
   [**9-22**] Echo
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild
   resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic arch is markedly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate ventricular hypertrophy
   with small LV cavity and hyperdynamic function. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta and markedly dilated arch. Impaired relaxation.
   Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-9-18**], the
   previously visualized aortic dissection/hematoma is not as well
   visualized.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Intubated, remains sedated on propofol.
   Failed RSBI this am
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Will decrease respiratory rate and FiO2 given current ABG, and will
   recheck ABG after vent change.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - To continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG,
   MRI/MRA and LP return.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate.
   - Propofol is sufficient to maintain goal SBP of 120. Started on
   Metoprolol PO via Dobhoff tube to control rate and BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts
   potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown etiology due
   to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging studies.. Will follow
   serial neuro exams,
   - Rpt EEG and MRI/MRA obtained and awaiting final reads.
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: hold AEDs, obtain MRI/MRA, EEG and LP.
   - Propofol has a short half life and can be discontinued to assess
   mental status after imaging studies and LP are obtained.
   #Afib with RVR: pt has two episodes in the last 24 hours of an
   uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with Afib with RVR.
   - IV boluses of metoprolol administered
   - Placed on a Dilt gtt at 20mg/hr
   - Placed on Metoprolol 12.5 PO via the Dobhoff with the intention of
   increasing the PO dose, in order to decrease the overall amount of
   fluid intake and transition to a more stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol and diltiazem gtt and PO metoprolol to achieve
   a goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cardiovascular accidents (CVAs), and dissecting aortic aneurysm. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband and subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) and has been receiving various medications including propofol, metoprolol, and diltiazem. Imaging studies such as an echo, MRI/MRA, and EEG are pending. The patient is currently sedated on propofol and remains intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilator settings may be necessary as her condition improves.
2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a known aneurysm and is currently experiencing an aortic dissection. Surgery may be required, but the patient's mental status and risk of hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs need to be considered.
3. Acute Cardiovascular Accidents (CVAs): The patient has had multiple CVAs, which may have contributed to her altered mental status.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored"

   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild
   resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic arch is markedly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate ventricular hypertrophy
   with small LV cavity and hyperdynamic function. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta and markedly dilated arch. Impaired relaxation.
   Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-9-18**], the
   previously visualized aortic dissection/hematoma is not as well

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Intubated.
   - Will decrease respiratory rate and FiO2 given current ABG, and will
   recheck ABG after vent change.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - To continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG,
   MRI/MRA and LP return.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate.
   - Propofol is sufficient to maintain goal SBP of 120. Started on
   Metoprolol PO via Dobhoff tube to control rate and BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts
   potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown etiology due
   to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging studies.. Will follow
   serial neuro exams,
   - Rpt EEG and MRI/MRA obtained and awaiting final reads.
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: hold AEDs, obtain MRI/MRA, EEG and LP.
   - Propofol has a short half life and can be discontinued to assess
   mental status after imaging studies and LP are obtained.
   #Afib with RVR: pt has two episodes in the last 24 hours of an
   uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with Afib with RVR.
   - IV boluses of metoprolol administered
   - Placed on a Dilt gtt at 20mg/hr
   - Placed on Metoprolol 12.5 PO via the Dobhoff with the intention of
   increasing the PO dose, in order to decrease the overall amount of
   fluid intake and transition to a more stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol and diltiazem gtt and PO metoprolol to achieve
   a goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and dissecting aortic aneurysm. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and respiratory failure, leading to intubation. Imaging studies revealed moderate ventricular hypertrophy, small left ventricular cavity, hyperdynamic function, moderately dilated ascending aorta, markedly dilated arch, impaired relaxation, and borderline pulmonary hypertension. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Aortic dissection with potential rupture, leading to hemorrhagic shock.
3. Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) with neurological deficits.
4. Hypotension and shock due to ongoing blood loss from the dissecting aortic aneurysm.
5. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or ischemic heart disease.
6. Infection or sepsis, particularly given the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
8. Stress-related mucosal disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Acute kidney injury"

   through retrograde flow.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Intubated.
   - Will decrease respiratory rate and FiO2 given current ABG, and will
   recheck ABG after vent change.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - To continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG,
   MRI/MRA and LP return.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate.
   - Propofol is sufficient to maintain goal SBP of 120. Started on
   Metoprolol PO via Dobhoff tube to control rate and BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts
   potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown etiology due
   to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging studies.. Will follow
   serial neuro exams,
   - Rpt EEG and MRI/MRA obtained and awaiting final reads.
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: hold AEDs, obtain MRI/MRA, EEG and LP.
   - Propofol has a short half life and can be discontinued to assess
   mental status after imaging studies and LP are obtained.
   #Afib with RVR: pt has two episodes in the last 24 hours of an
   uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with Afib with RVR.
   - IV boluses of metoprolol administered
   - Placed on a Dilt gtt at 20mg/hr
   - Placed on Metoprolol 12.5 PO via the Dobhoff with the intention of
   increasing the PO dose, in order to decrease the overall amount of
   fluid intake and transition to a more stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol and diltiazem gtt and PO metoprolol to achieve
   a goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Infusions: Propofol at 20 mcg/Kg/min, Diltiazem, Metoprolol, and Morphine sulfate.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs: Tmax 38.1 C (100.6 F), Tcurrent 36.7 C (98.1 F), HR 82 bpm (75-137 bpm), BP 121/55 mmHg (75-141/77-94 mmHg), RR 25 insp/min (13-27 insp/min), SpO2 98%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information provided.
- Physical examination findings: Peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments not assessed.
- Labs/Radiology: Blood cultures obtained on 09/22/2105 at 06:02 PM, 06:08 PM, 12:14 AM, 03:01 AM, 06:55 AM, and 04:31 PM. Blood tests show elevated WBC count and slightly decreased Hct and Plt levels. Other lab results within normal range.
- Assessment and Plan: ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (arterial and PICC), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), code status, disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation is required to determine the source and appropriate treatment.
2. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance chart shows an overall negative balance of 1,351 mL since 12 AM. This could suggest inadequate fluid resuscitation or excessive fluid losses.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, and FiO2 at 50%. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory parameters, such as RSBI and ABG, is essential to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure readings are within normal limits, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in cardiovascular stability.
5. Neurological status: Due to the patient's unassessed neurologic examination findings, it is crucial to closely monitor his mental status, movement, tone, and other neurological parameters for any signs of deterioration.
6. Medication management: The patient is receiving multiple medications including propofol, diltiazem, metoprolol, and morphine sulfate. Regular assessment of drug efficacy, side effects, and potential interactions is necessary.
7. Line infections: The presence of arterial and PICC lines increases the risk of line-related infections. Frequent assessment of line sites and appropriate care are essential to prevent complications.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin, should be considered.
9. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, which may be indicated due to his critical condition. Monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now Intubated.
   - Will decrease respiratory rate and FiO2 given current ABG, and will
   recheck ABG after vent change.
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns.
   - To continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG,
   MRI/MRA and LP return.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following, will reassess plans for surgery and d/w Neurology
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on CT Surgery said that pt was not an operative candidate
   given her current mental status, and if her mental status were to
   improve, CT surgical service would re-evaluate.
   - Propofol is sufficient to maintain goal SBP of 120. Started on
   Metoprolol PO via Dobhoff tube to control rate and BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts
   potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown etiology due
   to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging studies.. Will follow
   serial neuro exams,
   - Rpt EEG and MRI/MRA obtained and awaiting final reads.
   - Follow-up Neuro recs: hold AEDs, obtain MRI/MRA, EEG and LP.
   - Propofol has a short half life and can be discontinued to assess
   mental status after imaging studies and LP are obtained.
   #Afib with RVR: pt has two episodes in the last 24 hours of an
   uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with Afib with RVR.
   - IV boluses of metoprolol administered
   - Placed on a Dilt gtt at 20mg/hr
   - Placed on Metoprolol 12.5 PO via the Dobhoff with the intention of
   increasing the PO dose, in order to decrease the overall amount of
   fluid intake and transition to a more stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol and diltiazem gtt and PO metoprolol to achieve
   a goal SBP less than 120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - Check TSH as possible
   - po Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of -1 to -1.5
   L today.
   E: Replete lytes prn
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has a history of known thoracic aneurysm and is now presenting with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1351 mL since 12 AM, with total input of 2449 mL and total output of 3800 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.9 x 10^9/L, slightly low platelet count (Plt) at 299 x 10^9/L, elevated troponin-T level of 0.5 ng/mL, and other abnormal values in electrolytes and kidney function tests.

   Imaging
   [**9-22**] Echo
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function
   is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a mild
   resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic arch is markedly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
   There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate ventricular hypertrophy
   with small LV cavity and hyperdynamic function. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta and markedly dilated arch. Impaired relaxation.
   Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-9-18**], the
   previously visualized aortic dissection/hematoma is not as well
   visualized.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, remains mildly sedated on
   propofol. Failed RSBI this am. Not tolerating PSV in am so changed back
   to AC. Minimal vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %. ABG with mild resp
   alkalosis
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns, PNA, will add Vanco given GPC
   in sputum.
   - Continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG, MRI/MRA
   and LP return.
   - Vanco 1g IV q12 for GPC sputum, check trough after 3rd dose
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs
   although per Nuerology low risk. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] no longer following but will
   call today given improvement in MS. [**First Name (Titles) 2007**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2008**] risk with NP
   from CT surgery and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Patient not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate at this
   time.
   - Not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt Extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Add Esmolol
   and titrate up Metoprolol as needed for BP control
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Improved this am. Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal
   infarcts potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown
   etiology due to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies.. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP negative for infxn.
   - Follow up final reads EEG and MRI/MRA, LP
   - Follow-up Neuro recs. Restarted ASA as per neurology recs, was ok
   with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status, neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR. Now off Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 12.5 PO
   TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control with the intention of increasing the PO dose in order to
   decrease the overall amount of fluid intake and transition to a more
   stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   #Fever: Pt had isolated spike in fever overnight then defervesced. Most
   obvious source is pulmonary given infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Currently
   on Ceftriaxone. Blood, sputum cultures were pending. Sputum cx retunred
   as GPC and MRSA screen was positive so will treat with Vanco and await
   final C and S
   -          Add Vanco to cover possible MRSA PNA
   -          If spikes will add Zosyn for gram negative including
   Pseudomonas
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalaprilat and PO metoprolol to achieve a
   goal SBP 100-120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, acute cardiovascular events, and respiratory failure. She underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) and was found to have a moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic function. The patient also has a markedly dilated aortic arch and impaired relaxation. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with minimal settings. The patient's mental status has improved, but she remains mildly sedated on propofol. She has been started on metoprolol for rate control and to maintain a blood pressure goal of 100-120. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated for possible gram-positive cocci (GPC) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She has a history of hypothyroidism, controlled with levothyroxine, and chronic atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and she is receiving IV lasix for fluid management. She has been prescribed prophylactic anticoagulation due to her immobility and risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and discussion with the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires continued monitoring and management."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient remains somnulant but is able to arouse. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, review of systems, and physical examination are unchanged from admission except as noted above.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including an EKG, lumbar puncture, and pan culture. They have received various medications, including propofol, metoprolol, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 130/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 420 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 32.3 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 311 K/uL, blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of <0.01 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. Other lab results, including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, and cardiac enzymes, are provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure with an unclear etiology, possible contribution from CVA and pneumonia. The patient is also diagnosed with pneumonia and will continue antimicrobials, potentially broadening them if needed. The patient has a type I aortic dissection and is not a surgical candidate at the moment, pending neurological evaluation. The patient is also being monitored for atrial fibrillation, somnolance (unclear etiology), and possible new or evolving CVA, awaiting MRI read.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition via Nutren Pulmonary at 25 mL/hour, glycemic control, arterial and peripheral intravenous catheters, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with elevation of head of bed, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system compliance monitoring (RSBI). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 55 minutes, and they are critically ill."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure of unclear etiology. They have been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient is somnulant but can arouse to voice, with slow response and minimal movement. They have a history of aortic aneurysm dissection, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and possible evolving cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is a critical condition requiring immediate medical intervention. If not managed properly, it can lead to further deterioration in the patient's condition.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen if not effectively treated with appropriate antimicrobials. Inadequate treatment may result in the progression of the infection and potentially lead to sepsis or other complications.

3. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a type I aortic dissection, a serious condition that requires close monitoring and management. If the dissection continues to progress or ruptures, it can be life-threatening.

4. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient may have a new or evolving CVA, which can cause neurological deficits and impact their overall prognosis. Prompt evaluation and management are necessary to minimize any potential long-term consequences.

5. Sedation and Propofol Use: The patient is currently sedated,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, remains mildly sedated on
   propofol. Failed RSBI this am, 164. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %. Could decrease FiO2. PNA and
   fluid overload likely prohibiting successful RSBIs and extubation.
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for n concerns, PNA, will add Vanco given GPC in
   sputum.
   - Continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG, MRI/MRA
   and LP return.
   - Vanco and Zosyn for possible VAP
   - Increas PO metoprolol to attempt to control HR and BP, decrease ins
   with esmolol as weaned off
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs
   although per Nuerology low risk. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] no longer following but will
   call today given improvement in MS. [**First Name (Titles) 2007**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2008**] risk with NP
   from CT surgery and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Patient not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate at this
   time.
   - Not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt Extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Add Esmolol
   and titrate up Metoprolol as needed for BP control
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Improved this am. Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal
   infarcts potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown
   etiology due to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies.. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP negative for infxn.
   - Follow up final reads EEG and MRI/MRA, LP
   - Follow-up Neuro recs. Restarted ASA as per neurology recs, was ok
   with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status, neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR. Now off Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 12.5 PO
   TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control with the intention of increasing the PO dose in order to
   decrease the overall amount of fluid intake and transition to a more
   stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-23**]. Repeated blood cultures. Most
   obvious source is pulmonary given infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx
   growing coag pos staph, GNR on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx
   to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to cover VAP. Currently on Ceftriaxone. Blood,
   final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage
   -          If spikes will add Zosyn for gram negative including
   Pseudomonas
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalaprilat and PO metoprolol to achieve a
   goal SBP 100-120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered 20 IV lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of
   negative 1 liter since [**06**] liters positive for stay. Responds well to
   Lasix 20 IV
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, will add heparin SC given low risk hemorrhage per
   Neuro and pt immobile at high risk DVT, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute medical complications. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and subsequently diagnosed with acute cardiovascular accidents (CVAs) and dissecting aortic aneurysm. The patient has a history of known thoracic aneurysm. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and remains mildly sedated on propofol. She failed a spontaneous breathing trial this morning with a Respiratory System Blood Oxygen Index (RSBI) of 164. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings with a Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) of 5, and Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's pneumonia (PNA) and fluid overload are likely prohibiting successful spontaneous breathing trials and extubation.

2. Aortic Dissection: The etiology is likely the rupture of a known aneurysm. CT Surgery was consulted in the emergency department but hesitant to take the patient to the operating room due to AMS and concern for poor outcome. Additionally, the patient would be anticoagulated for surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs, although per Neurology, the risk is low. CT [Doctor First Name 91] is no longer following but will"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-inch tall individual who is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Neurorads: The patient has subacute strokes identified on a preliminary read, but they do not explain altered mental status.
2. CT Surgery: The patient is not considered a surgical candidate due to respiratory and neurological issues.
3. EEG: The EEG shows consistent encephalopathy and potential left focal epileptiform activity, but it does not explain the changes in mental status.
4. Cultures: The patient has positive cultures for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, gram-positive rods, and gram-negative rods. The sputum culture shows sparse growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus.
5. Medications: The patient is on various medications including metoprolol, lasix, propofol, esmolol, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam.
6. Vital Signs: The patient's temperature is elevated, with a maximum recorded at 101.5 degrees Celsius. Blood pressure is within a normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated, respiratory rate is low, and oxygen saturation is at 97%.
7. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total of 3,448 mL of fluids since midnight, with 1,396 mL being given intravenously. The patient's urine output is 2,570 mL since midnight.
8. Respiratory Support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 420 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 222 mmHg, and respiratory rate (RR) of 9.1 L/min.
9. Physical Examination: The patient is intubated and mildly sedated, with normal heart sounds and no murmurs. There are coarse vented breath sounds in the upper lung fields, and the patient has mild extremity edema.
10. Lab Results: The patient's blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium and magnesium.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, positive cultures, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory symptoms, abnormal ABG values, and low lung sounds may indicate the development of ARDS.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, positive cultures, and imaging findings may indicate the presence of pneumonia.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and extremity edema increase the risk of developing DVT.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital"

   alkalosis
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays
   - Continuing CTX for aspiration concerns, PNA, will add Vanco given GPC
   in sputum.
   - Continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG, MRI/MRA
   and LP return.
   - Vanco 1g IV q12 for GPC sputum, check trough after 3rd dose
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs
   although per Nuerology low risk. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] no longer following but will
   call today given improvement in MS. [**First Name (Titles) 2007**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2008**] risk with NP
   from CT surgery and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Patient not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate at this
   time.
   - Not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt Extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Add Esmolol
   and titrate up Metoprolol as needed for BP control
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Improved this am. Likely secondary to dissection and multifocal
   infarcts potentially embolic.  Per Neuro consult, AMS has unknown
   etiology due to motion artifact.  Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies.. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP negative for infxn.
   - Follow up final reads EEG and MRI/MRA, LP
   - Follow-up Neuro recs. Restarted ASA as per neurology recs, was ok
   with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status, neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR. Now off Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 12.5 PO
   TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control with the intention of increasing the PO dose in order to
   decrease the overall amount of fluid intake and transition to a more
   stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   #Fever: Pt had isolated spike in fever overnight then defervesced. Most
   obvious source is pulmonary given infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Currently
   on Ceftriaxone. Blood, sputum cultures were pending. Sputum cx retunred
   as GPC and MRSA screen was positive so will treat with Vanco and await
   final C and S
   -          Add Vanco to cover possible MRSA PNA
   -          If spikes will add Zosyn for gram negative including
   Pseudomonas
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalaprilat and PO metoprolol to achieve a
   goal SBP 100-120
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.

 with a goal of
   negative 1 liter since [**06**] liters positive for stay. Responds well to
   Lasix 20 IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of known thoracic aneurysm, found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has been diagnosed with acute cerebral vascular accidents (strokes) and a dissecting aortic aneurysm. The patient is intubated and remains mildly sedated on propofol. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG showing mild respiratory alkalosis. 

The patient has a fever spike overnight, which has since defervesced. Blood and sputum cultures were pending, with sputum culture returning positive for GPC. The patient is being treated with Vancomycin and awaiting final cultures. 

The patient's blood pressure is being maintained at 100-120 with propofol, metoprolol PO TID, and esmolol. The neuro checks are being done every 4 hours as able. 

The patient's AMS has improved this morning and is likely secondary to the dissection and multifocal infarcts potentially embolic. The patient underwent reintubation for imaging studies, and the EEG and MRI/MRA are pending. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), currently off diltiazem gtt, and on metoprolol 12.5 PO TID with good rate control currently"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple subacute strokes that do not explain altered mental status. The patient's respiratory and neurologic status make them a non-surgical candidate. They have a history of GPCs in sputum, GNR in sputum, and sparse growth of coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transitioned from ceftriaxone to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to a fever spike. They are currently being titrated to maintain a systolic blood pressure below 120 with propofol and esmolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, indicating a need for respiratory support. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever spikes and has a history of GPCs and GNR in sputum. The presence of coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus raises concerns about a possible hospital-acquired infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection control measures should be continued to prevent further infections.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has multiple subacute strokes that do not explain altered mental status. Continued monitoring of neurological status and interventions to improve cerebral perfusion are important to minimize"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Continued evolution of the multiple embolic infarcts, in both
   cerebral
   hemispheres as well as in the right side of the pons and probably in
   the right
   cerebellar hemisphere, which may be real or artifactual.
   2. No obvious new large infarcts.
   3. Patent major intracranial arteries of the anterior circulation.
   Nonvisualization of the V3 and the majority of the V4 segments of the
   left
   vertebral artery, which may be due to absence/occlusion. However, the
   distalmost short segment of left vertebral artery is visualized, which
   may be
   filling by retrograde flow or through the ICA through some kind of
   communication.
   4. Patent major arteries of the neck without flow-limiting stenosis or
   occlusion. Left vertebral artery, diminutive in caliber likely related
   to
   hypoplasia.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %.
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever.
   - Continue discussions with family.
   - Increase PO metoprolol to attempt to control HR and BP, decrease ins
   with esmolol as weaned off since persistently positive despite adequate
   UOP
   - Diurese to 1.5-2 liters per day with Lasix
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  Seen
   by CT Surgery yesterday who reiterated that pt would not be good
   surgical candidate.
   - Not operative candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up
   Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP
   persistently elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP
   negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status and neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. Now off Dilt gtt, on
   Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-23**]. Sputum cx and blood cx now both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage. Will add Cipro for double
   coverage PsA since Levofloxacin lowers sz threshold
   -          Surveillance blood cx
   #UE edema: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**]. Consider DVT given
   immobility, not on DVT prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke) until yesterday.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   -          BL UE US to eval for DVT
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalaprilat and PO metoprolol to achieve a
   goal SBP 100-120, emolol prn but will try to avoid
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered 40 IV lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of
   negative 1.5-2 liters since [**06**] liters positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection.
- She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and is now intubated and sedated on propofol.
- The patient has respiratory failure, pneumonia (PNA), and pulmonary edema.
- She has a fever and positive blood and sputum cultures, indicating bacteremia and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has upper and lower extremity edema, likely due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR) and is currently on metoprolol for rate control.
- The patient has hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease (CAD), but the severity of her CAD is unclear.
- Her blood pressure and heart rate need to be controlled, and she is currently on multiple medications for this purpose.
- The patient's condition is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her PNA and pulmonary edema. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on her ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's positive blood and sputum cultures indicate bacteremia, which"

   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   dissecting aortic aneurysm with history of known thoracic aneurysm.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and fluid overload. ABG with
   mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %. Could
   decrease FiO2. PNA and fluid overload likely prohibiting successful
   RSBIs and extubation.
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever, ? VAP.
   - Continue discussions with family as the results of her EEG, MRI/MRA
   and LP return.
   - Increase PO metoprolol to attempt to control HR and BP, decrease ins
   with esmolol as weaned off since persistently positive despite adequate
   UOP
   - Diurese to 1.5-2 liters per day with Lasix
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  CT
   Surgery consulted in ED but hesitant to take to OR given AMS and
   concern for poor outcome.  Additionally, would anti-coagulate for
   surgery and could result in hemorrhagic conversion of small CVAs
   although per Nuerology low risk. CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] no longer following but will
   call today given improvement in MS. [**First Name (Titles) 2007**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2008**] risk with NP
   from CT surgery and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Patient not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate at this
   time.
   - Not [**First Name (STitle) 2008**] candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt Extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Add Esmolol
   and titrate up Metoprolol as needed for BP control
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Likely
   secondary to dissection and multifocal infarcts potentially embolic.
   Pt. re-intubated for imaging studies.. Will follow serial neuro exams.
   LP negative for infxn.
   - Follow up final reads EEG and MRI/MRA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs. Restarted ASA as per neurology recs, was ok
   with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status, neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR. Now off Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 12.5 PO
   TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control with the intention of increasing the PO dose in order to
   decrease the overall amount of fluid intake and transition to a more
   stable rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-23**]. Repeated blood cultures. Most
   obvious source is pulmonary given infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx
   growing coag pos staph, GNR on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx
   to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and

   -
   #UE edema: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**]. Consider DVT but would not
   anticoagulate given recent stroke so US would not change management,
   - Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalaprilat and PO metoprolol to achieve a

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute mental status changes (AMS), respiratory failure, aortic dissection, and a history of known thoracic aneurysm. She is currently intubated and sedated on propofol. The patient has failed spontaneous breathing trial (RSBI) likely due to AMS, pneumonia, and fluid overload. She has a fever, positive sputum culture for coag positive staph, and likely ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient's aortic dissection is thought to be caused by the rupture of a known aneurysm. CT surgery consultation was obtained, but the patient is not a surgical candidate at this time. The patient's AMS is stable, and an EEG and MRI/MRA are pending. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and hypothyroidism. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, lasix, heparin sodium, and enalaprilat. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected VAP. The patient has upper and lower extremity edema, likely due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic dissection: The patient has an aortic dissection that may lead to further complications such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   AORTIC DISSECTION -- type I; not surgical candidate at this time due to
   significantly altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pneumonia and CVAs
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed in part to CNS  process (multiple
   strokes), and complicated by active infection (pneumonia/bacteremia)
   CVA -- multiple, bilateral, cortical and deep.
   A-FIB --  rate controlled.  Monitor HR.
   FEVER -- attributed to pneumnia and bacteremia
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   EDEMA -- upper extremity > lower extremity.  Possibly related to aortic
   dissection, and volume resussitation.  Will check UE NIVS to assess for
   DVT.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple strokes, pneumonia, bacteremia, and aortic dissection. They are also experiencing altered mental status, fever, edema in the upper extremities, and nutritional support through tube feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function due to pneumonia and CVAs (multiple strokes).
2. Infection: The patient has an active infection, as indicated by fever and positive blood cultures for GPC. There is a risk of further infection spread or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a type I aortic dissection, which can lead to complications such as rupture, organ ischemia, or malperfusion syndromes.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to CNS processes (multiple strokes) and complicated by active infection (pneumonia/bacteremia). There is a risk of delirium or cognitive decline.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a desire for a net negative fluid balance, indicating the need for careful fluid management to prevent complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's edema"

   Assessment and Plan
   AORTIC DISSECTION -- type I; not surgical candidate at this time due to
   significantly altered mental status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pneumonia and CVAs
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed in part to CNS  process (multiple
   strokes), and complicated by active infection (pneumonia/bacteremia)
   and CHF.  Mild epileptiform waves on EEG
 will need continuous EEG if
   no improvement in mental status over time, or if overt seizures
   develop.
   CVA -- multiple, bilateral, predominately cortical and some deep.  No
   evolution.  Continue ASA.  Hope to allow full anticoagulation if no
   contraindication.
   A-FIB --  rate controlled.  Monitor HR.
   FEVER -- attributed to pneumnia and bacteremia
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   EDEMA -- upper extremity > lower extremity.  Possibly related to aortic
   dissection, and volume resussitation.  Will check UE NIVS to assess for
   DVT.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative balance.  Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities, including aortic dissection, pneumonia, multiple strokes, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and fever. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. Complications related to the ventilator or weaning from it could arise.
2. Aortic dissection: The patient has a type I aortic dissection, but they are not a surgical candidate at this time due to altered mental status. Complications such as aortic rupture or continued dissection propagation could occur.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and complications such as worsening lung infection or sepsis could develop.
4. Multiple strokes: The patient has had multiple strokes, and further neurological deterioration is a concern.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's CHF may worsen, leading to fluid overload or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and rate control measures need to be continued. Complications such as thromboembolism or heart rhythm instability could occur.
7. Fever: The patient's fever is attributed to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for various medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received Lasix 40 IV three times and had a repeat order for the same medication. The patient was also diagnosed with a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and had a midline catheter (DC'd) with placement of peripheral IVs. A new peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed in the left upper extremity. 

The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia to 160 when pressure support (PS) was decreased from 14 to 12, which resolved when the PS was increased back to its original level. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. 

Infusions include propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient also received furosemide (Lasix) at 10:00 PM on 09/24/2105. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), current temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate (HR) between 96 and 121 beats per minute (bpm"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %.
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever.
   - Continue discussions with family.
   - Increase PO metoprolol to attempt to control HR and BP, decrease ins
   with esmolol as weaned off since persistently positive despite adequate
   UOP
   - Diurese to 1.5-2 liters per day with Lasix
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  Seen
   by CT Surgery yesterday who reiterated that pt would not be good
   surgical candidate.
   - Not operative candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up
   Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP
   persistently elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP
   negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status and neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. Now off Dilt gtt, on
   Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-23**]. Sputum cx and blood cx now both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage. Will add Cipro for double
   coverage PsA since Levofloxacin lowers sz threshold
   -          Surveillance blood cx
   #UE edema: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**]. Consider DVT given
   immobility, not on DVT prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke) until yesterday.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   -          BL UE US to eval for DVT
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalaprilat and PO metoprolol to achieve a
   goal SBP 100-120, emolol prn but will try to avoid
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute mental status changes (AMS) and subsequently diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, thoracic aortic dissection, possible pneumonia with positive blood cultures, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), fever, and hypothyroidism. The patient has a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and possible coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a thoracic aortic dissection, which is a life-threatening condition requiring close monitoring for complications like rupture or worsening of the dissection.
3. Pneumonia: The positive blood cultures suggest a possible hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient's response to treatment should be closely monitored.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed DVT, increasing the risk of pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed with anticoagulation therapy.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient has experienced episodes"

   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up
   Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP
   persistently elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP
   negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status and neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. Now off Dilt gtt, on
   Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-23**]. Sputum cx and blood cx now both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage.

   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   -          Will discuss with Neurology and CT surgery to determine if
   anticoagulation is appropriate in the setting of CVAs and dissection.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal
   SBP 100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid
   load.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease. She is currently intubated and sedated on propofol, receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She has been diagnosed with right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and left upper extremity DVT. The patient's fever has been persistent, and blood cultures have shown positive growth of MRSA and GNR, indicating a likely bacteremia secondary to pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 122/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has shown signs of infection, including fever and positive blood cultures, indicating a possible pneumonia. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is necessary.
2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has been diagnosed with a thoracic aortic dissection. Non-operative management is recommended due to her unstable medical condition.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed DVT in both upper extremities. Anticoagulation therapy may be considered after consulting with neurology and cardiovascular surgery, considering her multiple"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated for airway protection.  Now with
   evidence for MRSA VAP --> antibiotics.   Hopefully work towards SBT as
   mental status improves.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC (?MRSA) --> Vanco.  Related to VAP vs. line
   infection..
   RUE DVT -- line-related.  Line d/c'd.  [**Month (only) 8**] benefit from
   anticoagulation, but need to clear with thoracic surgery.  Hopefully
   does not represent septic thrombophlebitis.
   AORTIC ANEURYSM -- type I; not surgical candidate unless neurological
   status (mental status) improves.
   FLUIDS -- net overloaded; desire net negative fluid balance of [**12-3**]
   L/24hrs
   CHF -- continue to treat with net diuresis.
   A-FIB
 PAF, rate controlled.  Would initiate anticoagulation if
   approved by Thoracic Surgery.
   CVA -- multiple, diffuse.  Stable.  Will need to better assess
   neurological status once extubated and acute medical conditoins
   improved.  Neurology recommends long term anticoagulation.
   WEAKNESS
 arm and leg weakness attributed to multiple strokes.  Need
   to assess over time to determine prognosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is evidence of MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which antibiotics have been initiated.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has GPC (likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin. The source of bacteremia could be related to VAP or a line infection.

3. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a line-related DVT. Anticoagulation therapy has been recommended, but clearance from thoracic surgery is pending. There is a concern for septic thrombophlebitis.

4. Aortic aneurysm: The patient has a type I aortic aneurysm, which is not a surgical candidate unless there is improvement in neurological status.

5. Fluid overload: The patient is net overloaded with fluids. A negative fluid balance of 12 L/24 hours is desired to manage congestive heart failure (CHF).

6. Chronic atrial fibrillation (A-FIB): The patient is rate-controlled with PAF, and anticoagulation is planned, subject to thoracic surgery approval.

7. Cerebrovascular accidents"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as
   tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation holidays although will need
   to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever
 5 day course, started on [**9-23**].
   - Continue discussions with family.
   - Diurese to 1.5-2 liters per day with Lasix again today.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  Seen
   by CT Surgery yesterday who reiterated that pt would not be good
   surgical candidate.
   - Not operative candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up
   Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP
   persistently elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP
   negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. Now off Dilt gtt, on
   Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control
   -          Started Heparin gtt with the intention of transitioning to
   coumadin when possible.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-26**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage.
   -          Surveillance blood cx
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   -          Will discuss with Neurology and CT surgery to determine if
   anticoagulation is appropriate in the setting of CVAs and dissection.
   -          Using Heparin gtt and will continue on PO coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered 40 IV lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of
   negative 1.5-2 liters since [**06**] liters positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings with PEEP 5, FiO2 50 %.
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation
   holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever
 5 day course.
   - Continue discussions with family.
   - Diurese to 1.5-2 liters per day with Lasix again today.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  Seen
   by CT Surgery yesterday who reiterated that pt would not be good
   surgical candidate.
   - Not operative candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up
   Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP
   persistently elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP
   negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Continue Propofol since has a short half life and can be discontinued
   to assess mental status and neuro exams
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. Now off Dilt gtt, on
   Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-23**]. Sputum cx and blood cx now both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage.
   -          Surveillance blood cx
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   -          Will discuss with Neurology and CT surgery to determine if
   anticoagulation is appropriate in the setting of CVAs and dissection.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Propofol, Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal
   SBP 100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid
   load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered 40 IV lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of
   negative 1.5-2 liters since [**06**] liters positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as
   tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation holidays although will need
   to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever
 7 day course, started on [**9-23**].
   - Diurese to 1 liters with Lasix again today PRN
 stop the standing
   lasix.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -         - Now off
   Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   - Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR control
   - Started Heparin gtt with the intention of transitioning to coumadin
   when possible.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-27**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage for 7 days started on [**9-23**].
   -          Surveillance blood cx follow up.
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt and will continue on PO coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of altered mental status, embolic CVAs, thoracic aortic dissection, right upper extremity DVT, and hypothyroidism. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been experiencing fevers, likely due to a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and has been placed on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 100.7 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on pressure support mode. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12,000/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 3.0 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 34 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and partial thromboplastin time of 61 seconds. Imaging studies reveal improved effusions on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and has failed spontaneous breathing trials. Weaning off the ventilator will be challenging due to persistent secretions and inability to control respiratory parameters.
2. Ventilator"

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been titrating heparin for a PTT of 60-70, receiving diuretics with TID lasix, and increased PS to ""rest overnight"" in anticipation of extubation. The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), electrolyte and fluid disorder, constipation, hypernatremia, fever, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), anxiety, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypokalemia, malnutrition, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), respiratory failure, benign hypertension, pain control, other tachycardia, aortic dissection, ischemic stroke, leukocytosis, and more.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which is a potential complication associated with prolonged immobility and hypercoagulable states.
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's labs indicate imbalances in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium levels, which can lead to various complications if not managed properly.
3. Constipation: The patient has been diagnosed with constipation, which can be caused by decreased mobility, medications, and other factors. If left untreated, it may"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as
   tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation holidays although will need
   to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever
 7 day course, started on [**9-23**].
   - Diurese to 1 liters with Lasix again today PRN
 stop the standing
   lasix.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -         - Now off
   Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   - Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR control
   - Started Heparin gtt with the intention of transitioning to coumadin
   when possible.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-27**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage for 7 days started on [**9-23**].
   -          Surveillance blood cx follow up.
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt and will continue on PO coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute mental status changes (AMS) by her husband. She was diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA) and pulmonary edema. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has upper and lower extremity edema, which may be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has a history of hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has been experiencing fevers, and blood cultures have grown MRSA and GNR, indicating possible bacteremia or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Her recent blood cultures are pending. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, ASA, heparin, and lansoprazole. The plan is to continue diuresis with lasix and optimize pulmonary status before weaning off the ventilator. The patient will also be re-consulted for CT if extubated and MS improves."

   - Diurese to 1.5-2 liters per day with Lasix again today.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.  Seen
   by CT Surgery yesterday who reiterated that pt would not be good
   surgical candidate.
   - Not operative candidate. Will reconsult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 with Propofol, Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up
   Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP
   persistently elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Will follow serial neuro exams. LP
   negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. Now off Dilt gtt, on
   Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR
   control
   -          Started Heparin gtt with the intention of transitioning to
   coumadin when possible.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-26**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage.
   -          Surveillance blood cx
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1.5-2 liters per day
   -          Will discuss with Neurology and CT surgery to determine if
   anticoagulation is appropriate in the setting of CVAs and dissection.
   -          Using Heparin gtt and will continue on PO coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.  Wasn
t on
   metoprolol or Lisinopril so unclear severity of underlying disease.
   F: Administered 40 IV lasix and will monitor UOP
 with a goal of
   negative 1.5-2 liters since [**06**] liters positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has since been diagnosed with acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been treated for pneumonia (PNA) and pulmonary edema with Vancomycin/Zosyn antibiotics, as well as diuretics for fluid management. The patient's conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), fever, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypothyroidism. Her blood cultures have grown MRSA and GNR, suggesting possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). She is being treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn for VAP coverage, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 70/46 mmHg to 100/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse vented breath sounds, rhonchi in anterior lung fields, diminished breath sounds in bases, and 3"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. Failed RSBI
   this am, 164 likely [**1-3**] AMS as well as PNA and pulmonary edema. ABG
   with mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as
   tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation holidays although will need
   to optimize pulmonary status first
   - On Vanc/Zosyn for PNA, fever
 7 day course, started on [**9-23**].
   - Diurese to 1 liters with Lasix again today PRN
 stop the standing
   lasix.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for infection, started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -         - Now off
   Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   - Will increase Metoprolol, titrate up for improved BP and HR control
   - Started Heparin gtt with the intention of transitioning to coumadin
   when possible.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-27**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP. Changed Abx to Vanc/Zosyn yesterday to
   cover VAP. Blood, final sputum cultures and [**Last Name (un) 46**] pending.
   -          Vanco/Zosyn for VAP coverage for 7 days started on [**9-23**].
   -          Surveillance blood cx follow up.
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt and will continue on PO coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line and 18 gauge are functional.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and later diagnosed with acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection.
- She is intubated and sedated on propofol due to respiratory failure, which was likely caused by aspiration pneumonia (PNA), pulmonary edema, and inadequate respiratory support.
- The patient has been on Vancomycin/Zosyn for PNA, and diuresis has been increased to 1 liter with Lasix.
- The aortic dissection is believed to be a result of a ruptured known aneurysm, and the patient is not an operative candidate.
- She is on metoprolol for blood pressure control and esmolol as needed.
- The cause of AMS/CVA is multifactorial, including infection and bacteremia, as well as multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR) and is now on metoprolol for rate control.
- She has developed fevers, positive sputum and blood cultures, suggesting bacteremia, likely secondary to PNA.
- The patient has upper and lower extremity edema, indicating possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. ABG with
   mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as
   tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation holidays although will need
   to optimize pulmonary status first.  Received Lasix 40mg IV yesterday
   and this AM with response of -700ml.
   - changed abx to Vanco, D/C Zosyn and Levo for MRSA in sputum
   - Diurese to 1 liters with Lasix again today, got 40IV Lasix this AM.
   - Diamox started today, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -         - Now off
   Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending
   consideration of potential aortic dissection repair
   -          Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-27**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP.
   -          Vancomycin started [**9-23**], will continue abx as pt is still
   febrile
   -          Surveillance blood cx follow up.
   -          Will check LFTs, amylase and lipase
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, no coumadin for now pending potential
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line will be replaced today, pt has midline LUE
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin SC, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 8 L positive for fluid status.
   - Changed abx to Vanco, following cultures before adding any
   antibiotics.
   - Diurese: begin Lasix drip
   - Diamox cont.today with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-29**]. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which
   is most likely from PNA given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration.
   Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Follow up LFTs, amylase and lipase
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. She was found down with altered mental status and was diagnosed with acute cerebral vascular accidents and a thoracic aortic dissection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been started on Vancomycin for suspected MRSA infection and Lasix for fluid overload. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has been treated with diamox. Her electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted as necessary. The patient's blood cultures have been sent and she is being treated empirically for pneumonia. She has also been diagnosed with upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and is receiving heparin therapy. The patient's fever is likely due to bacteremia, most likely from pneumonia given possible infiltrate and history of aspiration. Further follow-up blood, sputum, urine, and stool cultures are needed. The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled with medications such as enalapril and metoprolol, aiming for a blood pressure range of 100-120 mmHg. The patient's hypothyroidism should continue with regular dosing of Levoxyl. Given the acute illness, the TSH levels may be altered, and IV Levoxyl may be required. The patient's history of coronary artery disease with unclear control should be monitored, and she should continue with regular"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated, sedated on propofol. ABG with
   mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as
   tolerated, Daily RSBI and SBT with sedation holidays although will need
   to optimize pulmonary status first.  Received Lasix 40mg IV yesterday
   and this AM with response of -700ml.
   - changed abx to Vanco, D/C Zosyn and Levo for MRSA in sputum
   - Diurese to 1 liters with Lasix again today, got 40IV Lasix this AM.
   - Diamox started today, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -         - Now off
   Dilt gtt, on Metoprolol 50 PO TID with good rate control currently.
   -          Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending
   consideration of potential aortic dissection repair
   -          Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-27**]. Sputum cx and blood cx both
   positive. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which is most likely from PNA
   given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration. Sputum cx growing MRSA, GNR
   on gram stain, likely VAP/HCAP.
   -          Vancomycin started [**9-23**], will continue abx as pt is still
   febrile
   -          Surveillance blood cx follow up.
   -          Will check LFTs, amylase and lipase
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.  Not yet on on DVT
   prophylaxis ([**1-3**] stroke).
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, no coumadin for now pending potential
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Diltiazem and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line will be replaced today, pt has midline LUE

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute mental status changes (AMS) and is now experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD). 

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings. The plan is to wean vent settings as tolerated, perform daily respiratory system bilirubin index (RSBI) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with sedation holidays. 

The patient has been receiving diuretics (Lasix) to manage fluid overload, with a response of -700ml. She has also been started on diamox for metabolic alkalosis. 

The patient's aortic dissection is thought to be caused by a rupture of a known aneurysm. She is not an operative candidate at the moment, and it is planned to reconsult with a vascular surgeon if the patient is extubated and shows improvement in her mental status. 

The patient's AMS/CVA is stable, with mental status improving. She has been started on aspirin for CVA prevention. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR has been controlled with metoprolol,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 9 L positive for fluid status.
   - Abx broadened to Vanc + Zosyn, following cultures before adding any
   antibiotics.
   - Diurese: resuming Lasix drip with goal of -1L today, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Decrease evening dose of metoprolol as pt. becomes hypotensive at
   night, inhibiting diuresis.
   - Bedside ultrasound to eval pulmonary effusions and consider
   thoracentesis.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.  Neuro following, their recs appreciated.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol 75mg PO 6 am, 2 pm; 50 mg PO 10 pm
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-29**]. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which
   is most likely from PNA given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration.
   Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Follow up LFTs, amylase and lipase
   -          Consider thoracentesis for pleural effusion analysis.
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 9 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has since been diagnosed with acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her condition is complicated by multiple medical issues including suspected pneumonia with MRSA in the sputum, possible aspiration, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has suspected pneumonia with MRSA in the sputum, which indicates a possible bacterial infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased fever, and potentially septicemia.

2. Aortic dissection: The patient has been diagnosed with a thoracic aortic dissection, which is a serious condition where there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta. If the dissection progresses, it can cause life-threatening bleeding or rupture.

3. Stroke: The patient has had multiple acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), which are often referred to as strokes. These can result in long-term neurological deficits and disability if not managed promptly.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in respiratory function if"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 8 L positive for fluid status.
   - Changed abx to Vanco, following cultures before adding any
   antibiotics.
   - Diurese: begin Lasix drip
   - Diamox cont.today with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-29**]. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which
   is most likely from PNA given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration.
   Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Follow up LFTs, amylase and lipase
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient was found down by her husband and was diagnosed with acute CVAs and thoracic aortic dissection. She has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings. 

The patient's fever is likely due to bacteremia, most likely from pneumonia given possible infiltrate and history of aspiration. Sputum culture is growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

The patient has upper extremity (UE) edema, likely secondary to DVT. Diuretic therapy is being continued with a goal of negative 1 liter fluid balance. Heparin infusion has been started, and Coumadin is being held off for now.

The patient's blood pressure is being maintained between 100-120 mmHg with metoprolol and esmolol as needed. She is not an operative candidate for aortic dissection repair, so close monitoring of blood pressure is essential.

The patient's mental status is stable and improving, but she remains vent-dependent. She is also at risk for aspiration, so sed"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 8 L positive for fluid status.
   - Changed abx to Vanco, following cultures before adding any
   antibiotics.
   - Diurese: begin Lasix drip
   - Diamox cont.today with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-29**]. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which
   is most likely from PNA given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration.
   Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Follow up LFTs, amylase and lipase
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection.
- She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is intubated.
- Cultures have been taken and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
- She has upper and lower extremity edema, likely due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease (CAD).
- She is febrile and has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection.
- The patient's mental status is improving, but she remains ventilator dependent.
- She is receiving diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications for her conditions.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure of 101/57 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 8 L positive for fluid status.
   - Abx broadened to Vanco, following cultures before adding any
   antibiotics.
   - Diurese: begin Lasix drip
   - Diamox cont.today with [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up Neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-29**]. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which
   is most likely from PNA given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration.
   Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Follow up LFTs, amylase and lipase
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 10 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs, once new tube
   is placed.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure requiring intubation, hypotension, urinary tract infection (UTI), potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's current vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The respiratory support parameters indicate an increased respiratory rate and slight alkalosis. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been broadened to vancomycin antibiotics due to MRSA in the sputum.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.7 K/uL and elevated lactate levels at 1.3 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate mild alkalosis with a pH of 7.48.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse vented breath sounds, rhonchi in anterior lung fields, diminished breath sounds in the bases, and 3+ upper extremity edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on minimal vent settings. The plan is to wean vent settings as tolerated, perform daily respiratory system assessment"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of proximal aortic dissection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), altered mental status (MS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, volume overload, and ventilator dependence. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and requires moderate ventilatory support. The patient's fever is controlled with antipyretics, and they are also receiving treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, and slightly low albumin levels. The blood cultures are negative, and the urine culture shows no growth. However, the sputum culture is positive for MRSA.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 102.2°F (39°C), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/78 mmHg to 145/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient's weight is 91.9 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 92.3 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,476 mL and output of 2,357 mL, with a positive balance of 119 mL. The urine output is within normal limits at 2,257 mL. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2 of 368 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The respiratory support parameters reveal a tidal volume (Vt) of 342 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 97, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 19 cmH2O, and plateau pressure (Pplat) of 14 cmH2O.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's altered mental status (MS) has improved, but they still require close monitoring. The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and further evaluation is needed to determine if there is a neuromuscular component to their respiratory failure. The presence of MRSA in the sputum culture suggests an active infection, which needs to be addressed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Overall, the patient remains critically ill with multiple ongoing medical complications. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage their condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of proximal aortic dissection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), altered mental status, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, volume overload, and ventilator dependence. The patient presented with respiratory failure and is currently on moderate ventilatory support. She also has fever, altered mental status, hypertension, pain control issues, tachycardia, aortic dissection, CVA with left arm immobility, leukocytosis, and potential deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised despite improved oxygenation. If she does not respond to diuretics, further investigation into a neuromuscular component of respiratory failure may be necessary.
2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection. It is planned to tap the left pleural effusion since the patient has fevers. However, it is unlikely that the effusion is large enough to impact respiratory function.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which has shown improvement in terms of mental status (MS). However, she still requires close monitoring.
4. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a history of proximal aortic dissection, which can lead to serious complications such as rupture or mal"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 9 L positive for fluid status.
   - Abx broadened to Vanc + Zosyn, following cultures before adding any
   antibiotics.
   - Diurese: resuming Lasix drip with goal of -1L today, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Decrease evening dose of metoprolol as pt. becomes hypotensive at
   night, inhibiting diuresis.
   - Bedside ultrasound to eval pulmonary effusions and consider
   thoracentesis.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120 Metoprolol PO TID. Titrate up Metoprolol as
   needed to maintain SBP and use esmolol only id SBP persistently
   elevated despite metoprolol
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will f/u with Neuro if MS improves for consideration of sugery
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.  Neuro following, their recs appreciated.
   - started ASA for CVA
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol 75mg PO 6 am, 2 pm; 50 mg PO 10 pm
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-29**]. Fevers likely [**1-3**] bacteremia which
   is most likely from PNA given possible infiltrate, h/o aspiration.
   Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Follow up LFTs, amylase and lipase
   -          Consider thoracentesis for pleural effusion analysis.
   #UE DVT: Pt has UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120, esmolol prn but will try to avoid because of large fluid load.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 9 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt, Lansoprazole, bowel regimen PRN
   Dipo: Family meeting today to discuss consideration of trach & goals of
   care.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to have multiple cerebral infarcts and a thoracic aortic dissection. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/78 mmHg to 240/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse vented breath sounds and rhonchi in the anterior lung fields, which may indicate pneumonia. She also has 3+ upper extremity edema and 1+ lower extremity edema, suggesting fluid overload.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and low albumin levels. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates mild alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Imaging studies reveal pulmonary effusions, and a bedside ultrasound is planned to evaluate these findings.

The patient's medical plan includes broadening antibiotic coverage to cover MRSA, resuming diuresis with Lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance, optimizing pulmonary status before weaning off the ventilator, and maintaining blood pressure control. She is also being started on aspirin for cerebrovascular accident prevention"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - BP dropped at night again, lasix held; BP back up at 2400 and
   metoprolol 50 mg given (2 pm dose was held earlier in the day), lasix
   restarted; tachy at 5 am and metoprolol 50 mg given
   - lasix drip off & on depending on BP, unable to effectively diurese
   - PM metoprolol dose decreased.
   - discussion with husband: prefers all medical communication through
   him and not his daughter; wait on deciding about trach given only 6
   days for this intubation; wants to wait on surgery if possible until
   wife is stronger

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on
   minimal vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Daily RSBI and
   SBT with sedation holidays although will need to optimize pulmonary
   status first.  Pt is still near 9 L positive for fluid status.
   - Abx coverage limited to Vanc alone for 14 day course.
   - Diurese: resuming Lasix drip with goal of -1L today, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Bedside ultrasound to eval pulmonary effusions and consider
   thoracentesis.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely rupture of known aneurysm.
   - Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt extubated, MS
   improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP
   and use esmolol only id SBP persistently elevated despite metoprolol.
   Follow trend in BP to tailor Metoprolol accordingly.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.  Neuro following, their recs appreciated.
   - started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease
   holding briefly today for thoracentesis.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol 75mg PO 6 am, 2 pm; 50 mg PO 10 pm
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**9-30**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab.
   -          Thoracentesis for pleural effusion analysis.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Continue diuresis, goal negative 1L
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 with a goal of net diuresis as she is 9.5 liters
   positive for stay.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dipo: Ongoing discussion with family to assess possibility of trach &
   goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and has since been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates an ongoing struggle with respiratory function. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for tracheostomy if prolonged ventilation is required.

2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has been diagnosed with a thoracic aortic dissection, which is a serious and life-threatening condition. Surgical intervention may be necessary, but the patient is not considered an operative candidate at the moment. This puts her at risk of complications related to the dissection, such as rupture or organ malperfusion.

3. Cerebrovascular Accidents (CVAs): The patient has experienced multiple strokes, which can lead to neurological deficits and increased risk of future strokes.

   24 Hour Events:
   Hypotensive to 70s/40s overnight, Lasix gtt stopped, had received PM
   Metoprolol dose.  Got 2 X 250ml fluid bolus with little effect.
   Non-invasive BPs in the 120s with a-line [**Location (un) 118**] in 70s-80s, MAPs in
   mid-50s - low60s.  Improved in early morning.
   Zosyn stopped; Vanc trough in AM [**10-1**] was 28.3. AM dose was given.  PM
   dose held. Trough reordered for [**10-2**] AM.
   Thoracentesis performed, CXR okay, heparin held for procedure, then
   restarted.

   - Diurese: resuming Lasix drip with goal of -1L today, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Follow up cytology.
   - Obtain NIF
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated, MS improves
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain SBP
   and use esmolol only id SBP persistently elevated despite metoprolol.
   Follow trend in BP to tailor Metoprolol accordingly.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Obtain rpt echo to evaluate pericardial effusions.
   - Obtain PM HCT.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. LP negative for infxn. Mental
   status improving.  Neuro following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently. -
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol scaling back due to episodes of hypotension.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**10-1**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab, pleural effusion culture.
   -          Culturing blood QOD.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 9 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   - Abx coverage limited to Vanc alone for 14 day course, now on day 11.
   - Diuresis only enough to keep her net even = lasix PRN to achieve this
   goal.
   - Follow up cytology.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated, and MS improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Obtain PM HCT today at noon.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol scaling back due to episodes of hypotension.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**10-2**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab, pleural effusion culture.
   -          Culturing blood QOD
 will culture today.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 episodes of hypotension are .
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dipo: Ongoing discussion with family to assess possibility of trach &
   goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and now presents with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and thoracic aortic dissection. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension and hypertension, which are being treated with oral and IV metoprolol as needed. She has been on a 14-day course of vancomycin for antibiotic coverage and is being given Lasix PRN for diuresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on the ventilator, and weaning settings have been attempted but not tolerated yet. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilation parameters will be necessary.
2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a known aortic aneurysm that likely led to the dissection. She is not an operative candidate at the moment. Close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac enzymes is essential.
3. AMS/CVA: The patient's mental status is stable, but multifactorial causes such as infection, bacteremia, and multifocal infarcts need to be considered. Frequent neuro checks and ongoing assessment for further strokes or complications are necessary.
4. Fever: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including aortic dissection, stroke, respiratory failure, and others. She was originally intubated for poor mental status but unable to wean. The patient has been experiencing persistent fever, fluctuating blood pressure, and respiratory distress.

The patient is currently on several medications including heparin sodium, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, lansoprazole, gabapentin, synthroid, lidocaine, and asa.

Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm, fluctuating blood pressure ranging from 81/49 mmHg to 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory support mode, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and other parameters.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheterization, respiratory failure due to poor lung compliance and inability to wean off mechanical ventilation, and infection indicated by persistent fever and leukocytosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of aortic dissection, stroke, respiratory failure, and other medical conditions. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to poor mental status (MS) but unable to wean from the ventilator. The patient has been experiencing fevers, with a maximum temperature of 102.0°F (38.9°C). 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/49 mmHg to 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's weight is 97 kg, and her height is 60 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,392 mL, including 808 mL of IV fluids, 1,311 mL of total in, and 841 mL of tube feedings. The output includes 1,077 mL of total out, with 390 mL of urine output. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of being on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 395 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rate, soft abdomen, and skin changes. Neurologically, the patient responds to voice, follows commands, and is not moving her right arm.

Laboratory tests show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.9 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, low platelet count (Plt) of 104 thousand/mm3, and elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient has several medical complications including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the upper extremity, acute respiratory failure, benign hypertension, aortic dissection, and ischemic stroke. The plan includes continuing heparin for DVT, investigating the cause of daily fevers, providing respiratory support with tracheostomy likely required, managing hypertension, controlling blood pressure, and addressing the aortic dissection.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill 74-year-old woman with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, DVT, hypertension, aortic dissection, and ischemic stroke. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   diuresis.  Pt. continues to fail PSV trials.
   - Abx coverage limited to Vanc alone for 14 day course, now on day 12.
   - Diuresis only enough to keep her net even = lasix PRN to achieve this
   goal.
   - Follow up cytology of pleural fluid.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated, and MS improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Obtain PM HCT today at noon.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol scaling back due to episodes of hypotension.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**10-2**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab, pleural effusion culture.
   -          Culturing blood QOD
 will culture today.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able .
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dipo: Ongoing discussion with family to assess possibility of trach &

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute mental status changes (AMS) and later diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. She is currently intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with ABG showing mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings. The goal is to wean vent settings as tolerated, but the patient has not been able to tolerate diuresis. Antibiotic coverage has been limited to Vancomycin alone for a 14-day course, and diuretics are being used to maintain a net even fluid balance.

The patient's aortic dissection is believed to be due to dissection of a known aortic aneurysm, and she is not considered an operative candidate. If the patient is extubated and her mental status improves, a re-consultation with CT will be sought.

The patient's AMS/CVA is stable, with multifactorial causes including infection and bacteremia, as well as multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Mental status is improving, and neuro checks are being performed regularly. The patient is also being started on ASA for CVA, heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF, and upper extremity DVT.

The patient has a history of atr"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute medical conditions including respiratory failure, aortic dissection, delirium/AMS (acute mental status changes), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fever, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient was found down by her husband and diagnosed with AMS, acute CVAs (cerebrovascular accidents), and thoracic aortic dissection. She is intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on a ventilator. Her ABG (arterial blood gas) shows mild alkalosis on minimal vent settings. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, but she has not tolerated weaning off the ventilator.

The patient is on a 14-day course of vancomycin for antibiotic coverage, with limited abx coverage. Diuresis is being used to keep her net even, with lasix given as needed. Follow-up cytology is planned.

The aortic dissection is believed to be a result of dissection of a known aortic aneurysm. The patient is not an operative candidate, and re-consultation with CT is pending if the patient is extubated and mental status improves.

For AMS/CVA, the patient's mental status is stable and not explained by infarcts. It is likely multifactorial, secondary to infection and bacteremia"

   [**10-1**] - Sputum gram stain, coag+ Staph. aureus
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   diuresis.  Pt. continues to fail PSV trials.
   - Abx coverage limited to Vanc alone for 14 day course, now on day 12.
   - Diuresis only enough to keep her net even = lasix PRN to achieve this
   goal.
   - Follow up cytology of pleural fluid.
   - Wean from vent as tolerated.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated, and MS improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Hct stable; recheck before tomorrow morning only if concern for
   bleeding.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol scaling back due to episodes of hypotension.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**10-2**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.
   -          Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal
   swab, pleural effusion culture.
   -          Culturing blood QOD
 will culture today.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn. Check pm lytes
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, aortic dissection, and cerebral vascular accident. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with minimal settings. She is febrile with a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and has a history of infection, including MRSA in her sputum culture. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her upper extremity and is on heparin for anticoagulation. 

Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute and hypotension with a blood pressure of 85/52 mmHg. She has coarse bilateral breath sounds and diminished breath sounds in the bases. She has edema in her upper and lower extremities and is receiving diuretics to maintain fluid balance. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has an elevated platelet count. 

The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she is sedated with lorazepam and morphine. She has a history of delirium, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypothyroid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with respiratory failure and aortic dissection. She is currently in the ICU and has been critically ill. She has a history of fever, tachycardia, anemia, hypertension, pain control, and CVA. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 14, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 103. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.4, PaCO2 of 22 mmHg, and PaO2 of 104 mmHg. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 to 161/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with respiratory failure and aortic dissection. She is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV). She has a history of fever, hypertension, pain control, tachycardia, and anemia. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 97-126 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/60 mmHg to 161/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 97 kg, with a height of 60 inches. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,562 mL, including 666 mL of intravenous fluids, 459 mL of tube feedings, and 328 mL of oral intake. The total output was 1,572 mL, consisting of 370 mL of urine, 296 mL of drain output, and 10 mL of negative balance. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.4, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 22 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 104 mmHg. 

The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.4 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 620 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.0 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 135 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 22 mEq/L, glucose of 119 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 20 mg/dL. 

The patient has a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), fever, respiratory failure, anemia, hypertension, pain control, tachycardia, and ischemic stroke. The patient is on various medications including heparin, furosemide, metoprolol, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and lansoprazole. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), worsening anemia, further deterioration of renal function, and potential cardiac complications related to aortic dissection."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of volume overload,
   respiratory muscle weakness, infection.
   - Abx coverage limited to Vanc alone for 14 day course, now on day 13.
   Will get 1 more dose tomorrow.
   - Diuresis only enough to keep her net even = lasix PRN to achieve this
   goal.
   - Follow up cytology of pleural fluid.
   - Consider trach and g-tube given lack of ability to wean from vent and
   likely respiratory muscle weakness.  Will discuss with family today.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   Extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBCs, although unlikely to be actively bleeding at
   this time.
   - will use non-invasive BPs for monitoring of blood pressure and NOT
   a-line
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol scaling back due to episodes of hypotension.  Getting
   Metoprolol 25mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**10-2**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear
   other source of infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1
   more dose abx tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in
   sputum.
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal swab, pleural
   effusion culture.
   - Culturing blood QOD.
   - recheck TSH today
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dispo: Will discuss trach and g-tube with family.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, heparin, ASA, Tylenol, and morphine. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for MRSA, stress ulcer prevention, and deep vein thrombosis prevention.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 mmHg to 142/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. Her temperature is 101.6°F.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated lactate levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Other lab results indicate an elevated troponin T level, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and hypothyroidism. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have acute cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been on vancomycin for a suspected MRSA infection and has been receiving diuretics to manage her fluid status. The patient's blood cultures have been positive for MRSA, and she has developed a fever. She also has evidence of upper and lower extremity edema, likely due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's medical plan includes weaning off the ventilator as tolerated, continuing with lasix PRN for diuresis, and re-consulting a CT if the patient is extubated and shows improvement in her mental status. She is also being maintained on a blood pressure range of 100-120 mmHg using metoprolol and small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to manage agitation and fever effects on blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient is unable to be weaned off the ventilator, further deterioration of mental status, progression of aortic"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of volume overload,
   respiratory muscle weakness, infection.
   - Last dose of Vancomycin today for MRSA in sputum; although likely she
   is colonized.
   - Will start lasix drip to attempt diruesis today in the setting of
   hypertension
   - Consider trach and g-tube given lack of ability to wean from vent and
   likely respiratory muscle weakness.  Will discuss with family today.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess abiltity to
   breathe off vent.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   -  Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear other source of
   infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1 more dose abx
   today and no more Vancomycin tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far
   are MRSA in sputum.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Culturing blood QOD.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dispo: Will discuss trach and g-tube with family.

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial stroke (AMS/CVA), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, and multiple comorbidities. She was found down by her husband and is currently intubated and ventilated due to respiratory failure.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She is currently being treated for MRSA infection in her sputum and has a Foley catheter in place.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/83 mmHg to 157/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been started on a lasix drip for diuresis, and attempts to wean her off the ventilator have been unsuccessful so far. The family has expressed a desire to wait 24-48 hours before considering a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2-9.6 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 7.9-21.5 g/dL, platelet count of"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of volume overload,
   respiratory muscle weakness, infection.
   - Abx coverage limited to Vanc alone for 14 day course, now on day 13.
   Will get 1 more dose tomorrow.
   - Diuresis only enough to keep her net even = lasix PRN to achieve this
   goal.
   - Follow up cytology of pleural fluid.
   - Consider trach and g-tube given lack of ability to wean from vent and
   likely respiratory muscle weakness.  Will discuss with family today.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   Extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBCs, although unlikely to be actively bleeding at
   this time.
   - will use non-invasive BPs for monitoring of blood pressure and NOT
   a-line
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   - Metoprolol scaling back due to episodes of hypotension.  Getting
   Metoprolol 25mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt spiked fever again [**10-2**]. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear
   other source of infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1
   more dose abx tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in
   sputum.
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine and stool cxs, and nasal swab, pleural
   effusion culture.
   - Culturing blood QOD.
   - recheck TSH today
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute medical conditions including respiratory failure, aortic dissection, AMS/CVA, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fever, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient was found down by her husband and is now intubated due to acute respiratory failure.
- She has a history of known aortic aneurysm and is not an operative candidate for surgical repair.
- The patient's mental status has improved, but she remains ventilator-dependent.
- She has episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia consistent with atrial fibrillation with RVR.
- The patient's fever is likely due to a MRSA infection in the sputum.
- She has significant edema in her upper extremities, which is likely related to a DVT.
- Her blood pressure needs to be maintained between 100-120 mmHg.
- The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted as needed.
- She is receiving nutrition via a Dobhoff tube.
- All lines need to be considered for removal if the patient's infectious status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on the ventilator, indicating respiratory muscle weakness. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to this weakness, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Aortic Dissection"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt
   is still near 11 L positive for fluid status, however she has not been
   able to tolerate diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of
   volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible infection.
   - Stopped lasix drip due to periods of hypotension, and will attempt to
   diurese gently and as tolerated.
   - Cont. discussions with family re: trach and g-tube given lack of
   ability to wean from vent and likely respiratory muscle weakness.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess ability to
   breathe off vent.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID with holding parameters and PRN doses in
   order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   -  Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear other source of
   infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1 more dose abx
   today and no more Vancomycin tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far
   are MRSA in sputum.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Culturing blood QOD.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The patient was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and subsequently diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The failure is attributed to volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, and possible infection. The patient's ability to tolerate diuretics is still being assessed, as stopping the lasix drip resulted in periods of hypotension. 

The patient also has a history of aortic aneurysm, for which she is not an operative candidate. Therefore, the focus is on medical management to control blood pressure and mitigate the effects of agitation and fever on blood pressure. 

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and anticoagulation therapy has been initiated with heparin. 

The patient's recent fever curve appears to be improving, but low-grade fevers persist. Sputum cultures have grown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), leading to a change in antibiotic therapy. 

Furthermore, the patient has evidence of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving heparin therapy. 

Other comorbidities mentioned include hypothyroidism,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt
   is still near 11 L positive for fluid status, however she has not been
   able to tolerate diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of
   volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible infection.
   - Stopped lasix drip due to periods of hypotension, and will attempt to
   diurese gently and as tolerated.
   - Cont. discussions with family re: trach and g-tube given lack of
   ability to wean from vent and likely respiratory muscle weakness.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess ability to
   breathe off vent.
   - Obtain another NIF and trail on PS.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID with holding parameters and PRN doses in
   order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   - Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear other source of
   infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1 more dose abx
   today and no more Vancomycin tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far
   are MRSA in sputum.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider sinus CT and/or RUQ u/s if no information from above
   studies.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs. Will try to place NGT in order to prevent sinusitis.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dispo: Will discuss trach and g-tube with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute medical and neurological issues. She was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and later diagnosed with multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. The patient is currently intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. She has volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, and possible infection. The patient's fever curve appears to be improving, but she still has low-grade fevers. Sputum cultures have grown Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin was stopped after the last dose. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypothyroidism, hypertension, and possible upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still near 11 L positive for fluid status, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. She has not been able to tolerate diuresis due to periods of hypotension. Continued efforts will be made to wean vent settings to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to assess her ability to breathe off the ventilator.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and positive sputum culture for MRSA suggest an ongoing infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt
   is still near 11 L positive for fluid status, however she has not been
   able to tolerate diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of
   volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible infection.
   - Stopped lasix drip due to periods of hypotension, and will attempt to
   diurese gently and as tolerated.
   - Cont. discussions with family re: trach and g-tube given lack of
   ability to wean from vent and likely respiratory muscle weakness.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess ability to
   breathe off vent.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID with holding parameters and PRN doses in
   order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   - Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear other source of
   infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1 more dose abx
   today and no more Vancomycin tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far
   are MRSA in sputum.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dispo: Will discuss trach and g-tube with family.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. ABG with mild alkalosis on minimal
   vent settings.  Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L
   positive for fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate
   diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of volume overload,
   respiratory muscle weakness, infection.
   - Last dose of Vancomycin today for MRSA in sputum; although likely she
   is colonized.
   - Will start lasix drip to attempt diruesis today in the setting of
   hypertension
   - Consider trach and g-tube given lack of ability to wean from vent and
   likely respiratory muscle weakness.  Will discuss with family today.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess abiltity to
   breathe off vent.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Titrate up Metoprolol as needed to maintain
   SBP, using small amounts of morphine and Tylenol to agitation and fever
   effects on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. re-intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status improving.  Neuro
   following, their recs appreciated.
   - Started ASA for CVA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease,
   PAF and upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair
   -  Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear other source of
   infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1 more dose abx
   today and no more Vancomycin tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far
   are MRSA in sputum.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Culturing blood QOD.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   -          Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  History of
   abnormal nuclear stress testing.  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dispo: Will discuss trach and g-tube with family.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Failure is mulitfactorial in the
   setting of volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible
   infection.  Neuromuscular weakness is likely myopathy/neuropathy of
   critical illness, much less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**], GBS, other
   myopathy.  Re: infection, the patient has positive sputum cx, but has
   already received appropriate antibiotics, and does not have worsening
   infiltrate
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L positive for
   fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate diuresis.  Hold
   Lasix for procedure, re-evaluate post-procedure
   Contact neuromuscular fellow re: patient with low NIF
   -IP today for Trach/peg
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.
   Finished Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If
   still positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs
   (gabapentin), thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection,
   cholecystitis.  Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood
   cx.
   -repeat amylase, lipase, LFTs
   -RUQ u/s if elevated Alk phos persists.
   -d/c neurontin
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider sinus CT and/or RUQ u/s if no information from above
   studies.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID with holding parameters and PRN doses in
   order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   - Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   -Hold metoprolol for tracheostomy in anticipation of sedation induced
   hypotension, but write for metoprolol 5 mg IV prn peri-operatively if
   patient requires BP control.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs. Will try to place NGT in order to prevent sinusitis.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has a history of acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. She has positive sputum cultures for MRSA and has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin. She is febrile with low-grade fevers, and further cultures are pending. The patient has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremities. She is also being treated for hypothyroidism and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to multiple factors including volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible infection, and neuromuscular weakness. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and diuresis has not been tolerated so far.
2. Infection: The patient has positive sputum cultures for MRSA, and her fever curve appears to be improving. However, she still has low-grade fevers, and additional cultures are pending. There is a concern for ongoing infection, and if the fever persists, further investigation is needed.
3. Aortic Dissection:"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Failure is mulitfactorial in the
   setting of volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible
   infection.  Neuromuscular weakness is likely myopathy/neuropathy of
   critical illness, much less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**], GBS, other
   myopathy.  Re: infection, the patient has positive sputum cx, but has
   already received appropriate antibiotics, and does not have worsening
   infiltrate
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L positive for
   fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate diuresis.  Hold
   Lasix for procedure, re-evaluate post-procedure
   Contact neuromuscular fellow re: patient with low NIF
   -IP today for Trach/peg
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.
   Finished Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If
   still positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs
   (gabapentin), thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection,
   cholecystitis.  Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood
   cx.
   -repeat amylase, lipase, LFTs
   -RUQ u/s if elevated Alk phos persists.
   -d/c neurontin
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider sinus CT if fever persists after trach and peg.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 25 mg PO qAM and qPM, 50 mg PO at 2PM with holding
   parameters and PRN doses in order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   -hold 2 PM dose for surgery, with order for metoprolol IV
   peri-operatively if needd.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   -Hold metoprolol for tracheostomy in anticipation of sedation induced
   hypotension, but write for metoprolol 5 mg IV prn peri-operatively if
   patient requires BP control.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - holding heparin peri-op, will restart afterwards.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: NGT placed, may be d/c
d following trach and PEG.  Feeds through
   tube following surgery.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She was found down with altered mental status and later diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and thoracic aortic dissection. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. The patient has positive sputum cultures for GPC clusters and chains, and her fever curve appears to be improving, although she still has low-grade fevers. She has received appropriate antibiotics but does not have worsening infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's mental status continues to improve, and she is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. She is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. She also has upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving heparin therapy. Her blood pressure needs to be maintained between 100-120 mmHg using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine, and Tylenol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may continue if she is unable to tolerate weaning off the ventilator.
2. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient's sputum culture remains positive for"

   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt
   is still near 11 L positive for fluid status, however she has not been
   able to tolerate diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of
   volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible infection.
   - Stopped lasix drip due to periods of hypotension, and will attempt to
   diurese gently and as tolerated.
   - Cont. discussions with family re: trach and g-tube given lack of
   ability to wean from vent and likely respiratory muscle weakness.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess ability to
   breathe off vent.
   - Obtain another NIF and trail on PS.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID with holding parameters and PRN doses in
   order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs

   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   - Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Sputum cx growing MRSA.  Unclear other source of
   infection.  Possibly related to Vancomycin.  Will get 1 more dose abx
   today and no more Vancomycin tomorrow.  Only cultures positive thus far
   are MRSA in sputum.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider sinus CT and/or RUQ u/s if no information from above
   studies.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt
   is still near 11 L positive for fluid status, however she has not been
   able to tolerate diuresis.  Failure is mulitfactorial in the setting of
   volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible infection.
   - Stopped lasix drip due to periods of hypotension, and will attempt to
   diurese gently and as tolerated.
   - Cont. discussions with family re: trach and g-tube given lack of
   ability to wean from vent and likely respiratory muscle weakness.
   - Will attempt to wean vent settings to SBT today to assess ability to
   breathe off vent.
   - Obtain another NIF and trail on PS.
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.
   Finished Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If
   still positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection, cholecystitis.  Joint
   infection less likely.
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider sinus CT and/or RUQ u/s if no information from above
   studies.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 37.5mg PO TID with holding parameters and PRN doses in
   order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   - Getting Metoprolol 37.5 mg TID as tolerated by BP.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - Using Heparin gtt, holding off from coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Dubhoff replaced [**10-3**]; Cont. tubefeeds via Dobhoff tube per
   nutrition recs. Will try to place NGT in order to prevent sinusitis.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), Lansoprazole,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Dispo: Will discuss trach and g-tube with family.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Failure is mulitfactorial in the
   setting of volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible
   infection.  Neuromuscular weakness is likely myopathy/neuropathy of
   critical illness, much less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**], GBS, other
   myopathy.  Re: infection, the patient has positive sputum cx, but has
   already received appropriate antibiotics, and does not have worsening
   infiltrate
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L positive for
   fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate diuresis.  Hold
   Lasix for procedure, re-evaluate post-procedure
   Contact neuromuscular fellow re: patient with low NIF
   -IP today for Trach/peg
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.
   Finished Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If
   still positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs
   (gabapentin), thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection,
   cholecystitis.  Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood
   cx.
   -repeat amylase, lipase, LFTs
   -RUQ u/s if elevated Alk phos persists.
   -d/c neurontin
   - Obtain new sputum culture, LFTs, CBC w/ diff, CXR (consider
   thoracentesis if effusions have reaccumulated).
   - Consider sinus CT if fever persists after trach and peg.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol is 25 mg PO qAM and qPM, 50 mg PO at 2PM with holding
   parameters and PRN doses in order to control breakthrough hypertension.
   -hold 2 PM dose for surgery, with order for metoprolol IV
   peri-operatively if needd.
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   -Hold metoprolol for tracheostomy in anticipation of sedation induced
   hypotension, but write for metoprolol 5 mg IV prn peri-operatively if
   patient requires BP control.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - holding heparin peri-op, will restart afterwards.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: NGT placed, may be d/c
d following trach and PEG.  Feeds through
   tube following surgery.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt (holding for procedure), bowel regimen
   PRN
   -Lansoprazole switched to ranitidine 150 mg PO q daily (dose decreased
   [**1-3**] advanced age)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute myeloid syndrome (AMS) by her husband. She has since experienced multiple complications, including acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, fever, and others. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on the ventilator due to respiratory muscle weakness and possible infection. Weaning of vent settings may be challenging due to fluid overload.

2. Fever: Although the patient's fever curve appears to be improving, low-grade fevers persist. The only positive culture so far is MRSA in sputum. It is important to continue monitoring and follow-up with cultures.

3. Aortic Dissection: The etiology of the dissection is likely dissection of a known aortic aneurysm. The patient is not an operative candidate at this time. Re-consultation with CT is recommended if the patient's clinical status improves and she is extubated.

4. AMS/CVA: The patient's mental status continues to improve, but she remains intubated and vent-dependent. Strokes were identified in the pons. ASA and heparin have been started for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

5. UE DVT: The patient"

   - pt to have EMG early next week for respiratory muscle weakness
   -IP today for Trach/peg
   #Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including acute cardiovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, fever, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation due to her respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. She also has upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors such as volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, and possible infection. If not properly managed, the patient may experience further deterioration in her respiratory function, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

2. Aortic Dissection: The patient has been diagnosed with a thoracic aortic dissection, which is a serious condition that requires close monitoring. If the dissection progresses or if there are complications such as rupture, it can lead to life-threatening bleeding and cardiovascular collapse.

3. UTI: The patient has a positive sputum culture indicating a possible UTI. If left untreated or inadequately treated, the infection can worsen,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated. Failure is mulitfactorial in the
   setting of volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, possible
   infection.  Neuromuscular weakness is likely myopathy/neuropathy of
   critical illness, much less likely myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 1209**], GBS, other
   myopathy.  Re: infection, the patient has positive sputum cx, but has
   already received appropriate antibiotics, and does not have worsening
   infiltrate.
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated, Pt is still near 11 L positive for
   fluid status, however she has not been able to tolerate diuresis.  Hold
   Lasix for procedure, re-evaluate post-procedure
   - pt to have EMG early next week for respiratory muscle weakness
   -IP today for Trach/peg
   # Fever: Pt
s fever curve appears to be improving although still having
   low-grade fevers. Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.
   Finished Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If
   still positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection, cholecystitis.  Joint
   infection less likely, given absence of blood cx.
   - neurontin stopped
   - f/u cultures
   - continue to trend
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate. Will re-consult CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] if pt
   extubated and clinical status improves.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO BID for now
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
 consider EEG once infection resolves.
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, no Coumadin for now pending consideration of
   potential aortic dissection repair, and other procedures including
   tracheostomy and PEG.
   #UE DVT: UE>LE edema, likely [**1-3**] to DVT.
   - holding heparin peri-op, will restart afterwards.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.  Per OMR on Cartia XT.
   - Will continue Enalapril and PO metoprolol to achieve a goal SBP
   100-120.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - IV Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremities, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. The patient was found down by her husband and presented with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection.

The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial in nature. There is volume overload, respiratory muscle weakness, and possible infection. The patient has a positive sputum culture for MRSA but has completed a 14-day course of vancomycin. Fever curve appears to be improving.

The patient's mental status is improving, and she is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned once the infection resolves. The patient is also onASA and heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, including pulmonary embolism and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.

The patient has a history of aortic aneurysm, and the aortic dissection is likely due to dissection of the known aneurysm. She is not an operative candidate, so conservative management will be continued. Metoprolol, small amounts of morphine, and Tylenol are being used to mitigate the effects of agitation and fever on blood"

   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now with tracheotomy without complications.
   Continues to require ventilatory support.  Possible muscle weakness
   given failed NIFs (-16).  Also has L pleural effusion which is
   contributing but not worsening.

   - pt to have EMG early next week for respiratory muscle weakness per
   neuromuscular fellow
   # Fever: Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.  Finished
   Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If still
   positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection although abdomen is benign.
   Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood cx.

   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will restart Metoprolol PO when able to take POs
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, consider Coumadin in future

","The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute mental status changes (AMS) by her husband. She has a history of acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and thoracic aortic dissection. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements yesterday. She is currently on ventilatory support and has a fever of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 136/81 to 154/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The physical examination reveals the patient to be trached, with opening eyes to voice and following simple commands. She has coarse ventilator breath sounds bilaterally, with diminished breath sounds in the bases. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient also has elevated levels of liver enzymes and electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, fever, aortic dissection, AMS/CVA, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of coronary artery disease ("

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now with tracheotomy without complications.
   Continues to require ventilatory support.  Possible muscle weakness
   given failed NIFs (-16).  Also has L pleural effusion which is
   contributing but not worsening.
   - restart lasix gtt for diuresis with goal -500 to -1L
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - pt to have EMG early next week for respiratory muscle weakness per
   neuromuscular fellow
   # Fever: Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.  Finished
   Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If still
   positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection although abdomen is benign.
   Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood cx.
   - neurontin stopped
   - f/u cultures
   - continue to trend
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will restart Metoprolol PO when able to take POs
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, consider Coumadin in future
   #UE DVT: confirmed on U/S.
   - heparin gtt, consider starting Coumadin
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - continue current dose of Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even or
   negative.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: restart tube feeds 24 hours post PEG placement
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt, bowel regimen PRN, Ranitidine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with acute mental status changes (AMS) by her husband. She has a history of multiple comorbidities including acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure, fever, aortic aneurysm, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypertension (HTN), hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient underwent a tracheotomy without complications and continues to require ventilatory support. She also has a left pleural effusion. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support due to muscle weakness, possibly caused by failed noninvasive ventilation (NIFs). A lung pleural effusion is contributing but not worsening the respiratory failure.
2. Fever: The patient had a positive MRSA sputum culture. She completed a 14-day course of Vancomycin. Cultures are still being followed. If still positive, the patient may be colonized, and fevers could be caused by [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs, thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection (although the abdomen is benign), or joint infection (less likely without blood cultures).
3. Aortic Dissection: The patient likely dissected her known aortic"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection; subsequently developed right UE DVT, and
   underwent procedures for a tracheostomy and PEG placement.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now with tracheotomy without complications.
   Continues to require ventilatory support.  Possible muscle weakness
   given failed NIFs (-16).  Also has L pleural effusion which may be
   contributing but not worsening.
   - Restart lasix gtt for diuresis with goal -500 to -1L
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated.
   - Pt to have EMG early next week for respiratory muscle weakness per
   neuromuscular fellow.
   # Fever: Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.  Finished
   Vancomycin 14 day course. If still positive, may be colonized, and
   fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs, thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection
   although abdomen is benign.  Joint infection less likely, given absence
   of blood cx.
   - Cultures continue to grow MRSA
 given that pt is afebrile, with a
   WBC count that is trending down, MRSA may represent colonization rather
   than a pathogen.
   - F/u cultures that are pending.
   - Continue to trend fevers and WBCs.
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not an operative candidate.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using Metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - Will restart Metoprolol PO when able to take POs
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT
 Will start coumadin today at 5mg bolus.  Will
   follow PT/INR daily, starting tomorrow.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan and Morphine to mildly sedate pt due to
   intubation and discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, consider Coumadin in future
   #UE DVT: confirmed on U/S.
   - heparin gtt, starting Coumadin
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO BID

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and subsequently diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and thoracic aortic dissection. She underwent procedures for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient continues to require ventilatory support and has a left pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient still requires ventilatory support, which indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Muscle weakness is suspected, and an electromyography (EMG) is planned to assess respiratory muscle weakness.

2. Fever: The patient had a positive culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the sputum, but she is now afebrile. This suggests that MRSA may represent colonization rather than a pathogen. However, further cultures are pending, and the patient will be monitored for any signs of infection.

3. Aortic dissection: The patient has a known aortic aneurysm, and the dissection is likely due to this. The patient is not an operative candidate, and blood pressure management is crucial to prevent further complications.

4. AMS/CVA: The patient's mental status remains stable, and multifactorial causes such as infection and bacteremia, as well as multifocal infarcts and a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) and later diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a type A thoracic aortic dissection. She underwent tracheotomy without complications and continues to require ventilatory support. The patient has a history of abdominal pain following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and diffuse tactile purpura (TTP). She also has lower extremity edema and positive blood cultures for MRSA. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. Her respiratory function is compromised, and she requires assistance with breathing. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and depression. The patient's current plan includes weaning off ventilator support, restarting tube feeds, monitoring urine output, and managing electrolyte levels. The patient is on multiple medications including metoprolol, morphine, Tylenol, ranitidine, heparin, and Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support, indicating a potential for respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures for MRSA suggest an ongoing infection, which may lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now with tracheotomy without complications.
   Continues to require ventilatory support.  Possible muscle weakness
   given failed NIFs (-16).  Also has L pleural effusion which is
   contributing but not worsening.
   - restart lasix gtt for diuresis with goal -500 to -1L
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - pt to have EMG early next week for respiratory muscle weakness per
   neuromuscular fellow
   # Fever: Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.  Finished
   Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If still
   positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection although abdomen is benign.
   Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood cx.
   - neurontin stopped
   - f/u cultures
   - continue to trend
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will restart Metoprolol PO when able to take POs
   # AMS/CVA: Stable. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT.
   - Follow-up neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - Started Heparin gtt, consider Coumadin in future
   #UE DVT: confirmed on U/S.
   - heparin gtt, consider starting Coumadin
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - continue current dose of Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status (AMS) by her husband and subsequently diagnosed with acute cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and a thoracic aortic dissection. She underwent a tracheotomy without complications and continues to require ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. Other issues include fever, a positive MRSA sputum culture, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive MRSA sputum culture indicate an ongoing infection. If not appropriately managed, it could lead to sepsis or a systemic infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests an increased risk of respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to her respiratory muscle weakness.
3. Thromboembolism: The patient has an upper extremity DVT and AFib with RVR, both of which increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Aortic dissection complications: Given the patient's known aortic aneurysm and subsequent dissection, there is a risk of further complications such as rupture or uncontrolled bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and type A
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Respiratory Failure: Now with tracheotomy without complications.
   Continues to require ventilatory support.  Possible muscle weakness
   given failed NIFs (-16).  Also has L pleural effusion which is
   contributing but not worsening.
   - restart lasix gtt for diuresis with goal -500 to -1L
   -Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - pt to have EMG today for respiratory muscle weakness per
   neuromuscular fellow
   # Fever: Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.  Finished
   Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If still
   positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection although abdomen is benign.
   Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood cx.
   - neurontin stopped
   - f/u cultures
   - continue to trend
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will restart Metoprolol PO when able to take POs
   # AMS/CVA: Improved. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT, now transitioning to coumadin
   - Follow-up neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - On Heparin gtt, transitioning to Coumadin.
   #UE DVT: confirmed on U/S.
   On Heparin gtt, transitioning to Coumadin.
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH would be altered in setting of acute illness; elevated today and
   will check free T4
   - continue current dose of Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -  On Metoprolol and ASA.
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even or
   negative.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: restart tube feeds 24 hours post PEG placement
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.
   Prophylaxis: SCDs, heparin gtt, bowel regimen PRN, Ranitidine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute medical events including multiple strokes, type A thoracic aortic dissection, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, fever with positive MRSA sputum culture, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and possible coronary artery disease.

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments including tracheotomy, transition from heparin to coumadin for anticoagulation, weaning of ventilatory support as tolerated, restarting of lasix for diuresis, and discontinuation of neurontin.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The presence of coarse vented bilateral breath sounds and diminished breath sounds in the bases suggests underlying lung pathology, which could lead to further respiratory compromise.

2. Infection: The patient has had positive MRSA sputum cultures, indicating a possible respiratory tract infection. The presence of fever and colonization with MRSA suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing a healthcare-associated infection.

3. Thromboembolism: The patient has an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and transitioning to coumadin. This indicates a risk of thromboembolic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of non-operable aortic dissection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and prolonged hospital course complicated by recurrent ventilatory-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is in continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode and will be transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today, with favorable pulmonary mechanics. An electroencephalogram (EMG) study is to be checked.

2. Ventilatory Associated Pneumonia: Antibiotics will continue, and follow-up cultures will be maintained.

3. Aortic Dissection: Blood pressure control will be continued, and Lopressor will continue as well.

4. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): Coumadin has been started, and heparin will be discontinued when therapeutic levels are achieved. Both upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and lower extremity DVT will be treated with anticoagulation.

Other Issues:

1. Ineffective coping.
2. Impaired aerobic capacity/endurance.
3. Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition.
4. Impaired balance.
5. Impaired muscle performance.
6. Impaired motor function.
7. Impaired transfers.

   74 yo F, found down with AMS by husband, now with acute CVAs and type A
   thoracic aortic dissection.
   # Abdominal Pain: Patient 2d s/p PEG placement, now w/abdominal pain
   and diffuse TTP.
   -          Check KUB
   -          LFTs, amylase, lipase
   -          Lactate
   # Respiratory Failure: Now with tracheotomy without complications.
   Continues to require ventilatory support.  Possible muscle weakness
   given failed NIFs (-16).  Also has L pleural effusion which is
   contributing but not worsening.
   - restart lasix gtt for diuresis with goal -500 to -1L
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - pt to have EMG today for respiratory muscle weakness per
   neuromuscular fellow
   # Fever: Only cultures positive thus far are MRSA in sputum.  Finished
   Vancomycin 14 day course.  - Continue to follow cultures.  If still
   positive, may be colonized, and fevers [**1-3**] sinuses, drugs,
   thromboembolism, CVA, abdominal collection although abdomen is benign.
   Joint infection less likely, given absence of blood cx.
   - blood cultures positive for G+ cocci
 to consider re-start
   Vancomycin
   - continue to follow sensitivities
   # Aortic Dissection: Etiology likely dissection of known aortic
   aneurysm. Not operative candidate.
   - Maintain SBP 100-120. Using metoprolol, small amounts of morphine and
   Tylenol to mitigate effects of agitation and fever on BP.
   - Q4H Neuro checks as able
   - will restart Metoprolol PO when able to take POs
   # AMS/CVA: Improved. Per neuro, AMS not explained by infarcts. Most
   likely multifactorial secondary to infection and bacteremia as well as
   multifocal infarcts and aortic dissection. Pt. intubated for imaging
   studies and remains vent dependent. Mental status continues to
   improve.  Strokes were in pons
   - Started ASA + heparin for potential thromboembolic disease, PAF and
   upper extremity DVT, now transitioning to coumadin
   - Follow-up neuro recs
   - Use small doses of Ativan to mildly sedate pt due to intubation and
   discomfort.
   # Afib with RVR: Pt has had episodes of uncontrolled tachycardia
   consistent with Afib with RVR but none recently.
   - On Heparin gtt, transitioning to Coumadin.
   #RUE DVT: confirmed on U/S.
   -          On Heparin gtt, transitioning to Coumadin
   -          Re-check coags in am
   # HTN: Unclear level of control as outpatient.
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: On Levoxyl as an outpatient.  Will continue with
   regular dosing.
   - TSH elevated, free T4 low
   - increase dose of Levoxyl
   # CAD: With unclear history.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1829**].  Hx of abnl
   nuclear stress testing.
   -          On Metoprolol and ASA.
   # Depression: Patient expressing wish to die to some team members, has
   depressed affect
   -          social work consult
   F: Monitor UOP
 diurese as able, try to maintain at least net even or
   negative.
   E: Replete lytes prn.
   N: Tube feeds restarted.
   Access:  A line placed, pt has midline LUE
 if infectious status
   changes, will consider pulling all lines.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of acute medical conditions including AMS (altered mental status), CVAs (cerebrovascular accidents), type A thoracic aortic dissection, abdominal pain, respiratory failure, fever, and others. The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments, and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Dissection: The patient has a known aortic aneurysm that may have led to dissection. This condition is serious and requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator will be crucial to assess the patient's progress.
3. Infection: The patient has had positive cultures for MRSA in the sputum, indicating a possible respiratory infection. Additionally, blood cultures positive for G+ cocci suggest a possible bloodstream infection. Antibiotic therapy needs to be tailored according to culture sensitivities.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has confirmed DVT in the right upper extremity. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin or Coumadin is necessary to prevent further clot formation and potential pulmonary embolism.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TSH and low free T4 levels, indicating hypothyroidism. Regular dosing of Levoxyl is essential to manage this condition.
6. Depression: The patient has expressed wishes to die and displays a depressed affect, suggesting the need for a social work consult and appropriate psychological support.
7. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) and hypertension, both of which require ongoing management with appropriate medications.
8. Potential Muscle Weakness: The patient's failed NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) trials and L (left) pleural effusion suggest possible respiratory muscle weakness. An EMG (electromyography) has been ordered to assess this further.
9. Other Complications: The patient also has leukocytosis, acute pain, chronic pain, and potential complications related to the tracheotomy site and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary to make accurate diagnoses and determine the best course of treatment for the patient."
