","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a significant medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was successfully resuscitated, intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition is stable with controlled vital signs, improved oxygenation, and adequate urine output. However, she continues to have a wide complex rhythm with a regular, junctional rate and morphology consistent with right bundle branch block (RBBB). There is a concern for possible abdominal process such as cholangitis or mesenteric ischemia, which may require further investigation with imaging studies. The patient's renal function has deteriorated since admission, with an increase in baseline creatinine from 1.0 to 2.0. Leukocytosis is present with a white blood cell count of 20.0, possibly due to the stress of cardiac arrest and epinephrine administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm/PEA: The patient's chronic history of AF and recent cardiac arrest raise concerns for potential cardiac events, including arrhythmias or myocardial infarction (MI). Continuous cardiac monitoring and repeat labs tonight are recommended to monitor potassium levels and rule out any underlying metabolic abnormalities.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, potentially due to seps"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). She presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which required resuscitation.
- She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition improved, and she was extubated.
- She has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is on carvedilol and lasix for blood pressure control. Her blood pressure is currently lower than usual.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0, which could be due to stress or infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
- She has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.0, which improved from 2.0 on presentation.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and her electrolytes are mostly within normal range.
- She has a history of CABG surgery in [**2116**].
- The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to constipation. Cultures have been obtained, and a CT scan of the torso is pending.
- Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been initiated.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she will be admitted to the CCU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's previous cardiac arrest could recur if there are underlying cardiac issues such as arrhythmias or ischemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia. It is unclear, and further investigation is needed.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia could be due to lung infiltrates, cardiomegaly, or a coin lesion in the right lower lobe. Further evaluation is necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if there are ongoing renal insults or if the initial cause is not addressed.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring and appropriate management are required.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's chronic AF could lead to thromboembolic events if not adequately anticoagulated.
8. Abdominal Pain: Although the patient's abdominal pain is currently attributed to constipation, further evaluation is needed to rule out other serious pathologies.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes, particularly potassium, need close monitoring and management to prevent complications.
10. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and antibiotics indicate a possible infection. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent sepsis.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and is now extubated and off pressors. The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and is on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 102 beats per minute with wide complex rhythm consistent with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure of 136/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally in the lungs, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and no extremity edema or femoral bruits. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (20.1 K/uL), elevated troponin T levels (>0.01 ng/mL), and elevated lactate acid levels (2.4 mmol/L).

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, hypoxia, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, and potential coronary artery disease. The plan includes monitoring cardiac enzymes, considering a permanent pacemaker, repeating labs, and monitoring potassium levels. Imaging studies such as a CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis are also planned to rule out thrombotic events or aneurysms.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, hyperkalemia, and further cardiac events."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and previous CABG surgery. She presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she was resuscitated and intubated. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving pressors.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate in the 100s with wide complex RBBB morphology, blood pressure ranging from 136/61 mmHg to 92/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her urine output initially was low but has picked up to 150-200 cc/hr after the administration of lasix.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 20.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 12.3 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 40.1%, platelet count (Plt) at 168 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 38.5 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.8 mg/dL, troponin-T at <0.01 ng/mL, and liver function tests showing elevated levels of ALT and AST.

The patient has been diagnosed with cholangitis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease and chronic atrial fibrillation. She presented with abdominal pain and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple ongoing concerns.

24-hour events:
- Extubated and off pressors
- Stopped IV fluids after extubation
- Initially had low urine output, then increased to 150-200 cc/hr
- Given a single dose of lasix
- Developed a new rhythm, possibly regular junctional with wide complex right bundle branch block morphology and unclear P waves
- Has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on coumadin at home. Coumadin was held today due to the possibility of an upcoming procedure, and heparin subcutaneous was started because of the question of an abdominal process and nearly therapeutic INR
- Experiences left leg pain this morning but no abdominal pain

Assessment and plan:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and presented with abdominal pain, progressing to PEA arrest. She was resuscitated and now requires ICU care.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely due to a thrombotic event such as pulmonary embolism, abdominal aortic aneurysm, myocard"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had small bowel movement early afternoon yesterday.  Up to
   commode 2 times after that with a lot of straining causing her external
   hemorrhoid to bleed twice.  Still on 5 Liters nasal cannula at 1AM. Put
   out 2 Liters today but still positive 1.3 Liters for length of stay.
   Given another 20mg IV Lasix over night. Changed Zosyn to levofloxacin
   750mg PO this AM, metronidazole to PO as well. Started warfarin,
   started bowel regimen.  Cordis d/c
   -ECHO [**10-8**] at 3.20pm: The right + left atrium are moderately dilated.
   Right + Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal, free wall motion is
   normal (LVEF 60-70%).
   -The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   -Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral + Tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery. She presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she was resuscitated and intubated. 

The patient has been extubated and is now on a nasal cannula for oxygen supplementation. She has been experiencing cough with clear sputum, suggesting possible pneumonia or sinusitis. 

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis), elevated creatinine levels initially but now back to baseline, and elevated troponin-T levels. Her potassium level is also elevated. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/66 to 141/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with a paced rhythm. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and potential coronary artery disease. She has a history of hypertension and CAD with previous CABG surgery. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, acidosis, hyperkalemia, pneumonia, aortic dissection, and acute renal failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The patient presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and temporarily paced due to atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient has been extubated and is off pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rhythm/PEA: The patient's chronic history of AFib and recent PEA arrest indicate a potential for recurrent arrhythmias or cardiac events. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram (EKG) and consideration of a permanent pacemaker may be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's unclear etiology of hypotension could potentially be due to sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia. Monitoring potassium levels and conducting appropriate diagnostic tests such as a CT chest and abdominal imaging would help identify the underlying cause.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be attributed to a lung infection, cardiomegaly, or a coin lesion in the right lower lobe. Chest X-ray findings suggest possible pneumonia or other pulmonary issues. Further evaluation with a CT chest and management with antibiotics and diuretics may be required.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1."

   -ECHO [**10-8**] at 3.20pm: The right + left atrium are moderately dilated.
   Right + Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal, free wall motion is
   normal (LVEF 60-70%).
   -The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   -Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral + Tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent abdominal pain. She presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she was resuscitated and transferred to the CCU. The patient has a chronic history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on anticoagulation therapy. She experienced an episode of bradycardia in the emergency department (ED) and has been tachycardic since admission to the CCU. The patient's current medications include carvedilol, lasix, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and warfarin. She is also on bowel regimen and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the cause is unclear. It could be due to sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia. Monitoring of blood pressure and electrolyte levels is necessary.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently experiencing hypoxia. This could be caused by an infection, fluid accumulation in the lungs, or other respiratory issues. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray and oxygen therapy may be required.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.0,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had small bowel movement early afternoon yesterday.  Up to
   commode 2 times after that with a lot of straining causing her external
   hemorrhoid to bleed twice.  Still on 5 Liters nasal cannula at 1AM. Put
   out 2 Liters today but still positive 1.3 Liters for length of stay.
   Given another 20mg IV Lasix over night. Changed Zosyn to levofloxacin
   750mg PO this AM, metronidazole to PO as well. Started warfarin,
   started bowel regimen.  Cordis d/c
   -ECHO [**10-8**] at 3.20pm: The right + left atrium are moderately dilated.
   Right + Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal, free wall motion is
   normal (LVEF 60-70%).
   -The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   -Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral + Tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   -Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, who presented with abdominal pain and experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and temporarily paced due to bradycardia. The patient has been extubated and is now off pressors. She has a history of cardiac catheterization and CABG in 2016. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable but there is a concern for unclear etiology of hypotension. Possible causes include sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia. Monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the cause.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has a decreased oxygen saturation level, indicating potential hypoxia. This could be due to the presence of crackles on lung examination, infiltrates on chest X-ray, cardiomegaly, or a coin lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung. Treatment includes administering Lasix IV and extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and transferred to the critical care unit (CCU). The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a temporary pacer wire in place. Vital signs include a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 39 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.7°C. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. An echocardiogram reveals moderate aortic regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, as well as mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has an unclear etiology of hypotension, which could potentially be due to sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, as indicated by a low oxygen saturation level on the nasal cannula. This may be caused by a lung infection or other respiratory issues.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.0, but it increased to 2.0"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had small bowel movement early this afternoon.  Up to commode 2
   times after that with a lot of straining causing her external
   hemorrhoid to bleed twice.  Still on 5 Liters nasal cannula at 1AM. Put
   out 2 Liters today but still positive 1.3 Liters for length of stay.
   Given another 20mg IV Lasix over night. Changed Zosyn to levofloxacin
   PO this AM, metronidazole to PO as well. Started warfarin, started
   bowel regimen.  Cordis d/c
   -ECHO: The right + left atrium are moderately dilated. Right + Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal, free wall motion is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
   -The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   -Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral + Tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   -Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**1-5**] v2008, probably no major change.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was successfully resuscitated, extubated, and taken to the cardiac care unit (CCU). 

The patient has a chronic history of atrial fibrillation (on anticoagulation) and experienced a temporary pacer wire placement due to an episode of asystole while in the emergency department (ED). Her current rhythm is paced with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm).

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Rhythm/PEA: The patient's current paced rhythm and previous episode of PEA suggest the possibility of another cardiac event. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the underlying cause and prevent future episodes.

2. Hypotension: The patient's unclear etiology of hypotension may be due to sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are needed to manage this condition.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) indicates possible hypoxia. A chest X-ray revealed LLL infiltrate, cardiomegaly, and a coin lesion in the RLL, along with crackles on examination. These findings suggest a respiratory issue, possibly pneumonia or pulmonary edema."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with abdominal pain and progressing to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was resuscitated, extubated, and taken off pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rhythm/PEA: The patient has a chronic history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is on anticoagulation. She became asystolic while in the emergency department (ED) and was successfully resuscitated. The possible causes for this episode include pulmonary embolism (PE), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), myocardial infarction (MI), mesenteric ischemia, metabolic abnormalities, hypoxia, medication overdose, or acidosis.

2. Hypotension: The etiology of hypotension is unclear, with potential causes including sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia.

3. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of hypoxia, which could be due to pneumonia, as indicated by a chest X-ray showing left lower lobe infiltrate, cardiomegaly, and a coin lesion in the right lower lobe. Crackles on examination also suggest the presence of pulmonary edema or fluid in the lungs.

4. Cough: The patient reports a new onset cough, which could be due to pneumonia,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had small bowel movement early afternoon yesterday.  Up to
   commode 2 times after that with a lot of straining causing her external
   hemorrhoid to bleed twice.  Still on 5 Liters nasal cannula at 1AM. Put
   out 2 Liters today but still positive 1.3 Liters for length of stay.
   Given another 20mg IV Lasix over night. Changed Zosyn to levofloxacin
   750mg PO this AM, metronidazole to PO as well. Started warfarin,
   started bowel regimen.  Cordis d/c
   -ECHO [**10-8**] at 3.20pm: The right + left atrium are moderately dilated.
   Right + Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal, free wall motion is
   normal (LVEF 60-70%).
   -The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   -Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mitral + Tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous CABG surgery. The patient presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, was resuscitated, extubated, and is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient had an episode of hypotension that resolved. The cause is unclear but could be due to sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia as indicated by a SpO2 of 93% on a nasal cannula. There is a LLL infiltrate on the chest X-ray, cardiomegaly, and a coin lesion in the RLL, along with crackles on examination.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.0, which improved from 2.0 on presentation. This indicates a possible recovery from acute renal failure.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.0. This can be attributed to stress from cardiac arrest, epinephrine administration, and abdominal catastrophe.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG surgery. Further evaluation is needed to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and transferred to the CCU. The patient is currently off pressors and extubated.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Rhythm/PEA: The patient has a chronic history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is on anticoagulation. She experienced a temporary pacer line placement due to bradycardia, but her pulse/pressure returned. Possible causes for the PEA include pulmonary embolism (PE), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), myocardial infarction (MI), mesenteric ischemia, metabolic abnormalities, hypoxia, medication overdose, or acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but the etiology is unclear. Potential causes may include sepsis, acidosis, aortic dissection, or hyperkalemia. Monitoring potassium levels and considering additional investigations such as a CT chest and abdominal scan would be appropriate.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia, as evidenced by crackles on examination, cardiomegaly, and a"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent abdominal pain, who presented with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated, extubated, and taken to the cardiac care unit (CCU).
- The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on anticoagulation therapy.
- She has been experiencing hypotension, which has resolved, with an unclear etiology.
- The patient is now extubated and has a new onset cough. She has bibasilar inspiratory crackles bilaterally and no wheezes or rhonchi. A sputum culture was ordered, and she was given Robitussin for her cough.
- The patient's acute renal failure has improved, with a baseline creatinine of 1.0, which was elevated to 2.0 on presentation but has now recovered back to 0.9.
- She had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0 at admission, which is consistent with the stress of cardiac arrest, epinephrine administration, and abdominal catastrophe. She was started on Zosyn and then switched to levofloxacin due to improvement in renal function.
- The patient's history of CAD includes previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib) who presented with abdominal pain and progressed to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated, extubated, and is now off pressors. The patient has a chronic history of AFib and is on anticoagulation. She experienced a temporary pacer line placement due to bradycardia during resuscitation. Her current vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 140/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals bibasilar inspiratory crackles bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi. 

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of hypoxia with an LLL infiltrate, cardiomegaly, and crackles on exam. It is important to continue monitoring her oxygen saturation levels and consider interventions such as increasing the oxygen flow rate or administering bronchodilators if necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and new onset cough could indicate an infection. Sputum culture and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated to address any potential pneumonia or sinusitis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was"
