","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy. The patient also had a peri-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient presented with hypotension, leukocytosis, chills, and a chest X-ray showing a possible retrocardiac opacity. He was started on levofloxacin overnight and his Foley catheter was removed. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (normal range: 76-92 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 88/42 mmHg (normal range: 84-102/60 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal range: 11-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's physical examination findings include general weakness and fatigue, clear lungs with poor inspiratory effort, midline low back dressing, and warm dry lower extremities with pedal edema. Neurological examination reveals alert and oriented, appropriate interaction, limited English, but able to communicate.

   DISPO: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy. The patient experienced a postoperative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current symptoms include nausea and vomiting, which started after taking miralax for bowel movement regimen. He also reports no bowel movement since the surgery, raising concerns of possible ileus or obstruction. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (blood pressure in the 80s), tachycardia (heart rate around 92 bpm), and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His respiratory support is not required.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and an elevated creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes show hyponatremia (sodium level of 36 mg/dL) and hypochloremia (chloride level of 22 mEq/L). The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with an INR of 1.3.

He underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy but experienced complications including a peri-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's current vital signs show a blood pressure in the 90s, which is below normal. His heart rate is 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, indicating a regular heartbeat. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,870 mL and output of 900 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,970 mL. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 245 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, glucose of 108 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, and potassium levels within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, regular heart rate with normal S1 and S2 sounds, poor inspiratory effort with clear to absent airway, midline low back dressing, soft obese abdomen, warm dry extremities with pedal edema, and alert and oriented neurologically with appropriate interaction.

   -Patient initially transferred to on the evening of [**5-6**] for hypotension
   to the 80s that was initially responsive to IVF, following IVF, SBP
   then dropped to the high 70's despite NS boluses.  EKG appeared
   unchanged from prior but did show stable diffuse ST depressions in
   V3-V6, I, II, aVL, aVF.   Repeat TTE while in the CCU showed focal
   basal inferior hypokinesis, mild-mod TR & MR, trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. Adjustment to meds: Lopressor decreased to 12.5
   mg TID, imdur d/c'd.  SBP imprpoved and remained in 90's during CCU
   course without need for vasopressor therapy.  CXR demonstrated possible
   retrocardiac opacity and patient started levofloxacin for possible
   PNA.  Given patient's improvement in BP, pt was transferred to
   cardiology floor for continued care.
   -At ~ noon on [**5-8**], patient was found down on the ground by nursing
   staff, and was reported in the restroom just prior to being found
   unresponsive.  No pulse was palpable and telemetry strip demonstrated a
   slow, possible junctional rhythm.  Chest compressions were initiated,
   and shortly thereafter the patient was noted to be in sinus
   tachycardia.  No shocks or intravenous medications were administered.
   The patient was intubated for airway protection, and brought to the CCU
   for further care.
   -Repeat 12-lead EKG shows continued ST depressions in the same
   distribution as prior.

The EKG showed stable diffuse ST depressions in V3-V6, I, II, aVL, and aVF.

 CALLED OUT
   -Patient initially transferred to on the evening of [**5-6**] for hypotension
   to the 80s that was initially responsive to IVF, following IVF, SBP
   then dropped to the high 70's despite NS boluses.  EKG appeared
   unchanged from prior but did show stable diffuse ST depressions in
   V3-V6, I, II, aVL, aVF.   Repeat TTE while in the CCU showed focal
   basal inferior hypokinesis, mild-mod TR & MR, trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. Adjustment to meds: Lopressor decreased to 12.5
   mg TID, imdur d/c'd.  SBP imprpoved and remained in 90's during CCU
   course without need for vasopressor therapy.  CXR demonstrated possible
   retrocardiac opacity and patient started levofloxacin for possible
   PNA.  Given patient's improvement in BP, pt was transferred to
   cardiology floor for continued care.
   -At ~ noon on [**5-8**], patient was found down on the ground by nursing
   staff, and was reported in the restroom just prior to being found
   unresponsive.  No pulse was palpable and telemetry strip demonstrated a
   slow, possible junctional rhythm.  Chest compressions were initiated,
   and shortly thereafter the patient was noted to be in sinus
   tachycardia.  No shocks or intravenous medications were administered.
   The patient was intubated for airway protection, and brought to the CCU
   for further care. Repeat 12-lead EKG shows continued ST depressions in
   the same distribution as prior.  Bedside TTE showed no change or new
   WMA.  ABG on arrival was: 7.4/40/65 on AC 16/550/5/100%, Lactate 4.3, K

   post-op). The patient was started on ASA 325mg and BB titrated up.
   ok);  Initially deferred cardiac cath and risk for periprocedural
   complication that could warrant anticoagulation despite EKG changes;
   ECHO on [**5-4**] showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Patient initially
   transferred to CCU for transient hypotension that was fluid
   responsive.  Possible cardiogenic shock vs automonic dysfunction vs
   hypovolemia.  Code blue called this afternoon when patient found down
   on the ground unresponsive in possible PEA arrest. Patient regained
   pulse and sinus rhythm after 1-2 minutes of CPR without shocks or
   intravenous medications.  12-lead EKG shows unchanged ST depressions in
   lateral leads.  Pt initially  very hypoxic on 100% FiO2 on arrival to
   CCU with CXR showing worsening pulmonary edema.

   Cardiliology fellow-
   Pt well known to us from recent  transfer; 70yo M w/ Dm, CRI s/p recent
   spinal surgery (laminectomy) with postop STD/hypotension, brief prior
   stay in CCU. He returns with symptomatic bradycardia requiring CPR and
   intubation. TTE shows more prominent inferior posterior wall motion
   abnormalities, with unchanged ST depressions across the precordium on
   ECG. The precipitating events were possibly vagal in nature, as it was
   around the time of going to the bathroom. However, he will eventually
   need cardiac catheterization. We will continue ASA, and start heparin
   if cleared by neurosurgery, and plan for cath when possible and with
   improvement of his renal function. He has self extubated,and we will
   diureses as necessary for pulmonary interstitial edema. The balance of
   the plan per CCU housestaff note above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis, and a history of peri-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent elective laminectomy and discectomy but developed post-operative hypotension and respiratory failure. He was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the CCU. The patient experienced a code blue event where he was found unresponsive on the ground, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. He regained pulse and sinus rhythm after CPR without shocks or intravenous medications. The patient's 12-lead EKG showed unchanged ST depressions in lateral leads. His CXR demonstrated worsening pulmonary edema. The patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled, but he has an elevated creatinine level of 1.9, indicating renal impairment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's history of NSTEMI and ongoing cardiac ischemia increases the risk of further cardiac events such as unstable angina or another myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if he does not improve or if there is a delay in weaning off the ventilator.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests renal impairment, which can worsen if the patient continues to experience hypotension or"

   24 Hour Events:
 CALLED OUT
   -Patient initially transferred to on the evening of [**5-6**] for hypotension
   to the 80s that was initially responsive to IVF, following IVF, SBP
   then dropped to the high 70's despite NS boluses.  EKG appeared
   unchanged from prior but did show stable diffuse ST depressions in
   V3-V6, I, II, aVL, aVF.   Repeat TTE while in the CCU showed focal
   basal inferior hypokinesis, mild-mod TR & MR, trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. Adjustment to meds: Lopressor decreased to 12.5
   mg TID, imdur d/c'd.  SBP imprpoved and remained in 90's during CCU
   course without need for vasopressor therapy.  CXR demonstrated possible
   retrocardiac opacity and patient started levofloxacin for possible
   PNA.  Given patient's improvement in BP, pt was transferred to
   cardiology floor for continued care.
   -At ~ noon on [**5-8**], patient was found down on the ground by nursing
   staff, and was reported in the restroom just prior to being found
   unresponsive.  No pulse was palpable and telemetry strip demonstrated a
   slow, possible junctional rhythm.  Chest compressions were initiated,
   and shortly thereafter the patient was noted to be in sinus
   tachycardia.  No shocks or intravenous medications were administered.
   The patient was intubated for airway protection, and brought to the CCU
   for further care.
   -Repeat 12-lead EKG shows continued ST depressions in the same
   distribution as prior.
   -Bedside TTE showed new, worsened inferior/posterior WMA.
   -ABG on arrival was: 7.4/40/65 on AC 16/550/5/100%, Lactate 4.3, K
   4.4.
   -CXR showed: prelim read - pulmonary edema, no obvious infiltrates, and
   borderline widened mediastinum.

   #CAD - peri-op NSTEMI (peak CK 4918 MB 74 on [**5-4**]), Pt initially unable
   to receive anticoag w/ heparin/plavix given risk of anti-coagulation
   post-op from neuro surgery procedure. (contraindicated x 1 week
   post-op). The patient was started on ASA 325mg and BB titrated up. ok);
    Initially deferred cardiac cath and risk for periprocedural
   complication that could warrant anticoagulation despite EKG changes;
   ECHO on [**5-4**] showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Patient initially
   transferred to CCU for transient hypotension that was fluid
   responsive.  Possible cardiogenic shock vs automonic dysfunction vs
   hypovolemia.  Code blue called this afternoon when patient found down
   on the ground unresponsive in possible PEA arrest. Patient regained
   pulse and sinus rhythm after 1-2 minutes of CPR without shocks or
   intravenous medications.  12-lead EKG shows unchanged ST depressions in
   lateral leads.  Pt initially  very hypoxic on 100% FiO2 on arrival to
   CCU with CXR showing worsening pulmonary edema.

   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU presented with a chief complaint of code blue, possibly due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest or a vasovagal episode. The patient was initially transferred for hypotension in the evening, which responded to IV fluids (IVF), but then the blood pressure dropped again despite normal saline (NS) boluses. The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed stable diffuse ST depressions in leads V3-V6, I, II, aVL, and aVF. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed focal basal inferior hypokinesis, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and mitral regurgitation (MR), as well as trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Medications were adjusted, including decreasing Lopressor to 12.5 mg TID and discontinuing imdur. The blood pressure improved and remained in the 90s during the critical care unit (CCU) course without the need for vasopressor therapy. A chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated possible retrocardiac opacity, prompting the initiation of levofloxacin for possible pneumonia. The patient was then transferred to the cardiology floor for continued care.

On another occasion, the patient was found unresponsive by the nursing staff and had no palpable pulse. Telemetry showed a slow, possible junctional rhythm. Chest compressions were initiated,"

 CALLED OUT
   -Patient initially transferred to on the evening of [**5-6**] for hypotension
   to the 80s that was initially responsive to IVF, following IVF, SBP
   then dropped to the high 70's despite NS boluses.  EKG appeared
   unchanged from prior but did show stable diffuse ST depressions in
   V3-V6, I, II, aVL, aVF.   Repeat TTE while in the CCU showed focal
   basal inferior hypokinesis, mild-mod TR & MR, trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. Adjustment to meds: Lopressor decreased to 12.5
   mg TID, imdur d/c'd.  SBP imprpoved and remained in 90's during CCU
   course without need for vasopressor therapy.  CXR demonstrated possible
   retrocardiac opacity and patient started levofloxacin for possible
   PNA.  Given patient's improvement in BP, pt was transferred to
   cardiology floor for continued care.
   -At ~ noon on [**5-8**], patient was found down on the ground by nursing
   staff, and was reported in the restroom just prior to being found
   unresponsive.  No pulse was palpable and telemetry strip demonstrated a
   slow, possible junctional rhythm.  Chest compressions were initiated,
   and shortly thereafter the patient was noted to be in sinus
   tachycardia.  No shocks or intravenous medications were administered.
   The patient was intubated for airway protection, and brought to the CCU
   for further care.
   -Repeat 12-lead EKG shows continued ST depressions in the same
   distribution as prior.
   -Bedside TTE showed new, worsened inferior/posterior WMA.
   -ABG on arrival was: 7.4/40/65 on AC 16/550/5/100%, Lactate 4.3, K

   DISPO: CCU for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis, and post-operative NSTEMI. The patient underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy but experienced complications including peri-operative NSTEMI. Due to the neurosurgical procedure, the patient was unable to receive anticoagulation with heparin/plavix for one week post-operation. The patient was started on aspirin and beta-blockers titrated up. There is a deferred cardiac catheterization due to the risk of periprocedural complications. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, possible cardiogenic shock, autonomic dysfunction, or hypovolemia. The patient also presents with chills, suggesting an infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and the presence of diffuse ST depressions in multiple leads on EKG indicate possible cardiogenic shock. This is further supported by the history of peri-operative NSTEMI.
2. Autonomic Dysfunction: The patient's hypotension could be due to autonomic dysfunction, which can occur after major surgeries.
3. Hypovolemia: Another possible cause of the patient's hypotension is hypovolemia, which can result from fluid loss during surgery or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Infection: The patient's presentation of chills"

   Cardiliology fellow-
   Pt well known to us from recent  transfer; 70yo M w/ Dm, CRI s/p recent
   spinal surgery (laminectomy) with postop STD/hypotension, brief prior
   stay in CCU. He returns with symptomatic bradycardia requiring CPR and
   intubation. TTE shows more prominent inferior posterior wall motion
   abnormalities, with unchanged ST depressions across the precordium on
   ECG. The precipitating events were possibly vagal in nature, as it was
   around the time of going to the bathroom. However, he will eventually
   need cardiac catheterization. We will continue ASA, and start heparin
   if cleared by neurosurgery, and plan for cath when possible and with
   improvement of his renal function. He has self extubated,and we will
   diureses as necessary for pulmonary interstitial edema. The balance of
   the plan per CCU housestaff note above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent elective laminectomy and left L3-4 discectomy. The patient experienced peri-operative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was unable to receive anticoagulation with heparin/plavix due to the risk of bleeding post-neurosurgery. The patient was started on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg and beta-blocker (BB) titrated up. The patient initially showed transient hypotension that was responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). 

On [**5-7**], the patient was found down on the ground unresponsive and experienced possible pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient regained pulse and sinus rhythm after 1-2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) without shocks or intravenous medications. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed unchanged ST depressions in lateral leads. The patient was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). 

On [**5-8**], the patient had another episode of unresponsiveness and was found down on the ground. No pulse was palpable, and the telemetry strip demonstrated a slow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of lumbar spine surgery. The patient presented to the hospital with a perioperative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). On admission, he was found to have extensive inferior and posterior wall contractile dysfunction on echocardiogram, indicative of continued ischemia. He was started on heparin and plans for coronary catheterization were made. Currently, the patient is cardiopulmonary resuscitation-free and hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued ischemia due to coronary artery disease, which could lead to further myocardial damage and potential arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary edema, as evidenced by the chest X-ray, which may worsen if fluid balance is not maintained properly.
3. Hypoxia due to pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange, potentially requiring oxygen supplementation or mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal insufficiency, indicated by the elevated creatinine levels, which may require careful monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly.
5. Potential bleeding complications due to the use of heparin, especially considering the patient's history of recent surgery.
6. Hypotension, indicated by the low blood pressure readings, which may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
7. Infection, given the patient's immunocom"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis status post elective laminectomy and discectomy, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with extensive inferior and posterior wall contractile dysfunction on echocardiogram, indicating continued ischemia. He was started on heparin and plans for a coronary catheterization are in place.

The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has decreased from 55% to 35-40%, likely due to ischemia. The patient also has pulmonary edema as evidenced by chest X-ray and is being diuresed overnight with a negative 1 liter output. The goal is to achieve an output of -1.5 to 2 liters.

The patient self-extubated but remained stable with oxygen saturation at 80 off non-rebreather mask. The goal is to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Diuretics should be continued, and electrolyte management should be monitored.

The patient's pain is well-controlled, and neurosurgery plans to continue following up. The patient should continue on gabapentin and oxycodone as needed.

The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.2 mg/dL and is trending upward, likely due to poor forward flow and subsequent hypoperfusion. Di"

   Assessment and Plan
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with ongoing hypotension and signs of poor perfusion. 

The patient has been receiving IV fluids and medications such as furosemide (Lasix) to manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema. However, despite these interventions, the patient's condition remains critical with persistent hypotension and evidence of ongoing cardiac dysfunction. 

The echocardiogram showed extensive inferior and posterior wall contractile dysfunction, which explains the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The widened mediastinum seen on the X-ray could be due to plump veins in the setting of poor systolic output.

The patient's vital signs are unstable with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The oxygen saturation remains within normal limits, but the patient is on high-flow oxygen through a non-rebreather mask.

The laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated levels of troponin-T, CK-MB, and lactic acid. The white blood cell count is also elevated, suggesting an inflammatory response. The kidney function tests show some impairment with increased creatinine levels.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ongoing hypotension and evidence of poor cardiac function suggest that he is at risk of further deterioration in"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis, and previous lumbar laminectomy/discectomy. She presented with acute onset of chest pain and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent an elective laminectomy/discectomy but developed perioperative NSTEMI.

Her current condition shows ongoing ischemia with extensive inferior and posterior wall contractile dysfunction on echocardiogram. She is hemodynamically stable and her creatine kinase (CK) level peaked at 922 with a troponin T level of 1.91. She is currently receiving heparin drip and planned for coronary catheterization on Monday.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of loss of consciousness (LOC), which may be due to seizures, other neurological processes, or aspiration. An EEG and head CT are planned to further evaluate these episodes.

The patient also has pulmonary edema with a chest X-ray showing improvement in edema. She is on non-rebreather oxygen and her oxygen saturation is 89%. She is receiving diuretics to manage her fluid balance.

The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 2.1. She has a history of hypoglycemia, so her NPH insulin dose has been decreased and her sliding scale insulin regimen adjusted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis, and previous lumbar spine surgery. She presented with acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent elective laminectomy/discectomy on [**5-4**]. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple medical complications.

24-hour events:
- ECG showed improved ST-segments.
- Chest X-ray demonstrated slight improvement in pulmonary edema, consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF) and possible infection. The patient was started on levofloxacin.
- Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked at 922, MB 31 (trending down to 642, but troponin T increased to 1.91 in the setting of acute renal failure).
- Potassium levels remained stable at 2.1.
- Intake/Output: 8pm -1.5L.
- Hypoglycemic episodes occurred, with fasting blood sugar (FS) at 59. The NPH dose was decreased from 14 to 10 units at bedtime, and the 70/30 ratio was decreased to 50:50. Overnight, the hypoglycemic episodes continued, and the PM dose of NPH was held due to poor oral intake.
- The patient experienced two episodes of loss of consciousness (LOC), each lasting a few minutes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis, and previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent elective laminectomy and discectomy but experienced perioperative NSTEMI. The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to multiple medical complications.

24-hour events:
- ECG showed improved ST-depressions.
- Chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated slight improvement in pulmonary edema, consistent with CHF and possible infection. Levofloxacin was started for infection treatment.
- Cardiac enzymes (CE): CK peaked at 922, MB 31. CK trending down to 642, but Troponin T increased to 1.91 in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF).
- Potassium levels (PM lytes) remained stable at 2.1 mEq/L.
- Fluid balance: Total input/output (I/O) was -1.5L.
- Hypoglycemic episodes occurred with fasting blood sugar (FS) of 59, decreased NPH to 10 units, and 70/30 ratio decreased to 50/50. Overnight dose of NPH was held due to continuous hypoglycemia and poor oral intake.
- The patient experienced two episodes of acute loss of consciousness (LOC"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent an elective laminectomy/discectomy. The patient experienced perioperative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory status and evidence of pulmonary edema. The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and he is now on 4 liters of oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. There is also a concern for potential hemorrhage due to the presence of hemoptysis and focal opacity in the left upper lung seen on chest X-ray, which could be consistent with infection or pulmonary edema.

The patient's neurological status has been a concern, with episodes of agitation and potential orthostatic changes. However, syncope or seizure is less likely. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not provided in the note, but neurology believes that positional orthostatic changes are the cause. The patient's EEG and swallow evaluation have not been completed yet.

The patient's cardiac status shows a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and there is evidence of decreased ejection fraction (EF) from 55% to 35-40%, likely related to ischemia. The patient's blood pressure remains stable with"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient experienced a small episode of hemoptysis with sputum, leading to a chest X-ray that revealed focal opacity in the left upper lung, which could be consistent with infection superimposed on pulmonary edema or parenchymal hemorrhage.
- Neurology consulted and believed the patient's symptoms were consistent with orthostatic episodes, not syncope or seizure. No speech and swallow evaluation was done over the weekend.
- There were no signs of intracranial hemorrhage on the CT head, and an EEG had not been done yet.
- The dose of gabapentin was reduced from 800mg three times a day to 300mg once daily due to renal dosing.
- The patient reported worsening orthopnea and increased oxygen requirement, necessitating the use of a non-rebreather mask. Lasix 60 IV was given, and another dose was administered later.
- The patient had a positive guaiac stool test.
- The patient became agitated around midnight but resolved with the administration of ambien 5.
- Mucomyst and ordered for AM precath hydration were given.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/72 mmHg to 120/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent elective laminectomy and discectomy. The patient had complications post-operation including perioperative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently in the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:
- The patient experienced a small episode of hemoptysis with sputum, leading to a chest X-ray which showed focal opacity in the left upper lung, possibly due to infection superimposed on pulmonary edema or parenchymal hemorrhage.
- Neurology consulted and believed the patient's episodes of altered mental status were consistent with orthostatic episodes, not syncope or seizures.
- The patient had worsening orthopnea and increased oxygen requirement, now on 4 liters per nasal cannula with a non-rebreather mask.
- The patient had a grossly guaiac positive bowel movement, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient was agitated around midnight but resolved with Ambien 5 mg.
- Mucomyst and hydration were ordered for the morning, but the patient did not receive it.
- Lasix 60 IV was given due to fluid overload.
- The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable, but there were episodes of hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy on [5-4]. He is currently in the ICU due to postoperative complications, including a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and inferior wall ischemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including worsening orthopnea, increased oxygen requirement, hemoptysis, and a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He also has bibasilar crackles, wheezing on expiration, and triceps pedal edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of worsening orthopnea and increased oxygen requirement suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which is consistent with the findings of bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation.
2. Infection Superimposed on Pulmonary Edema: The presence of focal opacity in the left upper lung on the chest X-ray may indicate an infection superimposed on pulmonary edema.
3. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: Although less likely, the possibility of pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered given the patient's hemoptysis and positive guaiac test.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The positive guaiac test suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be evaluated and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis, and previous lumbar laminectomy/discectomy. The patient had an elective laminectomy/discectomy on [**5-4**] that was complicated by a peri-operative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current medical issues include coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (pump failure), rhythm disturbances, altered mental status (LOC), pulmonary issues, post-operative pain management, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization today, which revealed significant coronary artery disease including 90% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) at the proximal and mid-vessel, 90% ostial stenosis and 95% at mid-segment in the left circumflex artery (LCx), and total occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) with distal RCA fill by collateral flow. An EEG showed mild encephalopathy with no epileptiform discharges.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/42"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lumbar stenosis status post elective laminectomy/discectomy, and a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization today and was found to have multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient's post-procedure course has been complicated by mild encephalopathy with no epileptiform discharges on EEG, delirium, agitation, and poor inspiratory effort with bibasilar crackles and wheezing on expiration.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate 63 bpm, blood pressure 100/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on nasal cannula, and heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 894 mL, with outputs of 360 mL PO, 90 mL TF, 534 mL IVF, and 3,265 mL urine, resulting in a negative balance of 2,371 mL.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy but developed postoperative complications including a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current condition indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has significant stenosis in multiple coronary arteries, including 90% stenosis in the proximal and mid-vessel of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, 90% ostial stenosis in the left circumflex (LCx) artery, and 95% mid-segment stenosis in the LCx artery. Additionally, there is total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) with distal RCA fill by collateral vessels.

2. Cardiogenic shock (PUMP): The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has decreased from 55% to 35-40%, indicating impaired cardiac function. This may be related to ischemia. The patient also has worsening orthopnea and increased oxygen requirement, along with worsening chest X-ray findings. The patient has been negative for 1.3 liters overnight on lasix 60 IV BID, suggesting fluid overload. More diuresis may be needed after the cardiac catheterization procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy. The patient experienced perioperative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and had a cardiac catheterization today, which revealed significant coronary artery disease, including a 90% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), 90% ostial stenosis in the left circumflex artery (LCx), and 95% mid segment stenosis in the LCx. Additionally, there was a total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also has mild encephalopathy with no epileptiform discharges on EEG and delirium that required IV haloperidol. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have poor inspiratory effort, bibasilar crackles, and wheezing on expiration. The patient is receiving heparin, furosemide, and other medications as per the assessment plan. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, troponin T, and lactic acid levels. The patient's current disposition is in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease with significant stenosis in multiple arteries may"

","The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar stenosis who presented to the hospital with an episode of delirium. The patient underwent an elective laminectomy and discectomy on [**5-4**] which was complicated by peri-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's cardiac catheterization showed triple vessel disease, left circumflex artery 90% stenosis at the ostium and mid-segment, and total occlusion of the right coronary artery with distal filling by collateral vessels. The patient's ejection fraction is now 35-40%, reduced from 55% on [**2133-5-6**], likely related to ischemia.

The patient's recent vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 63 bpm with a first-degree AV block, blood pressure ranging from 100/42 mmHg to 109/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula, and a pulse oximetry reading of 31%. The patient's weight is 76 kg, and their fluid balance shows a total intake of 894 mL, with a negative balance of 2,371 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of"
