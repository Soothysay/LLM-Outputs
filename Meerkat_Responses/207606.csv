   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also
   includes post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in
   correct time frame per Heme-Onc; received
   1. Altered Mental Status
   Etiology of his altered mental status is likely multifactorial related
   to his gram negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to
   parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia. Encephalitis or
   meningitis are also possible. Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]
   and had only 1 WBCs, although this is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of neutropenia. His glucose and total protein were normal,
   which is somewhat reassuring. Additional infection is also possible,
   although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia
   has been relatively chronic during this admission and is likely not a
   large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - will start treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   desensitization protocol (see below)
   - will start noninvasive ventilation for increased ventilation to
   improve his hypercarbia with intubation as needed
   - follow-up CSF Cultures
   - follow-up CSF studies - Toxoplasma gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and
   Coccidiodes
   - avoid further psychotropic medications
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. E. coli Bacteremia and UTI
   Patient had ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**], although subsequent urine
   cultures were negative after treatment with aztreonam. Surprisingly
   then his blood cultures returned with ESBL bacteremia on [**2165-3-15**],
   despite clearing of his urinary tract infection. He has been on
   aztreonam and gentamicin for treatment of this, although meropenem
   would be preferred in this patient due to inferiority of gentamicin in
   neutropenic patients. Patient unfortunately has anaphylaxis reaction to
   penicillins in the past and will need meropenem desensitiziation
   protocol for this.
   - discontinue gentamicin
   - continue vancomycin for broad gram positive coverage in this patient
   with febrile neutropenia, will follow-up with BMT regarding peeling
   this back given no gram positive infection to date and cultures NGTD
   - will follow-up with BMT team regarding need for micafungin
   - allergy consultation
   - start meropenem desensitization protocol once respiratory status is
   improved
   - will need tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology once
   patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint and has received first
   dose of meropenem
   - daily blood cultures
   - appreciate ID input
   3. Hypoxia and Hypercarbia
   Patient is both hypoxic and hypercarbic, likely due to parainfluenza
   infection and obstructive sleep apnea.
   - will try noninvasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and
   ventilation; if no improvement will need to intubate
   4. Myeloma
   Patient is now day + 9 for SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - continue acyclovir, clotrimazole, and bactrim prophylaxis
   - continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - continue immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate
   mofetil
   5. Hyponatremia
   Etiology is most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia.
   - continue to monitor daily sodium
   - continue free water restriction
   - continue salt tabs
   6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   Patient with difficult to control blood glucose in the setting of
   infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   - continue insulin sliding scale with lantus
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past requiring Metoprolol
   Succinate 50mg PO bid and amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily. Currently
   normotensive
   - hold Toprol XL and amlodipine in the setting of gram negative rod
   bacteremia and will restart if BP increases
   8. Depression
   Patient has a history of major depression with significant medication
   requirements.
   - appreciate psychiatry input
   - continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   9. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue timolol eye drops
   10. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - hold atorvastatin in the acute setting
   11. Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   Stable
   - continue gapabentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone prn
   12. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 61-year-old male who is on day 9 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

Respiratory distress: The patient has quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates yesterday, highly suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis also includes post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome, as suggested by the hematology-oncology team. 

Altered mental status: The etiology of the altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including gram-negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to parainfluenza infection, further worsened by hyponatremia. Encephalitis or meningitis are also possible, although lumbar puncture results showed only 1 WBC, which may not be reliable due to neutropenia. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures remain negative for additional infection. 

Treatment plan:
- Start treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem desensitization protocol.
- Start noninvasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and ventilation, and intubation as needed.
- Follow-up CSF cultures and studies, including Toxoplasma gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidioid"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   1. Altered Mental Status
   Etiology of his altered mental status is likely multifactorial related
   to his gram negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to
   parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia. Encephalitis or
   meningitis are also possible. Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]
   and had only 1 WBCs, although this is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of neutropenia. His glucose and total protein were normal,
   which is somewhat reassuring. Additional infection is also possible,
   although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia
   has been relatively chronic during this admission and is likely not a
   large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - will start treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   desensitization protocol (see below)
   - will start noninvasive ventilation for increased ventilation to
   improve his hypercarbia with intubation as needed
   - follow-up CSF Cultures
   - follow-up CSF studies - Toxoplasma gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and
   Coccidiodes
   - avoid further psychotropic medications
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. E. coli Bacteremia and UTI
   Patient had ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**], although subsequent urine
   cultures were negative after treatment with aztreonam. Surprisingly
   then his blood cultures returned with ESBL bacteremia on [**2165-3-15**],
   despite clearing of his urinary tract infection. He has been on
   aztreonam and gentamicin for treatment of this, although meropenem
   would be preferred in this patient due to inferiority of gentamicin in
   neutropenic patients. Patient unfortunately has anaphylaxis reaction to
   penicillins in the past and will need meropenem desensitiziation
   protocol for this.
   - discontinue gentamicin
   - continue vancomycin for broad gram positive coverage in this patient
   with febrile neutropenia, will follow-up with BMT regarding peeling
   this back given no gram positive infection to date and cultures NGTD
   - will follow-up with BMT team regarding need for micafungin
   - allergy consultation
   - start meropenem desensitization protocol once respiratory status is
   improved
   - will need tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology once
   patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint and has received first
   dose of meropenem
   - daily blood cultures
   - appreciate ID input
   3. Hypoxia and Hypercarbia
   Patient is both hypoxic and hypercarbic, likely due to parainfluenza
   infection and obstructive sleep apnea.
   - will try noninvasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and
   ventilation; if no improvement will need to intubate
   4. Myeloma
   Patient is now day + 9 for SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - continue acyclovir, clotrimazole, and bactrim prophylaxis
   - continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - continue immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate
   mofetil
   5. Hyponatremia
   Etiology is most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia.
   - continue to monitor daily sodium
   - continue free water restriction
   - continue salt tabs
   6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   Patient with difficult to control blood glucose in the setting of
   infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   - continue insulin sliding scale with lantus
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past requiring Metoprolol
   Succinate 50mg PO bid and amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily. Currently
   normotensive
   - hold Toprol XL and amlodipine in the setting of gram negative rod
   bacteremia and will restart if BP increases
   8. Depression
   Patient has a history of major depression with significant medication
   requirements.
   - appreciate psychiatry input
   - continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   9. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue timolol eye drops
   10. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - hold atorvastatin in the acute setting
   11. Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   Stable
   - continue gapabentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone prn
   12. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. Lastly, could represent
   DAH; less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   - Mech vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   - Cont vanco and meropenem
   - Cont micafungin
   - Cont ACV for ppx
   - Bronch today with lavage, will send off sputum cx to r/o above
   - Check urine legionella
   - F/u pending cultures
   - Received high-dose solumedrol x 1, will f/u with Heme re: inclination
   to continue treating possible engraftment syndrome
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to his gram
   negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to parainfluenza,
   further worsened by hyponatremia. Lumbar puncture was performed on
   [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret in the setting of neutropenia but
   nl glucose and total protein reassuring. Additional infection is also
   possible, although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection.
   Hyponatremia has been relatively chronic during this admission and is
   likely not a large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - Continue treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   - Now on vent
   - Follow-up Blood and urine cx, CSF Cx and studies (Toxoplasma gondii,
   EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   - Appreciate Psych recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   - Will need to discuss with Heme-Onc whether lines can be d/c
d in
   setting of septicemia given concern for colonization. If so, will
   likely need IR-guided line placement.
   - Daily blood cultures
   - F/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. [**Month (only) 51**] be multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin.
   - Renal consult
   - Fluid bolus for now, recheck lytes in AM
   - Dose all meds renally and d/c nonessential
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day + 10 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - F/u BMT recs
   - Continue acyclovir, clotrimazole, and bactrim prophylaxis per
   protocol
   - Continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - Continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia.
   - Continue to monitor daily sodium
   - Continue free water restriction and salt tabs
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   - Will continue insulin sliding scale with lantus
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past requiring Metoprolol
   Succinate 50mg PO bid and amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily. Currently
   normotensive
   - Hold Toprol XL and amlodipine in the setting of gram negative rod
   bacteremia and will restart if BP increases
   8. Depression
   Patient has a history of major depression with significant medication
   requirements.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male on day +9 of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma, admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has a history of multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, GERD, and allergies to penicillins.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress with evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), altered mental status likely due to a combination of factors such as gram-negative rod bacteremia, hypercarbia related to parainfluenza infection, and hyponatremia. He also has E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI) with ESBL-producing strain, oliguric renal failure, and myeloma.

The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a goal tidal volume of 4 mL/kg ideal body weight according to ARDS protocol. He is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin, and will undergo bronchoscopy with lavage to rule out various infectious etiologies. Additional cultures are pending.

Other ongoing concerns include the need for a renal consult due to oliguric renal failure, possible line-related infection, and the potential"

   Urine-_ESBL E. Coli
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with MM and now with ATG given and found to have UTI-_Rx
   with ABX with stem cell infusion given [**3-8**].  He then evolved fever and
   altered mental status and with need for ongoing Rx for GNR bacteremia
   with E. Coli having been seen in Urine pre-transplant.  He does have
   history of anaphylactic reaction to PCN in past and with need for
   Meropenem Rx patient transfer to ICU with increased somnolence and need
   for desensitization.  Across the past 24 hours patient has had
   progressive respiratory failure with persistent and worsening hypoxemia
   despite BIPAP suppor non-invasively.  This is all concering for
   evolution of significant sepsis in the setting of incompletely
   controlled GNR bacteremia with antibiotic choice limited by significant
   anaphylactic response to PCN seen in the past.  He now has progressed
   to hypoxemic respiratory failure consistent with ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure
This does appear to be acute onset of bilateral
   pulmonary infiltrates, P/F ratio <200 and not clearly attributable to
   left heart failure.  Additionally he has suggestion of possible
   engraftment syndrome as timing is reasonable.  The notion that this is
   secondary to Meropenem is significantly less likely as BP stable and no
   evidence of prominent wheezing.  Viral pneumonia has to be considered
   but patient has been in hospital
   -Will ventilate with low tidal volume ventilation
   -FIO2 weaned to 0.5
   -PEEP quite adequate and will utilize balloon monitoring if FIO2 unable
   to be weaned
   -Check sputum for vial and bacterial pathogens
BAL for DAH and possible
   pathogens would be reasonable for alveolar sample and quantitative
   specimen and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 7300**].
   -Continue with broad spectum ABX
   -Will advance ETT by 2 cm
   2)Sepsis-This is clear evidence of significant bacteremia and sepsis
   with ARDS seen at this time.  Patient has had signfiicant bacteremia
   with indwelling catheters in place needed for access.  The issue is
   patient has had recurrence and significant decline in the setting of
   the antibiotic choices have been limited by allergic reaction in the
   past.  Encouragingly patient has had tolerance of desensitization.
   -Vanco/Meropenem
   -Mycofungin
   -Would favor D/C of all CVL
s and we will replace with TLC for sepsis
   management
will discuss with ID and BMT
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likely pre-renal and in the setting of sepsis and possible ATN
   -Will follow U/O and in the setting of oliguria will have to consider
   CVVH if needed.
   4)S/P BMT
   -MMF
   -Cyclosporine
   -Will continue to discuss closely
   -Will clarify need for flow cytometry with BMT fellow

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to severe sepsis with GNR bacteremia. There are bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and the patient's oxygenation is compromised. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation. The plan includes weaning the FiO2 to 0.5, utilizing balloon monitoring if FiO2 cannot be weaned, and obtaining sputum samples for viral and bacterial pathogens.

2. Sepsis: The patient has significant bacteremia and sepsis, likely due to indwelling catheters. Antibiotic choices have been limited by the patient's anaphylactic reaction to penicillin in the past. The patient has tolerated desensitization to meropenem, and vancomycin/meropenem therapy is being continued. Other antibiotics such as mycophenfungin are also being used. All central venous lines should be removed and replaced with tunneled lines for ongoing sepsis management. 

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing pre-renal acute renal failure, possibly due to sepsis and ATN. Close monitoring of urine output is essential, and if oliguria occurs, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary.

4. Post-transplant complications: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. Lastly, could represent DAH;
   less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -cont micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, will f/u with Heme re: inclination
   to continue treating possible engraftment syndrome, keeping in mind
   that steroids may impair immune response to possible viral pneumonia.
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -re-address with BMT and ID whether to remove lines
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 21.1 today (has been this low before although
   usually in mid 20s).
   -recheck hct in PM
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +11 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probably acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable (128-131-129).
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Currently
   normotensive.
   -holding antihypertensives in setting of gram negative rod bacteremia
   and will restart when clinically improved
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently on day +9 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to ARDS, which is likely secondary to sepsis and known parainfluenza pneumonia. Other possible causes include post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome. The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates on imaging, consistent with ARDS. He is being mechanically ventilated according to ARDSnet protocol with a goal Vt of 4 mL/kg IBW.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial and related to infection and hypercarbia. A lumbar puncture was performed, showing normal glucose and total protein levels, reassuring against additional infection. Further studies are planned to rule out other potential infections.

The patient has an ongoing E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI) despite previous treatment with aztreonam and gentamicin. He has been desensitized to meropenem, which is now being used for treatment.

Renal failure is present, likely due to hypotension during intubation, increased lactate, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporine levels, gentamic"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. Lastly, could represent DAH;
   less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -cont micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, will f/u with Heme re: inclination
   to continue treating possible engraftment syndrome
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -re-address with BMT and ID whether to remove lines
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +11 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probably acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -clotrimazole and bactrim prophylaxis per protocol
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable (128-131-129).
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Currently
   normotensive.
   -holding antihypertensives in setting of gram negative rod bacteremia
   and will restart when clinically improved
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male admit with sepsis and respiratory failure with ARDS and
   found to have Para-influenza 3 seen on BAL specimen.  He has blood
   alveolar secretions but without progressively bloody return which
   argues against ongoing active pulmonary capillaritis.  This may more
   likely represent a pattern of diffuse alveolar damage and leak of RBC's
   into alveolar space.
   1)ARDS/Respiratory Failure
he has had reasonable optimization of PEEP
   and ventilatory support with lung protective strategies.  We have CXR
   with minimal change day to day.  Peak inspiratory pressures in the
   range of 24 are quite reasonable and should be well tolerated.
   -PEEP up-titration to 12 as this was trialed with minimal change and he
   may well be just below lower inflection point of compliance curve.
   -Continuew tih Low Vt strategy and permissive hypercapnia
   -PEEP 12 today
   -Trail FIO2 wean to 0.4
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)--Hypotension, med
   effects, contrast effects and sepsis all playing a role and
   unfortunately at this time he is anuric and has continued profound
   impairment in renal function.
   -Will need CVVH for volume removal if oxygenation difficult but at this
   time would continue to renal dose meds and provide support as above and
   renal dose meds
   Neurontin to be held
   3)Sepsis-_GNR bacteremia convincingly dominant insult and will continue
   with
   -Meropenem
   -IVF as needed
   -Extensive discussions in regards to catheters
would favor continued
   maintenance of current catheters give significant difficulty with
   access and negative blood cultures
   -Will repeat blood cultures today to aid in assurance of infection

","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure, diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). He has para-influenza 3 seen on BAL specimen, indicating a viral infection. The patient has blood alveolar secretions but without progressively bloody return, suggesting a pattern of diffuse alveolar damage and leak of RBC's into the alveolar space.

1) ARDS/Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS has been managed with optimization of PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) and ventilatory support using lung-protective strategies. CXR (chest X-ray) shows minimal change day to day, with peak inspiratory pressures ranging from 24, which are reasonable and well tolerated. The plan is to up-titrate PEEP to 12, continue with low Vt (tidal volume) strategy, and allow for permissive hypercapnia. FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) weaning to 0.4 will be trialed.

2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired due to factors such as hypotension, medication effects, contrast effects, and sepsis. He is currently anuric (producing little to no urine). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) may be required for volume removal if oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. Lastly, could represent DAH;
   less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -cont micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, trying to avoid steroids in setting

   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is now on day +9. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is also concern for post-transplant reaction, engraftment syndrome, or bacterial pneumonia. The patient tested positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to infection and hypercarbia secondary to parainfluenza pneumonia. Lumbar puncture results showed normal glucose and total protein levels, reassuring against additional infection. The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), which is currently being treated with meropenem. He also has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly related to hypotension during intubation, increased lactate, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Acyclovir-related ARF is considered the top differential. The patient's anemia is being managed with packed red blood cells ("

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +12 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -wean PEEP as tolerated with goal PEEP of 8; then may try pressure
   support trial if oxygenating well (after weaning sedation)
   -continue vanco and meropenem, check vancomycin level today
   -continue micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, trying to avoid steroids in setting
   of possible viral pneumonia
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   -consider repeat CXR this afternoon
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 25, up from 20 after 1U PRBCs- appropriate bump
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +12 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Currently
   normotensive.
   -holding antihypertensives in setting of gram negative rod bacteremia
   and will restart when clinically improved
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently on day +12 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS. The patient is mechanically ventilated, and the goal is to wean PEEP as tolerated while providing adequate oxygenation.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to infection and hypercarbia secondary to parainfluenza pneumonia. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures remain negative. Hyponatremia has been relatively chronic during this admission and is not thought to be a significant contributor to the altered mental status.

The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection, which has been treated with aztreonam, gentamicin, and now meropenem. Renal failure is present, likely due to hypotension during intubation, increased lactate, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment shows numerous crystals, suggesting acyclovir-related acute renal failure.

Other issues include anemia, myeloma, hyponatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male s/p BMT for MM who is admitted with sepsis, ARDS and some
   component of alveolar hemorrhage but not evidence of active pulmonary
   capillaritis.  He has been tolerant of the low VT ventilation and PEEP
   titration.  In regards to renal failure we have seen some suggestion of
   increased urine output--although Cr continues to rise.
   1)Respiratory Failure/ARDS-_Great findings this morning of compliance
   >40 and PEEP able to be titrated down to 10.   resistance remains
   normal throughout.  This would be opportunity to look to wean
   ventilator support
   -Wean PEEP to 10 and ABG in 2 hours and wean further to goal of 8 prior
   to PSV trial
   -Will look to wean sedation to allow patient to move to PSV trial
   -Main barriers to extubation are mental status and volume overload
   2)Sepsis-
   -Micafungin
   -Meropenem
   -Will continue to monitor cultures
we have not seen further growth from
   follow up cultures and will maintain current catheters in place and
   continue to Rx with ID support
   3)Acute Renal Failure-This again, is multifactorial and renal input
   much appreciated.
   -Cyclosporine and all medications doses for renal failure
   -Acyclovir held
   -Will continue to monitor for improved urine output and renal function
   and hope to avoid CVVH with primary indication being volume overload.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus type II, and renal failure, who was admitted with sepsis, ARDS, and some component of alveolar hemorrhage but not evidence of active pulmonary capillaritis. He has been tolerating low VT ventilation and PEEP titration well.

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis, and acute renal failure. The patient's mental status and volume overload are the main barriers to extubation. The sepsis is being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medication. Acute renal failure is multifactorial, and renal input is appreciated. The patient's nutrition is being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in respiratory status, as well as for improvement in urine output and renal function. Regular assessment of mental status is also crucial for evaluating readiness to wean sedation and attempt spontaneous breathing trials (PSV)."

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +13 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -Continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials.
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other Cx data.

   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently on day +13 of the SCT and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory distress with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS, altered mental status likely multifactorial, E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection, acute renal failure possibly due to acyclovir, anemia, myeloma, hyponatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, GERD, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a high risk of developing further complications related to his lung condition.
2. Infection: The patient has an ongoing E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection, which can lead to sepsis and worsen his overall condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, making it difficult to assess his pain"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with admission with ARDS and now with significant
   improvememt in respiratory failure and able to tolerate wean of PEEP
   and move to PSV.  He retains severe oliguria and worsening renal
   failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-he is now limited by signifiant volume overload
   despite what appears to be improvement in oxygenation as ARDS has
   likely improved
however, volume overload is now primary barrier to
   extubation.
   -Wean sedation
   -Continue with antibiotics
   -Will need to move to CVVH today given need for volume removal in
   absence of capacity to adequately diurese with Lasix
   -Continue PSV
   2)Pneumonia-
   -Meropenem to continue
   3)BMT--For Multiple Myeloma-
   4)Acute Renal Failure
Continued worsening of creatinine and near
   anuria.
   -Will move to catheter placement today if no brisk response seen for
   diuretics
   -Lytes/Acid-Base status appears reasonable.
   4)Hypertension-
   -Atenolol to continue
   -TNG weaned to off

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ARDS, multiple myeloma, acute renal failure, hypertension, benign alteration in nutrition, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient has shown significant improvement in respiratory failure and is now able to tolerate weaning of PEEP and move to PSV support. However, the patient still retains severe oliguria and worsening renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: Despite the improvement in oxygenation, the patient is limited by significant volume overload, which is the primary barrier to extubation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is still on antibiotics for pneumonia, indicating that it may not have completely resolved.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, and there is near anuria. This suggests ongoing renal dysfunction.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled, and there is ongoing use of atenolol for this purpose.

5. Multiple Myeloma: This is an underlying condition that may contribute to the patient's overall health status and susceptibility to infections or other complications.

6. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive total input-output balance, suggesting volume overload. This needs to be managed appropriately.

7. Nutritional Status: The patient is receiving a renal diet, which is important for managing his renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man now Day +14 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +14 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   decreasing sedation and agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in
   pain.
   -continue metoprolol and amlodipine
   -consider restarted nitro gtt if hypertensive
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who is currently on day 14 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, and desensitization for meropenem due to an ESBL E. coli bacteremia. 

The patient's respiratory distress has worsened, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His PaO2:FiO2 ratio is less than 200. The BAL viral screen was positive for parainfluenza type 3, while other cultures remain negative. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with plans to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to infection and hypercarbia from parainfluenza pneumonia. Lumbar puncture results showed normal glucose and total protein levels. The patient's renal function is oliguric and likely multifactorial, possibly due to hypotension, increased lactate, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporine levels, gentamicin, recent contrast load, and acyclovir. CVVH is being continued, and all medications are being dosed for a GFR of less than 10.

The patient's anemia is significant, with a hematocrit of 20. He is being transfused for less than 21. His myeloma treatment includes cyclosporine dosing per level, with a goal around 200. 

Other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyponatremia, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, GERD, and anemia. 

The patient's medications include meropenem for E. coli bacteremia, vancomycin, micafungin, CVVH, and other immunosuppressive drugs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS.
2. Infection-related complications, including line infections and sinus infection.
3. Acyclovir-related acute renal failure.
4. Volume overload from renal failure.
5. Post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome.
6. Continued bacteremia and urinary tract infection from ESBL E. coli.
7. Poor glycemic control in the setting of infection and underlying diabetes mellitus.
8. Hypertension management.
9. Further evaluation and management of altered mental status.
10. Monitoring and management of anemia.
11. Monitoring and management of hyperlipidemia.
12. Long-term management of myeloma and immunosuppression."

   Assessment and Plan
   ICU Care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress and has undergone meropenem desensitization. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/54 mmHg to 173/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with clear lungs anteriorly but there are concerns about a potential line infection, sinus infection, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient has received various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate (CRRT), nitroglycerin, and other ICU medications. The patient's weight is currently 145 kg, with a height of 72 inches. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,718 mL, including 445 mL through PO and 1,943 mL through IVF. Output includes 1,003 mL of urine, 780 mL of NG drainage, and 30 mL of stool drainage. The respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 91. 

Physical examination reveals obesity, intubation, and sedation, with a right-sided portacath and left-sided tunneled catheter over an erythematous patch, possibly an old XRT site. The patient is tachycardic with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs), and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops are heard. The lungs are clear anteriorly, and the abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no bowel sounds. There is 1+ pitting edema on the dorsum of the feet and bilateral upper extremity edema that is non-pitting. 

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, sodium of 120 mg/dL, potassium of 5.1 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 22.6%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 68 mg/dL, creatinine of 7.0 mg/dL, glucose of 170 mg/dL, and platelet count of 68 K/uL. Other lab values include prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), as well as elevated liver enzymes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, line infection, sinus infection, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who is currently on day 14 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS. His mental status is likely multifactorial, possibly due to infection, hypercarbia related to parainfluenza pneumonia, and hyponatremia. The patient also has anemia, myeloma, hyponatremia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, GERD, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with bilateral patchy infiltrates indicating ARDS. There is a concern for volume overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction, and engraftment syndrome. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to wean PEEP and perform spontaneous breathing trials.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including infection, hypercarbia from parainfluenza pneumonia, and hyponatremia. A lumbar puncture was performed, showing no signs of infection"

The patient's BAL viral screen is positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen, but negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to various causes such as blood clot, drug-related side effects, line infection, urinary tract infection, or sinusitis. Further evaluation is needed, including LE dopplers to look for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), CT sinuses, CMV viral load testing, and consideration of pulling lines.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man now Day +14 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Fevers: blood clot versus drug-related versus line infection versus
   urinary tract infection versus sinusitis
   -LE dopplers to look for DVT
   -f/u infectious disease recs
   -CMV vL
   -consider pulling lines
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +14 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   decreasing sedation and agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in
   pain.
   -continue metoprolol and amlodipine
   -consider restarted nitro gtt if hypertensive
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old man who is currently day +14 post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma.
2. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
3. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is also evidence of parainfluenza pneumonia, as indicated by a positive viral antigen test in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
4. The patient has fevers of unknown origin, with possible causes including blood clot (DVT), drug-related reaction, line infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), or sinusitis. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.
5. The patient has altered mental status likely due to infection and hypercarbia related to parainfluenza pneumonia. Lumbar puncture results were negative for additional infection.
6. The patient has an ongoing E. coli bacteremia and UTI, which was initially treated with aztreonam and gentamicin but switched to meropenem after successful desensitization due to a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins.
7. The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability noted have had
   favorable RSBI this morning.  BP control has actually required IV
   medications for stbilization.  However, patient does have persistent
   fevers noted through to this morning with T=100.3.  We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with blood cultures negative.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal
   -Trial decrease PEEP today
   -Wean PEEP to 8, if tolerated
will mvoe to SBT
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal
   -Will discuss with renal team move to intermittent HD going forward and
   setting up schedule with possible first dialysis today.
   3)Sepsis

   desensitization with blood cultures free or organisms.  He, however,
   has had ongoing fevers without clear definition

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma and is now experiencing progressive respiratory and renal failure. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal due to persistent anuria. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well, and his respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) has improved. However, he continues to have persistent fevers, with a temperature of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis. He has been started on meropenem after desensitization, and his blood cultures are negative for organisms. Despite this, he has ongoing fevers without a clear source.

The plan for the patient's care includes continuing to support respiratory failure with low-dose Versed and fentanyl, while maintaining PSV and gradually decreasing PEEP. The patient will be moved to spontaneous breathing trials if tolerated. For acute renal failure, CVVH will continue for volume removal, and the renal team will discuss the possibility of moving to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) and setting up a schedule with a possible first dialysis today.

Regarding sepsis, the patient will continue to receive micafungin and meropenem. Re-imaging for sinus infection will be organized with interruption in CVVH timing, and the renal team will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently on day +14. He was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, and desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with limited responsiveness. He has fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. He is receiving heparin empirically for possible pulmonary embolism (PE), IV metoprolol, and various other medications.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis includes volume overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction, and engraftment syndrome. The patient's PaO2:FiO2 ratio is less than 200, indicating severe hypoxemia. The patient is being weaned off PEEP and undergoing daily pressure support trials. A spontaneous breathing trial is planned.
2. Fevers: The cause of the patient's fevers is uncertain. Potential causes include blood clot, drug-related effects, line infection, urinary tract infection, or sinusitis. Doppler examinations for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are recommended. Further infectious disease recommendations are needed, and a CT scan of the sinuses is advised.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently on day 14 of an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization due to an ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, GERD, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing rapidly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates, suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The cause could be sepsis, known parainfluenza pneumonia, volume overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction, or engraftment syndrome.

2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be attributed to various causes such as blood clots, drug-related reactions, line infections, urinary tract infections, or sinusitis. Further evaluation with LE dopplers, infectious disease recommendations, CT sinuses, and consideration of line removal may be necessary.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status likely related to infection and hypercarbia due to parainfluenza pneumonia. This could be further worsened by hyponatremia. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures remain negative for additional infection."

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem
   desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory failure: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS given P:F <200 in setting of sepsis and
   known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also
   includes volume overload from renal failure and now question of
   pulmonary embolism. Post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome
   less likely.
   -Cont to mechanically vent; unable to tolerate SBT today; retry
   tomorrow
   -Cntinue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on improved
   renal function. HD deferred in favor of CVVH given lower running BP.
   Will ultrafiltrate as BP tolerates
   # Fevers: PE (negative LENIs) versus drug-related (?meropenem despite
   desensitization) versus line infection versus sinusitis versus
   abdominal abscess
   -Appreciate ID recs
   -Continue current abx
   -CT torso
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. Will order TTE to evaluate
   for R heart strain. [**Month (only) 51**] also be able to see evidence of RV enlargement
   on CT chest w/o contrast.
   -Check diff for eos, urine eos to r/o drug fever
   -Await cx data from pulled line. Consider pulling portacath if
   continuing to spike.
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -CIS, f/u blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use metoprolol or dilt boluses; will
   start on amiodarone gtt which may also help remain in sinus rhythm
   should cardioversion become necessary
   -PE workup as above
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level (50mg IV today, recheck CSA level tomorrow
   at 9pm); goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;

   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is suggestive of ARDS. He also has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial, and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has several other medical complications, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, anemia, hyponatremia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for ARDS, which is associated with poor prognosis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, possibly due to multiple factors such as hypotension, increased lactate, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, recent contrast load, and acyclovir toxicity. CVVH is being used to manage renal function.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which needs to be managed with antiarrhythmic medication"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma. He is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and renal failure, requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume removal due to persistent anuria. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) wean well and has shown favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) in the morning. However, the patient's blood pressure stability has required IV medications for stabilization. He also has persistent fevers, and possible sources such as sinusitis and catheter seeding are being considered.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoxia in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, and there is a risk of pulmonary embolism. The patient is on low-dose Versed and Fentanyl, and PSV is being continued. The patient will continue to be supported through continued volume removal, and a trial decrease in PEEP will be attempted today with a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), but extubation is not recommended due to overnight events. The patient is also on IV heparin empirically, and a pulmonary embolism will be checked for.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and CVVH will continue for volume removal today. The renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem
   desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory failure: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS given P:F <200 in setting of sepsis and
   known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also
   includes volume overload from renal failure and now question of
   pulmonary embolism. Post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome
   less likely.
   -Cont to mechanically vent; unable to tolerate SBT today; retry
   tomorrow
   -Cntinue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on improved
   renal function. HD deferred in favor of CVVH given lower running BP.
   Will ultrafiltrate as BP tolerates
   # Fevers: PE (negative LENIs) versus drug-related (?meropenem despite
   desensitization) versus line infection versus sinusitis versus
   abdominal abscess
   -Appreciate ID recs
   -Continue current abx
   -CT torso
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. Will order TTE to evaluate
   for R heart strain. [**Month (only) 51**] also be able to see evidence of RV enlargement
   on CT chest w/o contrast.
   -Check diff for eos, urine eos to r/o drug fever
   -Await cx data from pulled line. Consider pulling portacath if
   continuing to spike.
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -CIS, f/u blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use metoprolol or dilt boluses; will
   start on amiodarone gtt which may also help remain in sinus rhythm
   should cardioversion become necessary
   -PE workup as above
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level (50mg IV today, recheck CSA level tomorrow
   at 9pm); goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per tube feed status
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Here had required
   addition of nitro gtt but currently more hypotensive.
   -Hold metoprolol and amlodipine
   -Amiodarone for afib
   -CVVH as above; will avoid large fluid shifts
   -[**Month (only) 51**] need to start pressors if unable to maintain MAP>65
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -holding duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting

   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous

   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma and was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. There is also a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) and volume overload from renal failure.

2. Fevers: The cause of the fevers is uncertain, with possible causes including PE, drug-related reactions (meropenem despite desensitization), line infection, sinusitis, or abdominal abscess. No peripheral or urinary eosinophils are present, making sinusitis less likely. Current antibiotics are being continued, and a CT torso is planned.

3. E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient had a previous UTI caused by ESBL E. coli, which was successfully treated with aztreonam. However, recent cultures have shown ESBL bacteremia. The patient has undergone successful desensitization to meropenem and is now on this antibiotic. Surveillance cultures are pending, and meropenem will be continued.

   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose but would decrease sedation further
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis

   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who has undergone a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis/hypotension, and multiple myeloma.

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute hypoxia in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, but there is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is being supported with continued volume removal through CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and plans to wean off PSV (partial liquid ventilation). Sedation will be decreased further with Versed/Fentanyl, and a trial decrease in PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to 5 for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be done.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and CVVH will continue for volume removal today. The renal team is considering moving to intermittent hemodialysis going forward.

3. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient had an episode of bacteremia caused by ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) E. coli and was treated with Meropenem after desensitization. Blood cultures are currently negative for organisms. The patient has ongoing low-grade fevers without"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has a history of multiple myeloma and underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been diagnosed with several medical complications including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, anemia, hyponatremia, ileus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, labile blood pressure, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, GERD, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. Continued support and monitoring are necessary to improve respiratory status.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has signs suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, including increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and right ventricular dilation. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to confirm and manage this condition.

3. Infection: The patient has recurrent fevers, which could indicate ongoing infection. Cultures have been obtained, but results are pending. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and the source of infection needs to be identified and treated accordingly.

4. Acute Renal"

   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma. He is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient is in the ICU and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal due to anuria. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85-182 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased sodium, potassium, and albumin levels. Imaging studies reveal no significant changes in the chest X-ray.

The patient's current problems include acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis/hypotension, multiple myeloma, and atrial fibrillation. The plan includes continuing CVVH for volume removal, weaning off mechanical ventilation, monitoring for possible pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and renal failure. He has been placed on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal due to persistent anuria. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized, and he has shown good tolerance to partial liquid ventilation (PLV) wean. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of pulmonary embolism (PE), and there is uncertainty about the underlying cause of his acute hypoxia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology and appropriate treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure. CVVH will continue to support volume removal, and the renal team is considering a transition to intermittent hemodialysis (HD).
3. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has been treated for ESBL E. coli bacteremia and started on meropenem after desensitization. Despite this, he continues to have low-grade fevers without a clear etiology. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and consider potential sources, such as drug fever or occult infection.
4. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma requires ongoing management and support in the post-BMT setting.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was admitted to the ICU for severe ARDS and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 131/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 40%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an arterial line inserted on [**2165-3-18**] and a dialysis catheter inserted on [**2165-3-21**]. The patient has been receiving various medications including amiodarone, heparin sodium, midazolam, fentanyl, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT, especially in patients with malignancy.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of stress ulcers, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant. He has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume removal. The patient also has sepsis/hypotension with ongoing low-grade fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and is suspected to have an esbl e coli bacteremia. Additionally, the patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to progressive hypoxia and respiratory distress.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and ARDS. This can result in impaired kidney function and the need for ongoing renal replacement therapy, such as CVVH.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (afib with RVR): The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation with RVR. This condition increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. Efforts are being made to control the heart rate, but it remains unstable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and acute renal failure. He is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal due to anuria. The patient has had good tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) wean and improved blood pressure stability. He has been experiencing low-grade fevers, which could be attributed to typical ICU infections such as sinusitis or catheter seeding. His respiratory failure appears to be multifactorial, with worsening acute hypoxia in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), possible pulmonary embolism (PE), parainfluenza infection, and treating for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) bacteremia. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure and sepsis/hypotension, with ongoing low-grade fevers despite being on appropriate antibiotics. Other medical conditions include hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS/volume overload: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may be caused by worsening acute hypoxia, possible PE, parainfluenza infection, and ESBL bacteremia. There is a concern for volume overload as well.

2. Acute Renal"

   Total time spent: 60
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma and subsequently developed respiratory failure, ARDS, and acute renal failure. He has been on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume removal. The patient's condition is further complicated by persistent low-grade fevers, the development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by volume overload and acute hypoxia in the setting of AF with RVR. This may require further attempts at fluid removal with CVVH and optimization for future weaning.

2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to parainfluenza pneumonia and presumed PE. Management includes continued ventilator support, broad antibacterial and antifungal treatments, and careful fluid management.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF and is currently on CVVH for volume removal. Transition to hemodialysis (HD) may be limited due to AF and RVR. Continued CVVH is planned.

4. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient had ESBL E. coli bacteremia and is now on meropenem after desensitization. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have low-grade fevers."

   Left sided subclavian line with tip terminating in probable superior
   SVC. No change in multifocal airspace opacities.
   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise from the information given:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), which can lead to respiratory failure. This is due to sepsis and known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has an increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV (right ventricular) dilation, which raises concerns for a pulmonary embolism. The TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) also shows R heart strain suggestive of PE.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, likely multifactorial in origin. Factors contributing to renal failure include hypotension in the setting of intubation, increased lactate, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin, recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Acyclovir-related ARF (acute renal failure) is at the top of the differential.

4. Infection: The patient has recurrent fevers, making it difficult to determine the source of infection. Possible sources include PE, drug-related reactions (meropenem despite desensitization), line infection, sinus"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Based on the progress note, the patient has experienced several events over the past 24 hours. The trans-thoracic echo revealed right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis, raising concern for a pulmonary embolism. As a result, the patient underwent right port removal and placement of a left subclavian line. Heparin infusion was temporarily stopped for 6 hours pre- and post-procedure.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, metoprolol, and others. His allergies include penicillins, morphine, and Dilaudid-HP.

   Imaging: [**3-25**] CXR: Right sided PICC line terminating in mid axilla.
   Left sided subclavian line with tip terminating in probable superior
   SVC. No change in multifocal airspace opacities.
   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and ARDS. The patient's current condition is critical, as indicated by the need for life support in the ICU.

The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo (TTE) which showed right ventricular (RV) dilatation and hypokinesis, concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient then went to the operating room (OR) for right port removal and placement of left subclavian line. During the procedure, heparin infusion was stopped for 6 hours pre- and post-procedure.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 116/58 to 197/102 mmHg. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 500 mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The respiratory support device is an endotracheal tube, and the mode is CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The plateau pressure is 17 cmH2O, and the compliance is 41.7 cmH2O/mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, as well as decreased platelet count and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent a bone marrow transplant. He developed an esbl e coli bacteremia, which led to progressive respiratory failure/ards in the setting of parainfluenza pneumonia and presumed pulmonary embolism. The patient also has acute renal failure, for which he is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal.

The patient's course has been further complicated by persistent low-grade fevers, development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and anasarca. The patient is currently on broad antibacterial and antifungal treatments.

The patient's current problems include acute respiratory failure, ARDS, parainfluenza pneumonia, presumed pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, and ileus.

The plan includes continuing broad antibacterial and antifungal treatments, moving towards pressure support weans, attempting fluid removal with CVVH as the blood pressure allows, optimizing for future wean, continuing IV heparin empirically, transitioning to hemodialysis in the near future, pursuing a tunnel line, and addressing other ongoing issues.

The patient's condition is described as critically ill."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He presented with sepsis due to an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli bacteremia. The patient developed progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of parainfluenza pneumonia (PNA) and presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has acute renal failure (ARF) on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is slowly improving. Continue broad antibiotic and antifungal treatment. Move towards pressure support weans on the ventilator. Attempt fluid removal with CVVH as blood pressure allows to better optimize for future wean. Continue intravenous heparin for presumed PE.
2. ARF: Continue CVVH for volume removal. Renal function will likely transition to hemodialysis (HD) in the near future. Pursue tunnel line placement for prolonged dialysis needs.
3. Sepsis: Continued low-grade fevers without additional etiology identified despite broad coverage. Now with temperatures masked by CVVH. Consider drug fever vs occult ICU infection such as sinusitis vs possible seeding of catheters. All old lines and port are now out. Continue Micafungin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, hypoxia, and the need for meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient also had parainfluenza pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation, raising concerns for pulmonary embolism. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS and known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. There is also a concern for volume overload from renal failure and possible pulmonary embolism. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently experiencing AFIB with rapid ventricular response. Treatment includes low-dose diltiazem and amiodarone, but the patient's heart rate remains elevated.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status has been improving but recently failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to oversedation or myopathy. Sedation is being reduced prior to a second trial of PSV.
3. Sepsis/ESBL E. coli Bacteremia: The patient had a previous UTI caused by ESBL E. coli, which was cleared with aztreonam. He is currently on meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for at least a two-week course due to persistent bacteremia.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely multifactorial in origin. Acyclovir-related ARF is suspected due to numerous crystals in the urine sediment. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being continued, and medications are being adjusted for a GFR of approximately 30.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, and improvement is likely due to CVVH fluid shifts. Blood transfusions are being considered for a hematocrit below 21.
6. Myeloma: The patient underwent stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma. Medications such as cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil are being administered per BMT recommendations.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is improving and is likely related to SIADH secondary to pain and/or pneumonia.
8. Ileus: The patient has high residuals and poor nutritional status, making tube feeding difficult. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been started.
9. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose control is challenging due to infection, underlying diabetes, and steroids.
10. Depression: The patient has a history of major depression and requires medication, but duloxetine is being withheld"

   Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also includes volume overload from renal failure
   and likely question of pulmonary embolism. Concern for PE with
   increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation.
   -Pesp staus improving: transition to pressure support
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on volume
   removal: continue CVVH

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). He is currently in the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient also has parainfluenza pneumonia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and potential pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 119 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance is 8, and the plateau pressure is 21 cmH2O.

The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, midline, and multi-lumen catheter. He is receiving various medications, including IV lopressor, metoprolol, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.

The patient's laboratory results show leukoc"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma and subsequently developed an Escherichia coli bacteremia with progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib), presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a high clinical suspicion of PE, and the use of heparin for anticoagulation is appropriate. However, there is still a risk of developing DVT or experiencing further PEs.
3. Infection: The patient has ongoing low-grade fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms of infection is crucial.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require transition to hemodialysis soon. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib is not well-controlled, making rate control a concern. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and adjusting medication dosages as needed is important.
6. Multiple myeloma progression: Although"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and subsequently developed bacteremia with an antibiotic-resistant strain of E. coli. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for volume removal and is expected to transition to hemodialysis in the near future. The patient's nutrition is poor, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He also has an ileus and is unable to take oral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration or complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to progressive lung injury and respiratory failure. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur.
3. Parainfluenza Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is suspected to have parainfluenza pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory function and overall condition.
4. Presumed Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at high risk for pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, multiple comorbidities, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 105/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory support, and receiving medications such as heparin, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, micafungin, and meropenem. There is a mention of a coag-negative staph infection from a wound swab of the port. The patient's immune system may be compromised due to multiple myeloma and ongoing treatments, making him more susceptible to infections.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and his kidney function tests show elevated levels of creatinine and BUN. The patient may require ongoing dialysis support to manage his renal function.
3. ARDS: The patient has a diagnosis of ARDS, which is characterized by acute lung injury. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function. There is a risk of further"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient also has parainfluenza pneumonia, new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and concerns for pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS and parainfluenza pneumonia, sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), AFIB with right ventricular strain suggesting PE, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, myeloma, hyponatremia, ileus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and glaucoma.

The patient is receiving various treatments including CVVH (continuous venovenous hemofiltration), meropenem, vancomycin, micafungin, metoprolol, heparin gtt (continuous infusion), TPN (total parenteral nutrition), regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic medications such as DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis/bacteremia, PE, ARF,"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.

   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient also has parainfluenza pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), and continued volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has complex respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE, and continued volume overload. The plan is to continue hepatic flow, switch sedation from fentanyl/midazolam to propofol for controlled weaning, and continue CVVH.

2. Sepsis/E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient has ongoing sepsis and E. coli bacteremia with a urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently on meropenem after desensitization. His hemodynamics vary widely due to agitation, atrial fibrillation, and underlying infection. The plan is to continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for at least a two-week course until April 1st. Blood and line cultures will be followed, and ID"

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis with E. coli bacteremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, anemia, myeloma, ileus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/72 mmHg to 186/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and irregular atrial fibrillation. The patient is intubated and sedated, with grimacing to pain. Physical examination reveals mild coarse breath sounds, 1+ pitting edema on the dorsum of feet, and upper extremities bilaterally edematous but non-pitting.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; Nightly
   Cyclosporine dosing per BMT
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Patient continues to have ileus, exacerbated by narcotics
   (fenatnyl). No obstruction per KUB
   -On TPN
   - D/C fentanyl (for propofol)
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient also has parainfluenza pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), and continues to have volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complex, with multiple etiologies including ARDS, parainfluenza pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE, and continued volume overload. The patient requires close monitoring and ongoing respiratory support.
2. Sepsis/E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient is currently on meropenem after desensitization. His hemodynamics vary wildly due to agitation, atrial fibrillation, and underlying infection. It is crucial to continue the antibiotic therapy and monitor for any signs of sepsis or infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient requires metoprolol IV to control his heart rate. If he is unable to tolerate metoprolol, amiodarone can be used.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   multifactorial respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia and mental
   status changes.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   status no longer a factor
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE- hold for
   Femoral line removal, HD line placement
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; Nightly
   Cyclosporine dosing per BMT
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Patient continues to have ileus, exacerbated by narcotics
   (fenatnyl). No obstruction per KUB
   -On TPN
   - D/C fentanyl (for propofol)
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient has been experiencing volatile blood pressures, ranging from the 70s to 170s systolic, which has made it difficult to establish a hemodynamic line. CSA 25mg IV was administered, and the patient's sedation was switched from fentanyl/midazolam to propofol to allow for more controlled weaning and assessment of mental status.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is being treated with metoprolol. He has oliguric renal failure, possibly due to sepsis/hypotension and acyclovir-related complications. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is ongoing, and the patient is scheduled for a hemodialysis (HD) line placement today.

The patient's anemia is improving, likely due to CVVH fluid shifts. His myeloma status post SCT requires ongoing management with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient also has an ileus, which is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; Nightly
   Cyclosporine dosing per BMT
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Patient continues to have ileus, exacerbated by narcotics
   (fenatnyl). No obstruction per KUB
   -On TPN
   - D/C fentanyl (for propofol)
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient also had parainfluenza pneumonia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's current medical conditions and treatment plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has complex respiratory failure caused by ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE, and volume overload. He is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and will continue with propofol sedation to assess mental status.
2. Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient is on meropenem after desensitization. His hemodynamics vary widely due to agitation, AFIB, and underlying infection. He will continue with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for at least a two-week course.
3. AFIB with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient is being treated with metoprolol to control his heart rate. If he cannot tolerate metoprolol, amiodarone can be used.
4. Acute renal failure ("

","The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis with E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure, anemia, and ileus.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm with irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 127/57 mmHg to 194/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated, not arousable to voice, and grimacing to pain.

Physical examination reveals right-sided wound from port cath removal, inability to assess jugular venous distention (JVD) due to obesity, tachycardia with an irregular rhythm, normal S1/S2 heart sounds, mildly coarse breath sounds in the lungs, obesity with soft abdomen, no hepatosplenomegaly (HSM), and 1+ pitting edema on the dorsum of the feet, as well as non-pitting edema in the upper extremities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include the placement of a tunnelled L IJ HD line, which was oozing from the site requiring pressure. The patient was placed back on AC with an increase in propofol as he was coughing and occluding the HD line. Hep gtt was stopped around 10 pm due to oozing and restarted in the morning.

Allergies include penicillins, rash; anaphylaxis, morphine, nausea/vomiting, and dilaudid-Hp (Injection) (Hydromorphone Hcl/Pf), nausea/vomiting.

Last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/28/2165 at 11:25 AM, micafungin on 03/29/2165 at 04:00 PM, and meropenem on 03/29/2165 at 08:00 PM.

Infusions include propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min, metoprolol on 03/30/2165 at 04:00 AM, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.7°C (99.8°F) and current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 88 bpm with a range of 79-99 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 127/57 mmHg to 194/80 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 17-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's weight is currently 129.8 kg and height is 72 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg with a range of 2-7 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,387 mL and total output of 1,609 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,009 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PS) of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   multifactorial respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia and mental
   status changes.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   status no longer a factor.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE- hold for
   Femoral line removal, HD line placement
   - Continue Propofol sedation.
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 5mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Holding CVVH today pending renal recs.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   - Switch to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop overnight possibly from fluid collection.  No
   evidence of bleed but low threshold for scan given his heparin gtt.
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <25
   - With Hct drop, CT scan for RP bleed or thigh hematoma
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine 25mg IV BID
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Return of bowel sounds today, no stooling yet.
   -On TPN
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status
   Improving overall with decreased FIO2 requirements and resolution of
   sepsis/stable hemodynamics off pressors.  Oxygenation has improved with
   volume removal. Primary barrier to extubation now is MS which is likely
   related to sedation.  No acute cns process on head CT. Is overbreathing
   vent while on ACV but has poorly tolerated PSW.  Continue to reattempt
   weans with lightening sedation. Will c/s pysch per BMT to inquire about
   discontinuation of prior PO psych meds contributing.  If little
   progress over next several days, would consider possibility of trach
   placement .  Remains on IV heparin for presumed PE.
   Suspect that decrease in hct may be related to volume shifts as trended
   down since CVVH on hold. Hct had bumped approp after transfusion on
   [**3-27**]. No evidence of active bleed but given heparin gtt RP bleed on
   ddx.   Follow serial h/h--if cont drop would check CT abd to r/o rp
   bleed and hold heparin.  Restart CVVH as per renal. To get tunnel line
   placement today.
   Continue Micafungin/Meropenem.  Vanco for CNS line infection. Now AF.
   Improved rate control on metoprolol IV and dig with improvement in
   labile BP. BMT recs in post BMT Rx, monitoring of cyclo levels daily
   and checking daily lfts.  Ileus
slowly improving since d/c narcotics as
   now with + BS and flatus.  Remains NPO on TPN--abd softer and now with
   BS.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with a complex etiology including ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible PE, volume overload/anasarca, sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, anemia, and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and possible PE, which can lead to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, ventilation, and respiratory effort is necessary. If necessary, the patient may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis/E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient is currently being treated with meropenem for E. coli bacteremia and UTI. Monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and urine output is essential. If the patient's condition worsens, additional antibiotics may be required.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient is receiving metoprolol to control his heart rate. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate and rhythm is necessary. If the patient is unable to tolerate metoprolol, amiodarone can be considered.

   and mental status changes.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   overload is likely the biggest impediments to extubation currently.  He
   has been on empiric treatment for PE,  but heparin gtt has been off
   because of oozing from recent tunnelled catheter.  LENIs did not show
   DVT.
   - TTE tomorrow  to re-evaluate for RV strain to determine if long-term
   anticoagulation is necessary
   - restart heparin gtt at previous rate, no bolus
   - continue pressure support ventilation for now and wean as tolerated
   - continue to remove volume as tolerated (would like to remove 4-5L
   today)
   - attempt to extubate in the upcoming 1-2 days
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  WBC count stable.  Can not trust absence of fevers
   given CVVH.  Port removed [**3-25**] growing coagulase negative staph.
   - Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   - CIS
   - f/u blood / line cultures
   - continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   - f/u  ID recs
   - follow lactate
   # Afib with RVR:  On metoprolol and digoxin, with persistently elevated
   HR.  Possible contributions from ? intravascular volume depletion as
   well as pain/anxiety.
   - continue metoprolol at  current dose
   - increase digoxin to .125 mg/day (discussed with renal)
   - follow HR
   - treat pain
   # ARF: Urine output improving.  Cause is multifactorial with
   Sepsis/hypotension and Acyclovir related.
   - Continue CVVH
   - continue to hold acyclovir
   - Switched to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hematocrit dropped [**3-29**], received 2 units pRBC, has been
   stable 25-26 since then.  Likely [**12-17**] fluid shifts.  No evidence of
   bleed but low threshold for scan.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - guiaic all stools
   - transfuse for <25
   - If has another Hct drop, would consider CT scan for RP bleed or thigh
   hematoma
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - Dose cyclosporine 25mg IV BID; clarify with BMT how often levels
   should be checked
   - f/u BMT recs
   - holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   - nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   - continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil
   - avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Return of bowel sounds, with some stooling; perhaps improved
   b/c  fentanyl drip weaned
   -On TPN
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma with respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), E. coli bacteremia, and mental status changes. The patient has several medical complications that need attention.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has complex etiology including ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible PE, and volume overload. The main impediment to extubation is the volume overload. The plan includes restarting heparin gtt at previous rate without bolus, continuing pressure support ventilation, removing volume as tolerated, and attempting extubation in the upcoming 1-2 days.

2. Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient is currently on meropenem after desensitization. WBC count is stable, but cannot trust absence of fevers given CVVH. The plan includes continuing meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for at least a two-week course until 4/1.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has persistent elevated heart rate despite being on metoprolol and digoxin. Possible contributions from intravascular volume depletion as well as pain/anxiety are considered. The plan includes continuing metoprolol at the current dose, increasing digoxin to 0.125 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), E. coli bacteremia, and mental status changes. The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, myeloma, ileus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, possible PE, and volume overload. These conditions can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis/E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient has been treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. Despite this, there are no organisms in the cultures. The sepsis and bacteremia can worsen if the infection does not respond to the current antibiotic regimen.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin for atrial fibrillation with RVR. If the medications are ineffective or if the patient develops any complications related to this arrhythmia, it could lead to hemodynamic instability.
4. Acute Renal"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, benign; diabetes mellitus type II; renal failure, acute; multiple myeloma (cancer, malignant neoplasm); and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, acute lung injury). The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He continues to have significant fluid requirements due to ongoing losses. Propofol infusion has been increased for sedation. Vancomycin will be discontinued tomorrow, and heparin will be restarted. Digoxin dose has been increased, which has improved right ventricular function.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a regular rhythm. Weight is 129.8 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 10,678 mL and total output of 18,588 mL, resulting in a deficit of -7,910 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 650 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   probably normal (LVEF>55%). RV size is difficult to assess. The RV has
   borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-25**], no
   definite change.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), treated E. coli
   bacteremia and mental status changes.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation will be discussed today with his oncology team and
   family.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run slightly negative today given
   stabilization of blood pressures
   - Failed spontaneous breathing trial today: off all sedation patient
   became hypertensive to 190/110
s, more tachypneic and tachycardic.
   Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board with plan.  IP evaluated
   patient
 unable to do because of patient
s anatomy and h/o prior
   trach; CT surgery to see patient in the AM for OR placement of trach
   - Continue heparin gtt for now, turn off prior to trach
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Continue Micafungin until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt
   spiking low grade fevers today, no antibiotics restarted.
   - Plan to remove right wrist A line.  L sided A line attempted today
   without success.  Re-attempt new Aline placement in the AM.
   - Consider removing L subclavian given erythema around insertion site.
   However, will need to establish central access prior to this (likely
   with additional PICC placement given that patient requires multiple
   ports for meds, TPN, etc.)
   - Re-checking CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on
   Acyclovir for awhile)
   # Afib with RVR:  Improved control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   # Psych: Psych not recommending starting anti-depressant urgently given
   patient
s critical status.
   - Low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4 prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses
   needed, consider Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up to 20mg/day as needed for
   agitation.
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal even
   today, adding fluid back as needed.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Switched to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hct Holding after [**3-30**] transfusion
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   BMT Recs: Cyclosporine, MMF
   # Diarrhea:  formerly Ileus, now stooling, on TPN.  C. diff negative
   times two, third pending.  Consider addition of Flagyl if diarrhea
   worsens and patient  becomes unstable.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple medical problems including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, multiple myeloma, and obesity. The patient underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma and subsequently developed respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia, and mental status changes. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy planned, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have mixed etiology respiratory failure, including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and volume overload. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function leading to worsening respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis/E. coli Bacteremia and Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient completed a course of meropenem and vancomycin but is still receiving Micafungin. There is a risk of persistent or recurrent infection, which can lead to sepsis and complications such as septic shock.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's heart rate remains elevated despite treatment with metoprolol and digoxin. The risk of arrhythmia-related complications, such as stroke, persists if"

   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   probably normal (LVEF>55%). RV size is difficult to assess. The RV has
   borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-25**], no
   definite change.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), treated E. coli
   bacteremia and mental status changes.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation is planned as the patient failed SBT yesterday and
   has been intubated for a prolonged period of time.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run slightly negative given stabilization
   of blood pressures
   - Failed spontaneous breathing trial yesterday: off all sedation
   patient became hypertensive to 190/110
s, more tachypneic and
   tachycardic.  Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board with plan.  IP
   evaluated patient
 unable to do because of patient
s difficult anatomy
   and h/o prior trach; Csurg to see patient for placement of trach
   - Continue heparin gtt for now
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be
   continued until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt spiking low grade fevers
   yesterday, none overnight.  No broad antibiotics restarted. Suspect low
   grade fevers related to multiple lines, including A line that appeared
   erythematous on the right.
   - A line removed overnight.  Follow up tip culture.
   - Multiple attempts to replace L sided A line without success.
   Re-attempt new Aline placement in the AM.
   - Consider removing L subclavian given erythema around insertion site.
   However, will need to establish central access prior to this (PICC
   nurse has seen and evaulated patient, and currently another PICC would
   not be a viable option for this patient given history of multiple
   ports, tunneled caths, and number of lines in place currently) .
   Patient requires multiple ports for meds, TPN, etc.
   - f/u CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on Acyclovir
   for awhile)
   # Afib with RVR:  Improved control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   # Psych: Psych not recommending starting anti-depressant urgently given
   patient
s critical status.
   - Low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4 prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses
   needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal
   slightly negative today.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Switched to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hct Holding after [**3-30**] transfusion
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   BMT Recs: Cyclosporine, MMF
   # Diarrhea:  formerly Ileus, now stooling, on TPN.  C. diff negative
   times two, third pending.  Consider addition of Flagyl if diarrhea
   worsens and patient  becomes unstable.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, multiple myeloma (cancer), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line and multi-lumen line. There were plans for a tracheostomy but it has not been performed yet. The patient's renal function is being considered for change to hemodialysis from continuous veno-venous hemofiltration.

Allergies include penicillins, causing anaphylaxis, and morphine, causing nausea/vomiting.

Medications currently infusing include heparin sodium at 1,500 units/hour and lansoprazole. Other medications include metoprolol and heparin sodium.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/47 mmHg to 140/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, but
   oxygenation is much improved.  Failed spontaneous breathing trial : off

   of diaphragmatic weakness.  Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board
   with plan.  Tracheostomy as a means of bridging extubation is planned
   as the patient failed SBT and has been intubated for a prolonged period
   of time.
   - As per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],  tracheostomy tomorrow at bedside with assistance
   from anesthesia
   - Continue heparin gtt for now for empiric Tx of PE as repeat echo
   confirmed RV strain.
   - Check NIF, continue MDIs
   - check benzo level to assess if still in system
   - decrease PSV to 8 from 10, keep peep at 8, currently over-ventilating
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be
   continued until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt spiking low grade fevers
   48 hours ago, none overnight.  No broad antibiotics restarted. Suspect
   low grade fevers related to multiple lines, including A line that
   appeared erythematous on the right.
   - A line removed and replaced.  Follow up tip culture.
   - Replaced left subclavian (not sent for Cx) with right IJ.  Patient
   requires multiple ports for meds, TPN, etc.
   - f/u CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on Acyclovir
   for awhile)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), paraflu, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and mental status changes that have prevented weaning from mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (AF), renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple myeloma. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, as he has ARDS, paraflu infection, and possible PE. The patient's oxygenation has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy has been planned to bridge extubation since the patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial.
2. Sepsis/E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient completed a course of antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia and UTI but is now experiencing low-grade fevers. His central line appears erythematous, and it has been removed and replaced. Follow-up cultures are pending.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is being managed with metoprolol and digoxin. His digoxin level needs to be monitored.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), s/p completed course
   for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; mental status changes
   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now pursuing
   tracheostomy.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation is planned as the patient failed SBT yesterday and
   has been intubated for a prolonged period of time.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run slightly negative given stabilization
   of blood pressures
   - Failed spontaneous breathing trial yesterday: off all sedation
   patient became hypertensive to 190/110
s, more tachypneic and
   tachycardic.  Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board with plan.  IP
   evaluated patient
 unable to do because of patient
s difficult anatomy
   and h/o prior trach; Csurg to see patient for placement of trach
   tomorrow.
   - Continue heparin gtt for now for empiric Tx of PE as repeat echo
   confirmed RV strain.
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be
   continued until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt spiking low grade fevers
   yesterday, none overnight.  No broad antibiotics restarted. Suspect low
   grade fevers related to multiple lines, including A line that appeared
   erythematous on the right.
   - A line removed and replaced.  Follow up tip culture.
   - Replace left subclavian with right IJ.  Patient requires multiple
   ports for meds, TPN, etc.
   - f/u CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on Acyclovir
   for awhile)
   - follow blood and urine Cx
   # Afib with RVR:  Improved control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - check dig level
   # Psych: Psych not recommending starting anti-depressant urgently given
   patient
s critical status.
   - Low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4 prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses
   needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal
   negative 1-2 L today.
   - Continue CVVH; D/W reanl re switch to HD
   # Anemia: Hct Holding after [**3-30**] transfusion
   - monitor [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - BMT Recs: Cyclosporine, MMF

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is now experiencing respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), paraflu infection, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staphylococcal line infection. The patient has mental status changes that make weaning off mechanical ventilation difficult, and a tracheostomy is planned. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Mixed etiology respiratory failure (ARDS, paraflu, possible PE)
- Volume overload
- Negative fluid balance due to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)
- Hypertension and tachycardia
- Failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday
- Plan to place tracheostomy
- Repeat echo confirmed right ventricular strain, suggesting PE
- Completed course of meropenem and vancomycin for E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI)
- Continuing Micafungin until blood glucan levels return negative
- Low-grade fevers, possibly related to multiple lines
- A line removed and replaced
- Left subclavian replaced with right internal jugular (IJ) line
- Multiple ports needed for medications and total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
- Follow-up CMV viral load and blood/urine cultures

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has a history of respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Paraflu 3 PNA, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and mental status changes precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently being prepared for a tracheostomy due to failed spontaneous breathing trial and diaphragmatic weakness. 

The patient also has sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI), for which he completed a course of meropenem and vancomycin. He is still on Micafungin until the Bglucan returns negative. The patient is showing low-grade fevers, which may be related to multiple lines, including an erythematous arterial line on the right. 

Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR), improved control with metoprolol and digoxin. His psychiatric status is critical, and he is currently not recommended for starting antidepressants urgently. However, low-dose Zyprexa is being used for agitation. 

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), with urine output flat and a large volume removal yesterday. The goal is negative 1-2 liters today. CVVH and dialysis are being continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, and multiple myeloma. He is febrile and has positive beta-glucan. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), paraflu, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). He has failed a spontaneous breathing trial and underwent tracheostomy. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to ARDS, paraflu, and possible PE. Monitoring his oxygen saturation, ventilator settings, and any signs of worsening respiratory distress is crucial.
2. Sepsis: The patient's febrile response and positive beta-glucan indicate an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, infection parameters, and response to antibiotics is necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by urine output effectively zero. Monitoring renal function tests and adjusting medications accordingly is important.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is low. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is recommended.
5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient underwent SCT for multiple myel"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma.
- He has respiratory failure due to ARDS (from ESBL bacteremia), Paraflu 3 PNA, and PE, which has improved.
- The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial and required tracheostomy.
- He is febrile post-procedure and has a positive beta-glucan.
- He is on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off sedation.
- He is on various medications including cyclosporin, metoprolol, digoxin, micafungin, and others.
- He has acute renal failure (ARF) with urine output effectively zero.
- He is anemic with a holding hematocrit after a recent transfusion.
- He underwent an SCT for multiple myeloma.
- He has a history of hypertension, benign; alteration in nutrition; diabetes mellitus (DM), type II; and cancer (malignant neoplasm).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of ARDS and respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening lung function.
2. Infection: The patient is febrile and has a positive beta-glucan, indicating a possible fungal infection. He also has a history of E. coli bacteremia and line infection. There is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to the central lines and catheters.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output is effectively zero, suggesting worsening renal function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is holding after a recent transfusion, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and cardiovascular complications.
5. Multiple myeloma: The patient underwent SCT for multiple myeloma. There is a risk of disease progression or relapse.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, which may be difficult to control in the setting of infection and critical illness. Poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.

The Answer is: The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, infection, acute renal failure, anemia, multiple myeloma, and diabetes mellitus."

   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), s/p completed course
   for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; mental status changes
   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now s/p tracheostomy.
   Febrile this AM post procedure and with positve beta-glucan.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy after failing multiple
   SBTs [**12-17**] hypertension, tachypneia, tachycardia.  Initial respiratory
   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.
   - Continue heparin gtt although repeat echo was without impressive
   evidence of strain
   - Consider risk/benefits of CTA repeat to evaluate for PE; will discuss
   with renal
   - CT lungs (with or without contrast) to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - back on trach collar as tolerated today
   # Fevers; previous Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia:  He continues to be
   febrile.  Completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Off all
   antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be continued given positibe
   beta-glucan. Beta glucan now positive and of unclear significance
   ID any candididal mucosal infxn could cause this. Galactomannam
   pending.  CMV VL negative.  Another potential source of fever is R
   tunnelled HD line that looks erythematous and possibly infected.
   - change HD line
   - consider vancomycin for possible line infection
   - CT lungs
   - CT abdomen/pelvis for ? abscess (though would prefer to avoid
   contrast given hx of contrast-induced ARF)
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan

   - f/u dig level
   - anticoagulated with heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Head CT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output  effectively
   zero.  Large volume removal yesterday by CVVH which is now off.
   Starting HD today.
   - avoid IV contrast if possible.
   # Anemia: Hct Holding after [**3-30**] transfusion
   - monitor [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which initially included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Paraflu infection, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has completed treatment for E. coli bacteremia and staphylococcal epinephrine line infection. He also has mental status changes, febrile, and positive beta-glucan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial respiratory failure was secondary to ARDS, Paraflu infection, and possible PE. Currently, he is much improved but still requires mechanical ventilation support through tracheostomy. He needs to be monitored closely for any signs of deterioration.
2. Fevers: The patient continues to be febrile despite completing a course of antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia. He is currently on micafungin due to positive beta-glucan. Another potential source of fever is the tunneled hemodialysis line that appears erythematous and possibly infected.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has good rate control with metoprolol and digoxin. He is anticoagulated with heparin gtt.
4. Altered mental status: The patient is not waking up despite being off all sedation. A head CT has been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has a history of respiratory failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, and multiple myeloma. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fevers, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, anemia, and diarrhea. He is currently on various medications including heparin, metoprolol, micafungin, and others. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated platelet count. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 503, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 9.5 L/min. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and current respiratory distress may lead to further deterioration in lung function and the need for assisted ventilation or mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's febrile response and positive beta-glucan indicate a possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma and is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, Paraflu, and possible PE. He has completed a course of antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia and staphylococcal line infection. The patient has mental status changes that prevent him from weaning off mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy.

The patient has been febrile this morning post-procedure and has a positive beta-glucan. He has respiratory failure secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacteremia), Paraflu 3 PNA, and PE, which has significantly improved. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial initially because he was apneic and later became hypertensive to 190/110, more tachypneic, and tachycardic off sedation. The patient displayed paradoxical breathing movements suggestive of diaphragmatic weakness. 

The patient is on heparin gtt for empiric treatment of PE, as a repeat echo confirmed RV strain. He is also on MDIs and the goal is to have PSV=5/PEEP=0 in the afternoon.

The patient's fevers are likely due to previous sepsis/E. coli bacteremia, for which he completed a course of meropenem and vancomycin. He is currently off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has a history of respiratory failure (ARDS), sepsis secondary to E. coli bacteremia, and a staphylococcus epidermidis line infection. The patient also has mental status changes, making it difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation. He recently underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy and has been febrile for the past two days with a positive beta-glucan test. Other potential sources of fever include a tunneled hemodialysis line that appears erythematous and possibly infected, as well as a possible abscess in the lungs or abdomen.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Currently, he is much improved but still requires mechanical ventilation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which could be related to his respiratory failure, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), s/p completed course
   for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; mental status changes
   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now s/p tracheostomy.
   Now with fevers and positve beta-glucan.
   # Fevers & Leukocytosis:   Previously he had  sepsis secondary to ESBL
   for which he completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Low grade
   fevers overnight. Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is being
   continued given positive beta-glucan. Beta glucan now positive and of
   unclear significance
per ID any candididal mucosal infxn could cause
   this. Galactomannam pending. Currently on a line holiday.
   - consider vancomycin for possible line infection
   - F/U CT Torso final read
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy after failing multiple
   SBTs [**12-17**] hypertension, tachypneia, tachycardia.  Initial respiratory
   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.
   - Continue heparin gtt although repeat echo was without impressive
   evidence of strain
   - F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - back on trach collar as tolerated today
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level
   - anticoagulated with heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Head CT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output  effectively
   zero.  Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs
   - daily cyclosporin levels.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

The patient's medical conditions include:
1. Fevers & Leukocytosis: The patient had sepsis due to ESBL-producing bacteria, for which he completed a course of antibiotics. He is currently experiencing low-grade fevers and has a positive beta-glucan, indicating a possible fungal infection. Further investigations, including galactomannan and culture data, are pending. The patient may require vancomycin for a possible line infection.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status.
   He has had low-grade temperatures overnight but a concerning 3 point
   Hct drop.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess:  The patient has a L sided collection in
   his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that
   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  However, he has other possible causes
   for leukocytosis.
   - F/U CT Torso final read
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   - Contact IR to consider draining abscess vs. hematoma
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest
  Still concerned for
   ARDS and ? PE.   Still not awake despite no sedation.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - F/U Head CT, considering MRI tomorrow if no improvement
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs
   - daily cyclosporin levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. He has respiratory failure, persistent altered mental status, ileopsoas hematoma/abscess, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's health progress includes febrile events, tunnelled line pulled, and a CT scan showing a pelvic ileopsoas abscess or hematoma. He is on various medications including heparin, metoprolol, micafungin, and more. The patient's vital signs show fever, altered mental status, and a drop in hematocrit level. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a left-sided collection in the ileopsoas muscle that could be either a hematoma or abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to persistent altered mental status and the possibility of ARDS and pulmonary embolism. Tracheostomy and tracheal mask ventilation have been implemented.
2. Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess: The presence of a left-sided collection in the ileopsoas muscle needs further evaluation. It could be a hematoma or abscess. The drop"

   opacities
   and nodules of both lungs. Differential diagnoses include infectious
   and
   inflammatory conditions.
   3. Interval resolution of small bilateral pleural effusion.
   NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage, or
   infarction is noted. Prominent CSF space in the left side of the
   posterior
   fossa iws most likely enlarged cisterna magna and less likely an
   arachnoid
   cyst. The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with
   involutional changes. Small periventricular white matter hypodensities
   are
   compatible with chronic microvascular infarction. The patient is status
   post
   right mastoidectomy. Moderate mucosal thickening and/or inspissated
   secretions within the sphenoid, ethmoid, bilateral maxillary and
   frontal
   sinuses are unchanged.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess: The patient has a left-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is either a hematoma or abscess. Given the patient's Hct drop, he is on heparin gtt for PE, and his WBC is decreasing but still has low-grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have a hematoma rather than abscess. However, other possible causes for leukocytosis should be considered.

2. Low-grade fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and leukocytosis. Cultures are pending, and the patient is on micafungin due to a positive glucan and galactomannan. Empirical coverage with vancomycin and levofloxacin was started on [**4-7**].

3. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to struggle with respiratory failure, which may be due to ARDS and/or a possible pulmonary embolism. Tracheostomy and trach mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation are being used.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute lung injury. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/77 mmHg to 185/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set FiO2 at 30%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and PS of 8 cmH2O. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal imaging findings including a new blurring of the left heart border on chest X-ray and hypodense lesions in the left iliacus muscle with possible hematoma or abscess on CT torso/LE.

The patient's medical history indicates recent infections, including a negative CMV viral load and negative tunnel catheter swab. The patient's nutritional status is altered, and he has a history of benign hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II.

   his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that
   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.  However, he has other possible causes for leukocytosis.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Low grade fevers/ Leukocytosis: On 48 hour line holiday per BMT until
   tommorrow morning. [**Last Name (un) **] and swab of site have pending cultures. CT
   torso thigh and head have suggested no other source. Pt continues to be
   on micafungin given + glucan (non-specific) and pending galactomannam.
   - continue VANCO/LEVO (started on [**4-7**] empirically).
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
 Original etiology
   =  ARDS (from ESBL sepsis), Paraflu PNA, and ? PE.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - F/U Head CT, consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.  Off HD, phos has
   risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours
   - Will d/w nutrition re: concentration of TF
s to limit free water.
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing?
   - daily cyclosporin levels.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure (ARDS), ileopsoas hematoma/abscess, low-grade fevers/leukocytosis, and altered mental status. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, and multiple myeloma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 133/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess: The patient has a left-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is either a hematoma or abscess. Given the patient's low hematocrit levels, he is on heparin drip for pulmonary embolism, and his white blood cell count is decreasing but still shows low-grade temperatures, it appears to be a hematoma rather than an abscess. However, there is a concern for abscess formation, and further evaluation is needed.

2. Low-Grade Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has ongoing low-grade fevers and leukocytosis. Empiric"

   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   new L psoas hematoma.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess:  The patient has a L sided collection in
   his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that
   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.  However, he has other possible causes for leukocytosis.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis, continuing Micafungin
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.  Off HD, phos has
   risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours
   - Will d/w nutrition re: concentration of TF

   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
 Original etiology
   =  ARDS (from ESBL sepsis), Paraflu PNA, and ? PE.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - F/U Head CT, consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing?
   - daily cyclosporin levels.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, multiple myeloma, and a history of anemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, antibiotics, and blood products.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which can lead to complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if not properly managed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and a decrease in urine output, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This could progress to acute kidney injury if not addressed promptly.
3. Infection: The presence of positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible ongoing infection. This needs to be treated appropriately to prevent further complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of acute anemia secondary to blood loss indicates a risk of ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to prevent exacerbation of bleeding events.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation requires monitoring for potential complications like stroke or heart failure.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   developing L psoas hematoma.
   # Altered mental status: Patient
s mental status improving marginally
   now several days off sedation (but also off HD).  He is now opening his
   eyes to voice, but does not yet follow commands.  Given his
   immunosuppression, he is more susceptible to CNS infections, however
   his slow improvement is staying our hand at further intervention at
   this time.  Largest concerns would be CNS infection or status
   epilepticus (non-convulsive). He was seen by psych not recommending
   starting anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  The patient has a L sided collection in his
   ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that his
   Hct has dropped, he was on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis (7 day course), continuing
   Micafungin
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Electrolyte derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.
   Off HD, phos has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer
   increased.
   - Place HD Line
   - Restart HD once line in place
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been improving marginally after being off sedation for several days. However, he still does not follow commands. Given his immunosuppression, there is a concern for central nervous system (CNS) infections or non-convulsive status epilepticus. An MRI of the head is recommended if there is no improvement.

2. Ileopsoas hematoma: The patient has a left-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that appears to be a hematoma rather than an abscess. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped, and he was on heparin for possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The white blood cell count (WBC) is decreasing, but low-grade temperatures are still present. Interventional radiology (IR) suggests that attempting to drain the collection would be contraindicated as it could cause further bleeding and possible seeding.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient possibly had contrast-induced ARF initially. Urine output is negligible, and electrolyte derangements are increasing. The patient is due for hemodialysis (HD) line placement today and will need to restart HD once the line is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) on [**2165-3-8**]. He has been experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, Paraflu PNA, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as an E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermis line infection. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been improving marginally after being off sedation for several days. However, he still does not follow commands. There is a concern for central nervous system (CNS) infections or non-convulsive status epilepticus. An MRI may be considered if there is no improvement.

2. Ileopsoas Hematoma: The patient has a left-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle, which appears to be a hematoma rather than an abscess. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has dropped, and he was on heparin for the possibility of PE. The WBC count is decreasing, but low-grade temperatures are still present. The progression suggests a hematoma, and it would be contraindicated to attempt to drain it as this would cause further bleeding and possible seeding. Monitoring the Hct and holding heparin is recommended"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   developing L psoas hematoma.
   # Altered mental status: Improving, now agitated
    Patient
s mental status improving marginally now several days off
   sedation (but also off HD).  He is now opening his eyes to voice, but
   does not yet follow commands.  Given his immunosuppression, he is more
   susceptible to CNS infections, however his slow improvement is staying
   our hand at further intervention at this time.  Largest concerns would
   be CNS infection or status epilepticus (non-convulsive). He was seen by
   psych not recommending starting anti-depressant urgently given
   patient
s current status.
   - Consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  Hct stable
   The patient has a L sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is
   either hematoma or abscess.  Given that his Hct has dropped, he was on
   Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing but still has low grade
   temperatures, he clinically appears to have hematoma rather than
   abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression is so suggestive of
   hematoma that it would be contraindicated to attempt to drain as this
   would cause further bleeding and possible seeding.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis (7 day course), continuing
   Micafungin
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.  Electrolyte
   derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.  Off HD, phos
   has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing several health issues.

The patient's mental status has been improving but he remains agitated and does not follow commands. He is on a tracheostomy mask without sedation due to respiratory failure caused by ARDS, paraflu pneumonia, and possible PE. He also has an ileopsoas hematoma on the left side, which is being closely monitored as it may be either a hematoma or abscess.

The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to contrast exposure initially. His electrolyte derangements are increasing, and he has developed hyponatremia. He is also being treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus and has a history of multiple myeloma.

The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), which is well-controlled with metoprolol and digoxin. However, digoxin levels need to be monitored due to supratherapeutic levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CNS Infection: Given the patient's immunosuppression, he is more susceptible to central nervous system (CNS) infections. His altered mental status and lack of improvement raise concerns about CNS infection or status epilepticus (non"

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   prolonged ICU course for respiratory failure, bacteremia and acute
   renal failure with respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible
   PE), s/p completed course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line
   infxn; currently on trach mask without sedation having persistent
   altered mental status and developing L psoas hematoma.
   # Altered mental status: Improving, now agitated
    Patient
s mental status improving marginally now several days off
   sedation (but also off HD).  He is now opening his eyes to voice, but
   does not yet follow commands.  Given his immunosuppression, he is more
   susceptible to CNS infections, however his slow improvement is staying
   our hand at further intervention at this time.  Largest concerns would
   be CNS infection or status epilepticus (non-convulsive). He was seen by
   psych not recommending starting anti-depressant urgently given
   patient
s current status.
   - Consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  Hct stable
   The patient has a L sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is
   either hematoma or abscess.  Given that his Hct has dropped, he was on
   Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing but still has low grade
   temperatures, he clinically appears to have hematoma rather than
   abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression is so suggestive of
   hematoma that it would be contraindicated to attempt to drain as this
   would cause further bleeding and possible seeding.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis (7 day course), continuing
   Micafungin

   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.  Electrolyte
   derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.  Off HD, phos
   has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has had a prolonged ICU course due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He has been treated for E. coli bacteremia and staphylococcal line infection, and is currently on a tracheostomy without sedation. The patient's mental status has been altered, and he is showing signs of agitation. There is a concern for central nervous system (CNS) infection or non-convulsive status epilepticus. An MRI may be considered if there is no improvement.

The patient has developed a left ileopsoas hematoma, which is either a hematoma or abscess. His hematocrit (Hct) has stabilized, and he is on heparin. It is recommended to follow the Hct levels and hold heparin. If there is continued concern for abscess formation, drainage may be considered, but not at this time.

The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure, possibly related to contrast initially. He is also experiencing electrolyte derangements and hyponatremia. Sevelamer has been increased.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved with the placement of a tracheostomy and tracheostomy mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation. However, mental status remains a barrier to trache"

","The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has had a prolonged ICU course due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He is currently extubated to a tracheostomy and showing improvement in mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving but still altered. Possible causes include uremia, sepsis, sedative medications, and delirium of the critically ill. Monitoring his mental status closely is important, and worsening symptoms may require further evaluation with an MRI or lumbar puncture.

2. Ileopsoas hematoma: The patient developed a left-sided ileopsoas hematoma while on heparin for a possible pulmonary embolism. His hematocrit has been stable after receiving 2 units of blood yesterday. There are no signs of infection or abscess formation at this time. Heparin should be held, and the drainage issue should be readdressed if there is concern for abscess formation.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation problem indicated by a negative Staph wound culture. He is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and possibly contrast initially. His urine output is negligible, and electrolyte derangements are increasing. The patient is due for an HD line today, and off HD, his phosphate levels have risen along with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer has been increased.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is now on a tracheostomy and tracheostomy mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation. He is doing well overnight but has a barrier to tracheostomy removal due to mental status changes. He should continue with MDIs, tracheostomy mask, and consideration of a head MRI or lumbar puncture to assess the cause of mental status change.

5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient has good rate control with metoprolol and digoxin. His digoxin levels should be monitored, and if supratherapeutic, it should be held. No systemic anticoagulation is required.

6. Multiple myeloma: The patient underwent SCT for multiple myeloma. Daily liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin should be monitored. Cellcept dosing should be followed, and cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance should be obtained daily.

7. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose is difficult to control in the setting of infection. Humalog sliding scale with Lantus should continue, followed by frequent serum glucose (FSG) monitoring and adjustment based on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) status."

   He will now follow commands and open eyes to voice. Working theories of
   his alteration include uremia, sepsis, sedative medications, delirium
   of the critically ill.
   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has been stable
   s/p 2 units of blood yesterday.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to
   suggest an abscess or infected hematoma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Coag (-) Staph wound culture:  Patient
s midline tip culture positive
   for Coag (-) staph.  Already started on Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis
   (which is resolving).
   - Vancomycin HD protocol for 7 days total course
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   - HD line in place, patient with every other day HD.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin (level
   1.5)
   - Restart Dig 0.125mg every other day.
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He has had a prolonged ICU course due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. Currently, the patient is extubated to a tracheostomy and doing well. His mental status continues to improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of AF with rapid ventricular response. He is being managed with metoprolol and digoxin. The plan is to restart digoxin at a low dose.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy. He is currently on hemodialysis (HD) every other day.
3. Ileopsoas Hematoma: The patient developed a left-sided ileopsoas hematoma while on heparin. His hematocrit has stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood yesterday. There are no signs of infection or abscess formation at this time.
4. Coag-Negative Staph Wound Infection: The patient's midline tip culture is positive for coag-negative staph. He has already started on vancomycin and levofloxacin. The plan is to continue vancomycin for a total of 7 days.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Monitoring"

   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   - no indication for home psych meds at this time per psych, but they
   will re-eval him as mental stus improves
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided spontaneous ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has
   been stable for two days.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to suggest
   an abscess or infected hematoma.  There was a question of aspirating
   hematoma to ensure that it was not infected, but we believe that this
   is contra-indicated currently; if he develops increasing signs of
   infection or recurrent bacterimia, would re-address this as a source.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin, hold SQH per BMT
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Coag (-) Staph wound culture:  Patient
s midline tip culture positive
   for Coag (-) staph.  Started on Vanc/Levo ON [**4-7**] for leukocytosis
   (which is resolving). Now off levo. Midline removed on [**4-8**].  Of note,
   pt had coag negative staff growing from port-a-cath which was removed 2
   weeks ago
he has not grown this on blood culture in the interim.
   - Vancomycin HD protocol for 7 days total course strting on date of
   line removal: 7 days from [**4-8**]
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast, acyclovir, initially; may have started with some
   damage from myeloma.  Urine output neglibile.
   - HD line in place, patient with every other day HD.  Getting UF
   between HD sessions.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask; not
   requiring pressure support
vent rest
 for several days.  Improving
   steadily. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask with 35% FIO2
   - despite prior concern for PE, no plan for heparin or CTA per BMT
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin (level
   1.3
 1.8)
   - Restarted Dig 0.125mg every other day on [**4-10**]
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance; current trough levels
   high
   - valganciclovir for CMV ppx
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has had a prolonged ICU course due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He is currently extubated to a tracheostomy and is doing well with improving mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been diagnosed with AF and is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin. The goal is to maintain rate control.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is on hemodialysis (HD). His urine output is negligible, and he is receiving UF between HD sessions.
3. Ileopsoas Hematoma: The patient developed a left-sided spontaneous ileopsoas hematoma while on heparin for a possible PE. His hematocrit has been stable for two days, and there is no fever or leukocytosis suggesting an abscess or infected hematoma. Aspiration of the hematoma is not currently indicated, but if the patient develops signs of infection or recurrent bacteremia, it may be reconsidered.
4. Coag-Negative Staph Wound Infection: The patient's midline tip culture was positive for coag-negative staph. He has been started on Vanc/Levo, and his port-a-cath was removed two weeks ago. He has"
