   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p DES to the RCA.
   .
   # Right Ventricular Infarct:  The patient presented with chest pain and
   subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to
   have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation,
   subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the
   mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on
   cooling protocol.  He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac
   catheterization.
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
    - Repeat TTE today
    - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Start Dobutamine if needed to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG in the am
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned at
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE today
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation
   - Continue to monitor
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   #  Identity:  The patient presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with minimal
   paperwork, after driving there himself.  Records from [**Hospital1 12**] gave his
   mother, [**Name (NI) 7816**] [**Name (NI) 7817**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7818**]) as his next of [**Doctor First Name 23**].  He is single
   and not married.  The patient has a cell phone, but no saved numbers.
    - Consider Ethics C/S in the am re: calling numbers from phone in
   order to alert family
    - Re-attempt calling patient's mother in am.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and diagonal branch, as well as a stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA).
2. The patient presented with symptoms of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was transferred from another hospital.
3. He experienced loss of consciousness and was found to have ST elevation in leads II, III, and AVF. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.
4. The patient was started on a cooling protocol and received dopamine briefly before cardiac catheterization.
5. He is currently sedated with fentanyl and versed, and paralyzed with vecuronium for 18 hours.
6. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 40 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/59 to 67/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned 7.47/24/206; Improving, but now with low pCO@
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE today
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Dopamine gtt for now to increase contracility and CO
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 4.1 today; improving
      - 2 amps of bicarb given
      - Consult with RT to balance RR with acidosis
      - continue to monitor with q 12 lactates
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation AST 415 ALT 288

","The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). He experienced a right ventricular infarct and had a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA. The patient was resuscitated, started on a cooling protocol, and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He also has a nose bleed and elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating possible myocardial damage. The patient's identity is uncertain, and efforts are being made to contact his family. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Right ventricular infarct: The patient's presentation with chest pain and subsequent loss of consciousness indicates a serious complication related to the heart attack. The right ventricular infarct could lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and hemodynamic instability.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated due to fighting the ventilator and had an initial ABG showing respiratory acidosis. Although he is now more stable on the ventilator, monitoring for any worsening respiratory distress and ensuring proper oxygenation and ventilation is crucial.

3. Nose bleed: The patient experienced a persistent nose bleed, which could be attributed to traumatic NG tube placement and anticoagulant therapy. Continuous monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a STEMI and underwent stenting of the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery. He is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient is sedated and paralyzed, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. He has been undergoing a cooling protocol due to a cardiac arrest, but his temperature is now being rewarmed. He is receiving dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure and dobutamine for cardiac support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/59 mmHg to 67/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 521 mL since admission. Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, lactate, and liver enzymes. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine level. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low (43 bpm), indicating bradycardia. Close monitoring and atropine administration may be required to manage this condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is below normal, indicating hypotension."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p DES to the RCA.
   .
   # Right Ventricular Infarct:  The patient presented with chest pain and
   subsequently lost consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to
   have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation,
   subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the
   mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on
   cooling protocol.  He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac
   catheterization.
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
    - TTE today
    - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Start Dobutamine if needed to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG in the am
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned at
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE today
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 4.1 today
      - 2 amps of bicarb given
      - Consult with RT to balance RR with acidosis
      - continue to monitor with q 12 lactates
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation AST 415 ALT 288
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   .
   # Diabetes: Unsure of home medications as cannot obtain records or an
   emergency contact
         -Elevated BS on Chemistries
        - Start sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   #  Identity:  The patient presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with minimal
   paperwork, after driving there himself.  Records from [**Hospital1 12**] gave his
   mother, [**Name (NI) 7816**] [**Name (NI) 7817**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7818**]) as his next of [**Doctor First Name 23**].  He is single
   and not married.  The patient has a cell phone, but no saved numbers.
    - Consider Ethics C/S in the am re: calling numbers from phone in
   order to alert family
    - Re-attempt calling patient's mother in am.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # STEMI:  The patient presented with chest pain and subsequently lost
   consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to have STe in II, III,
   AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac
   catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin
   and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on cooling protocol.
   He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac catheterization. Rewarming
   starts at 1130
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
   - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Continue Dopamine to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
   -  Atropine if patient becomes increasingly bradycardic.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG  tomorrow AM.
    - Replete lytes
   - TTE tomorrow
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.

   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned 7.47/24/206; Improving, but now with low pCO@
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE tomorrow.
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). He is now experiencing multiple complications including acute systolic congestive heart failure, respiratory distress, lactic acidosis, nose bleed, and potential diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's elevated biventricular filling pressures indicate acute right ventricular (RV) infarction. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure and fluid overload is crucial. TTE tomorrow can help assess cardiac function and fluid status.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient was intubated due to cardiac arrest and initial ABG showed respiratory acidosis. Current ABG is improving, but low pCO2 may indicate respiratory alkalosis. Continue CMV ventilation, aim for low 100s pO2, and CO2 between 35-40. Maintain VAP precautions with HOB elevation.

3. Lactic Acidosis: Lactate levels have improved from 10 to 4.1 today. Bicarb was given, and further monitoring with q12 lactates is recommended. Consult with RT to balance RR with acidosis.

4. Nose Bleed: The patient had a persistent nose bleed, likely due to"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES
   to the LAD and D1, and hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital1 **] with STEMI and is now s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # STEMI:  The patient presented with chest pain and subsequently lost
   consciousness at [**Hospital3 519**].  He was found to have STe in II, III,
   AVF, and after one hour of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac
   catheterization demonstrated a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin
   and integrilin gtts were held, and he was started on cooling protocol.
   He was on Dopamine briefly prior to cardiac catheterization. Rewarming
   starts at 1130
    - Continue cooling protocol with Fentanyl/Verset for sedation and
   Vecuronium for paralytics for 18 hours
    - Continue to monitor CK, troponins x3
   - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Give IVFs as needed to maintain MAPs > 60
    - Continue Dopamine to maintain MAP > 60.
    - Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and electrolyte shifts with
   cooling protocol
   -  Atropine if patient becomes increasingly bradycardic.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG  tomorrow AM.

   #. Respiratory Distress:  The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 519**]
   in the setting of cardiac arrest.  He was fighting the ventilator on
   arrival and his initial ABG was 7.23/40/273.  After cardiac
   catheterization, he became more stable on the ventilator and his
   current ABG returned 7.47/24/206; Improving, but now with low pCO@
    - Continue on CMV during cooling protocol
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  The patient had an acute RV
   infarct this afternoon, and his hemodynamics in the cath lab
   demonstrated increased biventricular filling pressures.  He does not
   have a known history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated
   filling pressures are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE tomorrow.
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Dopamine gtt for now to increase contracility and CO
   .
   # Nose bleed:  The patient had a persistent nose bleed this afternoon
   in the setting of traumatic NGT placement and integrilin/heparin gtts.
   The bleeding appears to have stopped with Afrin nasal spray, and the
   patient's Hct has remained stable.
    - Recheck Hct q6h
    - Continue Afrin NS
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 4.1 today; improving
      - 2 amps of bicarb given
      - Consult with RT to balance RR with acidosis
      - continue to monitor with q 12 lactates
   #Shock Liver: Elevated Enzymes s/p resuscitation AST 415 ALT 288 and
   trended down this AM.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Unsure of home medications as cannot obtain records or an
   emergency contact
         -Elevated BS on Chemistries
        - Start sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS

   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI and is
   now s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He was started on cooling protocol.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down overnight.
    - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   - Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
   -  Continue Dopamine to maintain MAP > 60, wean as tolerated.
   -  Atropine if patient becomes increasingly bradycardic.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increase Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose BB as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG  tomorrow AM.
   - TTE tomorrow
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.

   #. Respiratory Distress:  ABG 7.4/45/96 on AC (400, 15, 5, 35%)
    - Continue on CMV until neuro status better evaluated
   -  PS trial today, Wean CMV as tolerated.
    - Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2 between
   35 and 40.
    - Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   #Neuro Status: Patient with EEG overnight. Neuro will reevaluate
   further today. Patient responds to name and can move bilateral upper
   extremity.
   -          FU Neuro recommendations
   -          FU EEG recommendations
   -          Wean sedation as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   #Fever: After rewarming patient with low grade temperatures this
   morning on continual monitoring (100.7). Given prolonged resuscitation,
   intubation aspiration pneumonia is high on the differential. Will also
   consider sepsis, UTI.
   -          Blood Cultures x 2
   -          UA, Urine Cultures
   -          FU Chest Xray from today
   -          If spikes white count, continues to be febrile, consider
   covering empirically with Vanc/Zosyn.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE tomorrow.
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Dopamine gtt for now to increase contracility and CO
   .
   # Nose bleed:  Stable. Without rebleed in the last 24 hours. HCT stable
    - Continue Afrin NS as needed.
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). The patient now shows signs of rewarming after therapeutic hypothermia and continues to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement. The patient's neurological status is improving, as evidenced by opening eyes to name and comprehension. However, there is some difficulty following directions. The patient has a history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient may develop acute RV infarct leading to elevated filling pressures and congestive heart failure.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient may experience pulmonary edema due to acute MR, which could require intervention.
3. Fever: The patient has a low-grade temperature, which may indicate an infection such as intubation aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infection.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   To my surprise, the echocardiogram from this morning shows exdcellent
   LV function (LVEF > 60), albeit perhaps with a little focal inferior
   wall HK.  The RV, which we expected to be somewhat dysfunctional, is
   only mildly (if at all) hypocontractile.  His lowish BP even on
   dopamine may therefore reflect relative hypovolemia, so therefore we
   will give him some volume back and try to wean off diopamine.  His
   respiratory function appears OK for weaning and extubation today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI. He underwent resuscitation, ventricular fibrillation arrest, and received a bare metal stent (BMS) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fever: The patient has a low-grade temperature of 100.7°F (38.2°C) after rewarming. There is a concern for intubation aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infection (UTI).

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.40, pCO2 of 45 mmHg, and pO2 of 96%. There is an ongoing effort to wean off the ventilator and extubate the patient today. The goal is to maintain a Po2 in the low 100s and CO2 between 35-40%.

3. Neuro Status: The patient responds to name and can move bilateral upper extremities. An EEG was performed overnight, and further neuro evaluation is planned.

4. Rhythm: The patient presented in ventricular fibrillation (VFib) arrest and had a junctional rhythm. He is now in sinus rhythm, but monitoring on telemetry is continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia who presented with a STEMI and underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and diagonal branch, as well as a bare metal stent (BMS) placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). He was found to have ST-elevation in leads II, III, and AVF, and a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA. The patient was started on a cooling protocol, and his cardiac enzymes are trending down overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient initially presented with a STEMI and had a fresh thrombus in the RCA. There is a risk of recurrent AMI or progression of the existing infarction.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to the acute RV infarct. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure and managing preload dependency is important.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient presented in ventricular fibrillation (VFib) and later developed a junctional rhythm. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be done to detect any arrhythmias, especially bradycardia and hypotension.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has an ABG indicating respiratory distress. Weaning off CMV and considering a"

   -  Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose, started on SC heparin for DVT proph
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
   -  Wean Dopamine as long as MAP >60, as patient now currently
   revascularized, but may need to continue due to low BP
   -  Atropine if patient becomes increasingly bradycardic
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Increased Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Start low dose Beta Blocker as BP tolerates
    - Repeat ECG this am.

    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   #Fever: After rewarming patient with low grade temperatures this
   morning on continual monitoring (100.7). Given prolonged resuscitation,
   intubation aspiration pneumonia is high on the differential. Will also
   consider sepsis, UTI.
   -          Blood Cultures x 2
   -          UA, Urine Cultures
   -          FU Chest Xray from today
   -          If spikes white count, continues to be febrile, consider
   covering empirically with Vanc/Zosyn.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
    - TTE today, will FU results
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Dopamine gtt currently, will attempt to wean today

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was successfully defibrillated from ventricular fibrillation (VFib). The patient also received a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the right coronary artery (RCA) due to a fresh thrombus. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with sedation.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. His temperature is 100.7°F, indicating a low-grade fever. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting improvement in myocardial injury.

The patient's neurological status is improving as he opens his eyes to name and comprehension, although there is some difficulty with following directions. His pupils are minimally reactive and sluggish.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), lactate levels, troponin T, and cardiac enzymes. Blood cultures have been obtained, and antibiotic coverage will be initiated if there is a fever or an increase in WBC count. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, but liver enzymes are elevated.

The patient's chest X-ray from yesterday showed no acute pulmonary edema. A"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a STEMI and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and diagonal branch, as well as to the right coronary artery (RCA). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in cardiac enzymes and is expected to be weaned off dopamine soon. However, he still requires sedation and has difficulty following commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's ABG results indicate hypoxemia (pO2 of 45), which may suggest respiratory distress. This could be due to acute respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Further evaluation and appropriate measures, such as weaning off CMV ventilation, should be taken.
2. Neurological Status: The patient's neurological status is still being evaluated, and he is scheduled for an EEG. There is a concern for potential neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke or encephalopathy. Monitoring and further assessment are necessary.
3. Fever: The patient developed a low-grade fever after rewarming, which may indicate an infection such as intubation aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood cultures, urine cultures, and a chest X-ray should be obtained to identify the source of infection.
4. Acute Systolic Congestive"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p vfib arrest and was coded for approximately 54 minutes.  He is
   now also s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # ?Pneumonia/Fever: With increasing secretions, fever, prelim sputum
   culture showing some growth, and increasing infiltrate on CXR; concern
   for pneumonia; 1.  Aspiration: Prolonged resuscitation in OSH; 2.  VAP
   as patient has been ventilated for 3 days.  Lower on differential, but
   cannot rule out 3. UTI as UA is not pristine. 4. Also line sepsis is on
   the list
as patient has had femoral lines placed during cath.
   Encouraging is that patient does have normal white count without bands.
   -          Start empiric therapy for PNA today -> Zosyn/Vanc (day 1
   [**8-30**])
   -          Will send another sputum gram stain and culture
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs
   -          UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx pending; will follow up
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He was started on cooling protocol.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and fluid boluses prn for pressure control.
   - Attempt to wean Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   -  Dopamine stopped, and monitor for MAPs <60.  If low BP, will bolus
   with IVF.
   -  Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose, started on SC heparin for DVT proph
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor to 80 mg daily
   - Attempt to start low dose Beta Blocker as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  ABG on PS 7.38/48/80 with FIO2 of 35;
   patient
s respiratory status improving. Continuing vent support
   secondary to unable to manage secretions yesterday. Moderate amount of
   tan/thick secretions.
     -  Continue with daily RSBI tests & SBT's as tolerated to wean off of
   PS.  Will attempt extubation today.
    -  Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2
   between 35 and 40.
    -  Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   #Neuro Status: Patient with EEG overnight. Patient responds to name and
   actively moving all extremities. Neuro feels this is promising.
   -          FU Neuro recommendations
   -          FU EEG recommendations
   -          Wean sedation as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Nose bleed:  With bloody secretions from the back of his throat this
   morning.. HCT trending down 31->27
   - q 12 Hct,
   - transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets down from 218 ([**8-28**]) to 149 today.
   Possibly early-onset HIT which is of little consequence. But cannot
   rule out other causes.
   - Check CBC this PM
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 1.6 [**8-28**]. Resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p vfib arrest and was coded for approximately 54 minutes.  He is
   now also s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # ?Pneumonia/Fever: With increasing secretions, fever, prelim sputum
   culture showing some growth, and increasing infiltrate on CXR; concern
   for pneumonia; 1.  Aspiration: Prolonged resuscitation in OSH; 2.  VAP
   as patient has been ventilated for 3 days.  Lower on differential, but
   cannot rule out 3. UTI as UA is not pristine. 4. Also line sepsis is on
   the list
as patient has had femoral lines placed during cath.
   Encouraging is that patient does have normal white count without bands.
   -          Consider starting empiric Tx for PNA today -> Zosyn/Vanc
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs
   -          UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx pending; will follow up
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He was started on cooling protocol.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and fluid boluses prn for pressure control.
    - Attempt to wean Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   -  Dopamine stopped, and monitor for MAPs <60
   -  Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose, started on SC heparin for DVT proph
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Continue Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Attempt to start low dose Beta Blocker as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  ABG on PS 7.38/48/80 with FIO2 of 35;
   patient
s respiratory status improving. Continuing vent support
   secondary to unable to manage secretions yesterday. Moderate amount of
   tan/thick secretions.
     -  Continue with daily RSBI tests & SBT's as tolerated to wean off of
   PS
    -  Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2
   between 35 and 40.
    -  Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   #Neuro Status: Patient with EEG overnight. Patient responds to name and
   actively moving all extremities. Neuro feels this is promising.
   -          FU Neuro recommendations
   -          FU EEG recommendations
   -          Wean sedation as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diuresis as
   needed
   .
   # Nose bleed:  Stable. Without rebleed in the last 48 hours. HCT
   trending down 31->27
    - q 12 Hct,
   - transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed.
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets down from 218 ([**8-28**]) to 149 today.
   Possibly early onset HIT which is of little consequence. But cannot
   rule out other causes.
   - Check CBC this PM
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Will discuss with pcp/cardiologist today
   - Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 1.6 [**8-28**]. Resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was also resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation (VFib). The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and elevated lactate levels. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's white blood cell count is normal without bandemia. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further investigations such as sputum culture and urine analysis are pending. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in his myocardial infarction. His hemodynamic status is stable, and he is off pressors. The patient's neurological status is improving, and he is responsive to commands. There is no evidence of acute congestive heart failure, and his left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is preserved. The patient's platelet count is slightly low, and he has a history of hyperlipidemia. His blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and various interventions are being implemented to manage his multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p vfib arrest and was coded for approximately 54 minutes.  He is
   now also s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He was started on cooling protocol.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and fluid boluses prn for pressure control.
    - Attempt to wean Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   -  Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose, started on SC heparin for DVT proph
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
   -  Dopamine stopped, and monitor for MAPs <60
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Continue Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Attempt to start low dose Beta Blocker as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards

   #. Respiratory Distress:  ABG on PS 7.38/48/80 with FIO2 of 35;
   patient
s respiratory status improving. Continuing vent support
   secondary to unable to manage secretions yesterday. Moderate amount of
   tan/thick secretions.
     -  Continue with daily RSBI tests & SBT's as tolerated to wean off of
   PS
    -  Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2
   between 35 and 40.
    -  Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # ?Pneumonia/Fever: With increasing secretions, fever, prelim sputum
   culture showing some growth, and increasing infiltrate on CXR; concern
   for pneumonia; 1.  Aspiration: Prolonged resuscitation in OSH; 2.  VAP
   as patient has been ventilated for 3 days.  Lower on differential, but
   cannot rule out 3. UTI as UA is not pristine. 4. Also line sepsis is on
   the list
as patient has had femoral lines placed during cath.
   Encouraging is that patient does have normal white count without bands.
   -          Consider starting empiric Tx for PNA today -> Zosyn/Vanc
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA. The patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest and was resuscitated. He also received a stent to the RCA. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still on ventilatory support due to difficulty managing secretions. There are concerns about pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and line sepsis. The patient's neurologic status is encouraging, with an EEG showing promising results. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. He does not have a history of congestive heart failure, and his acute systolic congestive heart failure is likely due to an acute right ventricular infarct. The patient has stable nosebleeds, and his lactic acidosis and liver function tests are resolving."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI. He underwent resuscitation and cardiac catheterization, which revealed a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA. The patient was started on a cooling protocol and is now off pressors and fluid boluses as his blood pressure is being maintained.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires ventilator support due to secretions. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely aspiration pneumonia, and is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient's neurological status is also improving, and he is expected to do well after extubation.

Other medical complications that could arise include line sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's platelet count has decreased, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improving cardiac function. However, he has evidence of acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to an acute right ventricular infarct. Close monitoring for signs of fluid overload and diuresis as needed is recommended.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving, and he is expected to be extubated soon. However, careful monitoring for potential medical complications is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p vfib arrest and was coded for approximately 54 minutes.  He is
   now also s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He was started on cooling protocol.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and fluid boluses prn for pressure control.
    - Attempt to wean Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   -  Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose, started on SC heparin for DVT proph
    - Hold on Lasix for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
   -  Dopamine stopped, and monitor for MAPs <60
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Continue Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Attempt to start low dose Beta Blocker as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  ABG on PS 7.38/48/80 with FIO2 of 35;
   patient
s respiratory status improving. Continuing vent support
   secondary to unable to manage secretions yesterday. Moderate amount of
   tan/thick secretions.
     -  Continue with daily RSBI tests & SBT's as tolerated to wean off of
   PS
    -  Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2
   between 35 and 40.
    -  Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   # ?Pneumonia/Fever: With increasing secretions, fever, prelim sputum
   culture showing some growth, and increasing infiltrate on CXR; concern
   for pneumonia; 1.  Aspiration: Prolonged resuscitation in OSH; 2.  VAP
   as patient has been ventilated for 3 days.  Lower on differential, but
   cannot rule out 3. UTI as UA is not pristine. 4. Also line sepsis is on
   the list
as patient has had femoral lines placed during cath.
   Encouraging is that patient does have normal white count without bands.
   -          Consider starting empiric Tx for PNA today -> Zosyn/Vanc
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs
   -          UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx pending; will follow up
   #Neuro Status: Patient with EEG overnight. Patient responds to name and
   actively moving all extremities. Neuro feels this is promising.
   -          FU Neuro recommendations
   -          FU EEG recommendations
   -          Wean sedation as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diuresis as
   needed
   .
   # Nose bleed:  Stable. Without rebleed in the last 48 hours. HCT stable
    - Continue Afrin NS as needed.
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Will discuss with pcp/cardiologist today
   - Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 1.6 [**8-28**]. Resolved.

   Disposition: ICU (needs ICU consent form)
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have a fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA. Heparin and integrilin infusions were held due to a nosebleed.

2. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement. He is now off pressors and fluid boluses are given as needed for pressure control.

3. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires ventilator support due to secretions. Moderate amounts of tan/thick secretions have been observed. Daily respiratory system assessment and weaning off positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) will be continued.

4. The patient's neurologic status is encouraging, with the ability to respond to name and actively move all extremities. An EEG was performed overnight, and the neurologist feels this is promising.

5. The patient presented in ventricular fibrillation (VFib) arrest and then had a junctional rhythm. He is currently in sinus rhythm. Telemetry monitoring will continue, along with repletion of potassium and magnesium.

6. The patient does not have a known history of congestive heart failure (CHF), and the elevated filling pressures seen in the cath lab are most likely due to acute right ventricular (RV) infar"

   Chief Complaint: STEMI
   24 Hour Events:
   Weaned dopamine throughout the day, now completely off, given 1.5L
   bolus to maintain pressure.  MAP's in the 60's throughout the
   afternoon.  Dropped to 50's at about 11pm - given 1L bolus plus put on
   maintenance fluids.
   Continues to be febrile with lots of brownish secretions, given tylenol
   per rectum.  Will repeat CXR tonight and in am.
   - Outpt cardiologist felt that patient likely aspirated (he witnessed
   the code).
   RT felt that should not attempt extubation [**3-14**] increased secretions -
   will plan to extubate today
   - Neuro will continue to watch, feel that EEG and clinical exam
   promising.  No need for imaging at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and diagonal branch, and also had stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress, which is improving. The patient has a fever and shows signs of infection, with preliminary sputum culture showing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. There are concerns for pneumonia, possibly aspiration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as well as urinary tract infection (UTI) and line sepsis. Neurologically, the patient is showing promising signs of improvement with movement of bilateral upper extremities and a normal EEG. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in myocardial injury. He is currently off pressors and fluid boluses, but his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is still in the 60s. The patient's kidney function is stable, and he has no known history of congestive heart failure (CHF). However, he has evidence of acute systolic CHF due to a suspected right ventricular (RV) infarct. The patient's lactic acidosis has resolved, and his liver function tests"

   bolus to maintain pressure.  MAP's in the 60's throughout the
   afternoon.  Dropped to 50's at about 11pm - given 1L bolus plus put on
   maintenance fluids.
   Temp to 101.1 yesterday with lots of brownish secretions, given tylenol
   per rectum.
   - Outpt cardiologist felt that patient likely aspirated (he witnessed
   the code).
   - Pulled right fem line yesterday
   -RT felt that should not attempt extubation [**3-14**] increased secretions
   yesterday - will attempt to extubate today

   24 Hour Events:
   Weaned dopamine throughout the day, now completely off, given 1.5L
   bolus to maintain pressure.  MAP's in the 60's throughout the
   afternoon.  Dropped to 50's at about 11pm - given 1L bolus plus put on
   maintenance fluids.
   Temp to 101.1 yesterday with lots of brownish secretions, given tylenol
   per rectum.
   - Outpt cardiologist felt that patient likely aspirated (he witnessed
   the code).
   - Pulled right fem line yesterday
   -RT felt that should not attempt extubation [**3-14**] increased secretions

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p vfib arrest and was coded for approximately 54 minutes.  He is
   now also s/p BMS to the RCA.
   .
   # ?Pneumonia/Fever: With increasing secretions, fever, prelim sputum
   culture showing some growth, and increasing infiltrate on CXR; concern
   for pneumonia; 1.  Aspiration: Prolonged resuscitation in OSH; 2.  VAP
   as patient has been ventilated for 3 days.  Lower on differential, but
   cannot rule out 3. UTI as UA is not pristine. 4. Also line sepsis is on
   the list
as patient has had femoral lines placed during cath.
   Encouraging is that patient does have normal white count without bands.
   -          Consider starting empiric Tx for PNA today -> Zosyn/Vanc
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs
   -          UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx pending; will follow up
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He was started on cooling protocol.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and fluid boluses prn for pressure control.
    - Attempt to wean Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   -  Dopamine stopped, and monitor for MAPs <60
   -  Continue to hold heparin and integrilin, given significant bleeding
   from nose, started on SC heparin for DVT proph
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
    - Continue Lipitor to 80 mg daily
    - Attempt to start low dose Beta Blocker as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, consider acute MR, contact cards
   fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  ABG on PS 7.38/48/80 with FIO2 of 35;
   patient
s respiratory status improving. Continuing vent support
   secondary to unable to manage secretions yesterday. Moderate amount of
   tan/thick secretions.
     -  Continue with daily RSBI tests & SBT's as tolerated to wean off of
   PS
    -  Aim for pO2 in the low 100s (decrease free radicals) and CO2
   between 35 and 40.
    -  Continue VAP precautions with raising the HOB to 30%
   #Neuro Status: Patient with EEG overnight. Patient responds to name and
   actively moving all extremities. Neuro feels this is promising.
   -          FU Neuro recommendations
   -          FU EEG recommendations
   -          Wean sedation as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent.
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diuresis as
   needed
   .
   # Nose bleed:  Stable. Without rebleed in the last 48 hours. HCT
   trending down 31->27
    - q 12 Hct,
   - transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed.
    - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets down from 218 ([**8-28**]) to 149 today.
   Possibly early onset HIT
   - Check CBC this PM
   - If continues to decrease consider changing heparin to lovenox
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Will discuss with pcp/cardiologist today
   - Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   .
   #Lactic Acidosis: Lactate 10 in cath to 1.6 [**8-28**]. Resolved.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU (needs ICU consent form)
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI. He underwent resuscitation and cardiac catheterization, which showed a fresh thrombus in the mid-right coronary artery. The patient received heparin and integrilin but had to stop due to a nosebleed. He is currently off pressors and fluid boluses as needed for pressure control. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improving cardiac function.

The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided:

1. Pneumonia/Fever: The patient has a fever, increasing secretions, and a preliminary sputum culture showing some growth. There is concern for pneumonia, and it is recommended to start empirical treatment for pneumonia today with Zosyn/Vanc. Daily chest X-rays will be followed to monitor the patient's respiratory status.

2. Aspiration: The prolonged resuscitation in the emergency department raises the possibility of aspiration. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also a concern since the patient has been ventilated for three days.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The urine analysis shows moderate blood, trace protein, and 26 red blood cells. Although not pristine, it cannot be ruled out as a possible infection.

4. Line sepsis: The patient has had femoral lines placed during catheterization, which increases the risk of line sepsis.

   Urine culture [**2118-8-29**]: Group B Strep >100,000 organisms/ml
Sputum culture [**2118-8-29**]: Gram stain showed 4+ Gram Positive Cocci in pairs and cl
usters, 2+ gram positive rods.  Culture with heavy growth of Staph aureus (coag
+) and oropharyngeal flora.
   Sputum culture [**2118-8-30**]: Gram stain showed 4+ Gram Positive Cocci in
   pairs and clusters, 4+ gram positive rods, 1+ GNR, 1+ GN diplococci,
   culture pending
   Blood cultures from [**8-29**] and [**8-31**] pending
   Wound culture from catheter tip ([**8-29**]): No significant growh
   CXR [**2118-8-30**]: The ET tube tip is about 2 cm above the carina. The NG
   tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the
   stomach, although its tip is below the inferior margin of the field.
   There is unchanged left basal opacity consistent most likely with
   atelectasis with a smaller area of right basilar opacity. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present. There is no overt
   evidence of pneumothorax. Overall, there is no pulmonary edema and no
   areas of lung consolidation in addition to areas of atelectasis to
   suggest infectious process.
   EEG [**2118-8-30**]: This is an abnormal video-EEG study due to the slow
   background burst suppressive bursts. However, the background rhythm
   appeared to be more organized and the patient appeared to progress to
   drowsiness which is new compared to yesterday's recording. These
   findings continue to suggest an encephalopathy invovling both cortical
   and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
   infection are among the most common causes. There were no clearly
   epileptiform features.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started yesterday secondary to concern for a
   developing pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, and
   his fevers have trended down since beginning antibiotics.  His sputum
   gram stain continues to show gram positive cocci and rods, and his
   urine culture has grown Group B Strep.  His white count is not elevated
   today at 7.8.
   -          Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**3-19**])
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs
   -          F/u with final reads of UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx
   pending
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Will attempt to start low dose beta blocker today as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and contact
   cards fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula.
    -  Wean O2 as tolerated
    -  Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.
    - Continue to follow neurologic status
    - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  With bloody secretions from the back of his throat yesterday
   morning. HCT trending down 31->25, but stable this morning.
   - Will continue to check Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets improved to 160 today (from [**Age over 90 105**]
   yesterday).
   - Continue to monitor
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a STEMI. He underwent a cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent to the left anterior descending artery. The patient then experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He was extubated and is currently improving with stable vital signs and oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with probable pneumonia, for which he has been started on antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime). His fevers have trended down since the initiation of antibiotics. His urine culture grew Group B Strep, and his sputum culture showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus (coag-positive). Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in his myocardial injury. He has been weaned off pressors and is now off the ventilator. The patient's white blood cell count is normal, suggesting no signs of infection.

The patient's neurologic status has improved, and he is now oriented to person, place, and time. He is answering questions and following commands. The EEG showed an abnormal video-EEG study with slow background burst suppressive bursts, but the patient appeared to progress to drowsiness, which is new compared to the previous day's recording. These findings suggest an encephalopathy involving both cortical and subcortical structures.

   Urine culture [**2118-8-29**]: Group B Strep >100,000 organisms/ml
Sputum culture [**2118-8-29**]: Gram stain showed 4+ Gram Positive Cocci in pairs and cl
usters, 2+ gram positive rods.  Culture with heavy growth of Staph aureus (coag
+) and oropharyngeal flora.
   Sputum culture [**2118-8-30**]: Gram stain showed 4+ Gram Positive Cocci in
   pairs and clusters, 4+ gram positive rods, 1+ GNR, 1+ GN diplococci,
   culture pending
   Blood cultures from [**8-29**] and [**8-31**] pending
   Wound culture from catheter tip ([**8-29**]): No significant growh
   CXR [**2118-8-30**]: The ET tube tip is about 2 cm above the carina. The NG
   tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the
   stomach, although its tip is below the inferior margin of the field.
   There is unchanged left basal opacity consistent most likely with
   atelectasis with a smaller area of right basilar opacity. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present. There is no overt
   evidence of pneumothorax. Overall, there is no pulmonary edema and no
   areas of lung consolidation in addition to areas of atelectasis to
   suggest infectious process.
   EEG [**2118-8-30**]: This is an abnormal video-EEG study due to the slow
   background burst suppressive bursts. However, the background rhythm
   appeared to be more organized and the patient appeared to progress to
   drowsiness which is new compared to yesterday's recording. These
   findings continue to suggest an encephalopathy invovling both cortical
   and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
   infection are among the most common causes. There were no clearly
   epileptiform features.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started yesterday secondary to concern for a
   developing pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, and
   his fevers have trended down since beginning antibiotics.  His sputum
   gram stain continues to show gram positive cocci and rods, and his
   urine culture has grown Group B Strep.  His white count is not elevated
   today at 7.8.
   -          Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**3-19**])
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities,
   UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx pending
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Start Metroprolol 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Start 20mg Lasix this AM
   - FU I/O
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and contact
   cards fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula.
    -  Wean O2 as tolerated
   -   Start Lasix 20mg Daily PO
   -   Start Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs.
    -  Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.
    - Continue to follow neurologic status
    - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm, although had some
   sinus pauses overnight.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Start 12.5 mg Metroprolol SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  With bloody secretions from the back of his throat yesterday
   morning. HCT trending down 31->25, but stable this morning.
   - Will continue to check Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets improved to 160 today (from [**Age over 90 105**]
   yesterday).
   - Continue to monitor
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars 127-180.
   - Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a STEMI and was subsequently resuscitated from VFib arrest. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and received a bare metal stent to the RCA. The patient's current condition is stable, with improving vital signs and oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula. 

The patient has been extubated and is showing signs of improvement, although he still has some residual neurologic deficits. His white blood cell count is within normal range, indicating no evidence of infection. However, his urine culture has grown Group B Strep, and his sputum culture shows growth of Staph aureus (coag+), suggesting possible pneumonia. 

The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, which may indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate red blood cell production. His platelet count has improved from yesterday's level. Liver function tests are also improving, indicating resolution of liver dysfunction. 

The patient's blood glucose levels are within a reasonable range, and he is receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to the presence of Group B Strep and Staph aureus in his respiratory cultures. Additionally, the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia should be closely monitored and managed accordingly. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving, with stable vital signs"

   CXR [**2118-8-30**]: The ET tube tip is about 2 cm above the carina. The NG
   tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the
   stomach, although its tip is below the inferior margin of the field.
   There is unchanged left basal opacity consistent most likely with
   atelectasis with a smaller area of right basilar opacity. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present. There is no overt
   evidence of pneumothorax. Overall, there is no pulmonary edema and no
   areas of lung consolidation in addition to areas of atelectasis to
   suggest infectious process.
   EEG [**2118-8-30**]: This is an abnormal video-EEG study due to the slow
   background burst suppressive bursts. However, the background rhythm
   appeared to be more organized and the patient appeared to progress to
   drowsiness which is new compared to yesterday's recording. These
   findings continue to suggest an encephalopathy invovling both cortical
   and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and
   infection are among the most common causes. There were no clearly
   epileptiform features.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started yesterday secondary to concern for a
   developing pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, and
   his fevers have trended down since beginning antibiotics.  His sputum
   gram stain continues to show gram positive cocci and rods, and his
   urine culture has grown Group B Strep.  His white count is not elevated
   today at 7.8.
   -          Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**3-19**])
   -          Continue to follow with daily CXRs
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities,
   UCx, Blood Cx
s, and Femoral Tip Cx pending
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Will attempt to start low dose beta blocker today as BP tolerates
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and contact
   cards fellow.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula.
    -  Wean O2 as tolerated
    -  Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.
    - Continue to follow neurologic status
    - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm, although had some
   sinus pauses overnight.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Beta blocker could exacerbate sinus pauses, will hold off at this
   time
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  With bloody secretions from the back of his throat yesterday
   morning. HCT trending down 31->25, but stable this morning.
   - Will continue to check Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets improved to 160 today (from [**Age over 90 105**]
   yesterday).
   - Continue to monitor
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have a fresh thrombus in the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation (VFib) arrest and was resuscitated, receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for approximately 54 minutes. He was also treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using bare-metal stents (BMS) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the RCA. 

Currently, the patient is in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has been extubated. His vital signs are stable, with oxygen saturation on nasal cannula at 94-97%. The patient's temperature has trended down since starting antibiotics, and his white blood cell count is not elevated. He is currently receiving vancomycin and cefepime for probable pneumonia, with sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci and rods. His urine culture grew Group B Streptococcus.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are continuing to trend down, indicating improvement. He is off pressors and extubated, and his neurologic status is improving. His rhythm has transitioned from VFib to junctional rhythm and now he is in sinus rhythm. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and"

   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped; did diurese well overnight, but not at goal.  O2 requirement
   slowly decreasing.
   - Start Lasix 20mg po daily as LOS still positive 1.7 liters
   - Continually monitor for signs of decompensation as patient is more
   preload dependent secondary to RV infarct.
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenisin; consider adding
   mucomyst nebs today if not improved
   - Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
   - Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started secondary to concern for a developing
   pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Urine culture
   has grown Group B Strep. Sputum Cx: GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR with sensitivities pending. His
   white count is not elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever
   overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**4-16**]); will wait to
   narrow antibiotics until second set of sputum cultures have
            sensitivities as the first set is likely a contaminant.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: Moving in right direction both
   neurologically and hemodynamically

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) arrest, was successfully resuscitated, and extubated. He is currently stable with improving vital signs and oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula.

The patient's main issues include respiratory distress, fever, thrombocytopenia, neuro status, rhythm disturbances, acute systolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and liver dysfunction.

Respiratory Distress: The patient is still experiencing some respiratory distress, but his oxygen requirements are decreasing. He has rhonchi in his anterior lung fields and is producing minimal sputum. He continues to desaturate when supplemental oxygen is stopped. Lasix has been started to promote diuresis.

Fever: The patient has a fever, which was initially attributed to possible pneumonia. He is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The urine culture showed growth of Group B Strep, and the sputum culture revealed GPC sensitive to levofloxacin, oxacillin, and TMP-SMX. The next set of sputum culture sensitivities is pending.

Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased to 116 from 160"

   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started yesterday secondary to concern for a
   developing pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, and
   his fevers have trended down since beginning antibiotics.  Urine
   culture has grown Group B Strep. Sputum GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR, going to wait until those
   sensitivites are back to switch antibiotics. His white count is not
   elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**4-16**])
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities
   and Blood Cx
   -          Femoral Tip Cx: no growth
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped.
    -   Start Lasix 20mg Daily IV BID
   -   Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenisin; consider mucomyst
   if not expectorating sputum today.
    -   Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
    -   Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Continue Metroprolol 12.5 mg PO BID
   - Consider starting 20mg IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **]
   - FU I/O
   - If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and contact
   cards fellow.
   .
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.  Mild inattention and memory deficits that should be
   expected to improve with time  once toxic metabolic and infectious
   disturbances subside
    - Continue to follow neurologic status
    - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   - Neuro Rehab with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4727**]; [**Hospital 25**] Rehab Facility; will d/w
   case management.
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm, although had some
   sinus pauses overnight.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Start 12.5 mg Metroprolol SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Hold on diuresis for now, as patient is pre-load dependent
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  S/P significant nasal bleed secondary to NG tube trauma. HCT
   trended down, but stabilizing, initially 31->25, but 26.8 this morning.
   No signs of active bleeding.
   - Will continue to check Hct daily
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased to 116 today (from 160
   yesterday). No signs of active bleeding.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars. 138-140
   -          Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS
   # Mobility: Improving

","The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He was also found to have a thrombus in the mid-RCA and was treated with heparin and integrilin. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating ongoing improvement.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he continues to have difficulty breathing without supplemental oxygen and shows signs of possible pneumonia. He has been placed on antibiotics, and his fever has trended down. The sputum culture shows growth of Staphylococcus aureus, which is sensitive to oxacillin. The patient will continue to receive vancomycin and cefepime until the sensitivities are available.

The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mg/dL. His liver function tests are also within normal limits, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 66 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 76 U/L.

The patient's neurological status is improving, and he is answering questions appropriately. However, he exhibits mild inattention and memory deficits that should improve with time. His platelet count has decreased to 116,000/mm3, but there are no signs of active bleeding.

The patient's mobility is improving, and he is no longer bedbound. His blood sugar levels have been stable, ranging from 138 to 140 mg/dL.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, and he is expected to continue recovering. Close monitoring of his vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, liver function, and neurological status will be essential."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped; did diurese well overnight, but not at goal.  O2 requirement
   slowly decreasing.
   - Start Lasix 20mg po daily as LOS still positive 1.7 liters
   - Continually monitor for signs of decompensation as patient is more
   preload dependent secondary to RV infarct.
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenisin; consider adding
   mucomyst nebs today if not improved
   - Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
   - Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started secondary to concern for a developing
   pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Urine culture
   has grown Group B Strep. Sputum Cx: GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR with sensitivities pending. His
   white count is not elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever
   overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**4-16**]); will wait to
   narrow antibiotics until second set of sputum cultures have
            sensitivities as the first set is likely a contaminant.
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities
   and Blood Cx
   -          Will d/c foley today
   -          Femoral Tip Cx: no growth
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Increase Metroprolol  to 25 mg PO BID to HR<70
   - FU I/O
s- If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and
   contact cards fellow.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreased to 116 today (from 160
   yesterday). Started at 293 on admission. No signs of active bleeding.
   Concern for HIT Type 2 as day 5 of heparin
   - D/C heparin, will ambulate him in the meantime
   - Send HIT antibodies
   - Continue to monitor
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.  Mild inattention and memory deficits that should be
   expected to improve with time  once toxic metabolic and infectious
   disturbances subside
   - Continue to follow neurologic status
   - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   - Neuro Rehab with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4727**]; [**Hospital 25**] Rehab Facility; will d/w
   case management.
   - Outpatient sleep study for ?obstructive sleep apnea vs central cause
   of apnea
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm. Several brief
   apnic episodes overnight without desaturating.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Increased to 25 mg Metroprolol SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
    - Consider sleep study in outpatient for possible OSA.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  S/P significant nasal bleed secondary to NG tube trauma. HCT
   trended down, but stabilizing, initially 31->25, but 26.8 this morning.
   No signs of active bleeding.
   - Will continue to check Hct daily
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs

He presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation (VFib). He underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is now extubated and improving overall.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has stable vital signs and oxygen saturation on nasal cannula, but continues to desaturate when supplemental oxygen is stopped. He is actively coughing with small amounts of sputum expectorated. Lasix 20mg po daily should be started as the patient still has a positive fluid balance of 1.7 liters. Monitoring for signs of decompensation is important due to right ventricular (RV) infarct.
2. Fever: Antibiotics were started due to concern for developing pneumonia. The patient has been on vancomycin and cefepime. The urine culture grew Group B Strep, and the sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci (GPC) sensitive to levofloxacin, oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, but resistant to erythromycin and gentamicin.

","The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and diagonal branch, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was initially treated with aspirin, heparin, and intravenous nitroglycerin. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have a fresh thrombus in the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). A bare metal stent (BMS) was placed in the RCA. He experienced ventricular fibrillation (VFib) arrest, received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and was successfully defibrillated. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He was sedated and placed on a dopamine infusion. After stabilization, the patient was weaned off the ventilator and extubated. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, trazodone, ranitidine, and heparin. His blood cultures are pending. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and he is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. His white blood cell count is not elevated, but he had a fever overnight. The patient's sputum culture showed moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus and rare growth of gram-negative rods. His blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's serum troponin T levels are elevated. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

   GROWTH.
   CXR:
   The lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
   unchanged. However, there is new fullness in the hilar regions
   bilaterally and increase in interstitial markings suggesting new
   pulmonary edema above what would be expected for extubation. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are also evident. There is no pneumothorax.
   Retrocardiac density, likely atelectasis, is unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped. O2 requirement slowly decreasing. One episode of increased
   distress overnight with tachypnea; CXR shows no acute changes
possibly
   secondary to PNA plus atelectasis plus pulmonary edema plus effusions
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily as LOS still positive 395 cc.
   - Continually monitor for signs of decompensation as patient is more
   preload dependent secondary to RV infarct.
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenisin
   - Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
   - Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started secondary to concern for a developing
   pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Urine culture
   has grown Group B Strep. Sputum Cx: GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR with sensitivities pending. His
   white count is not elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever
   overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**5-17**]); will wait to
   narrow antibiotics until second set of sputum cultures have
            sensitivities as the first set is likely a contaminant.
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities
   and Blood Cx
s x 3
   -      Femoral Tip Cx: no growth
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Increase Metroprolol  to 25 mg PO BID to HR<70
   - FU I/O
s- If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and
   contact cards fellow.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets increased to 198 today (from [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday). Started at 293 on admission. No signs of active bleeding.
   Concern for HIT Type 2 as day 5 of heparin, so d/c
d yesterday.
   Improving off of heparin
   - Continue to hold heparin, will ambulate him in the meantime
   - Continue to monitor with daily cbc
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.  Mild inattention and memory deficits that should be
   expected to improve with time  once toxic metabolic and infectious
   disturbances subside
   - Neuro will likely sign off today as no other interventions needed at
   this time
   - Continue to follow neurologic status
   - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   - Neuro Rehab with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4727**]; [**Hospital 25**] Rehab Facility; will d/w
   case management.
   - Outpatient sleep study for ?obstructive sleep apnea vs central cause
   of apnea
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Increased to 25 mg Metroprolol SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
    - Consider sleep study in outpatient for possible OSA.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  S/P significant nasal bleed secondary to NG tube trauma. HCT
   trended down, but stabilizing, initially 31->25, but 26.8 this morning.
   No signs of active bleeding.
   - Will continue to check Hct daily
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars. 127-150
    -  Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia, who presented with STEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and received a bare metal stent in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a drug-eluting stent in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He is currently extubated and improving with stable vital signs. However, he continues to experience respiratory distress with wheezing and crackles on chest auscultation, suggesting possible pneumonia, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection, which is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The sputum culture shows sensitivity to levofloxacin and oxacillin, but resistance to erythromycin and gentamicin. The patient's platelet count is improving after starting intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. His neurologic status is improving, and he is expected to regain full consciousness soon. The patient's rhythm has stabilized in sinus rhythm, and his acute systolic congestive heart failure is managed with diuretics. His anemia is stable, and his liver function tests are trending down. The patient's blood sugar levels are within normal range."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped. O2 requirement slowly decreasing. One episode of increased
   distress overnight with tachypnea; CXR shows no acute changes
possibly
   secondary to PNA plus atelectasis plus pulmonary edema plus effusions
   - Switch to Lasix 20mg po BID as LOS still positive 395 cc, will
   monitor UOP on po Lasix
   - Continually monitor for signs of decompensation as patient is more
   preload dependent secondary to RV infarct.
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenesin
   - Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
   - Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started secondary to concern for a developing
   pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Urine culture
   has grown Group B Strep. Sputum Cx: GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR with sensitivities pending. His
   white count is not elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever
   overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**5-17**]); will wait to
   narrow antibiotics until second set of sputum cultures have
            sensitivities as the first set is likely a contaminant.
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities
   and Blood Cx

   -      Femoral Tip Cx: no growth
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   -          Vanc level low at 7.3, will re-dose Vanc
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Continue metroprolol at 25 mg PO BID to HR<70
   - FU I/O
s- If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and

   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets increased to 198 today (from [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday). Started at 293 on admission. No signs of active bleeding.
   Concern for HIT Type 2 as day 5 of heparin, so d/c
d yesterday.
   Improving off of heparin
   - Continue to hold heparin, will ambulate him in the meantime
   - Continue to monitor with daily cbc
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.  Mild inattention and memory deficits that should be
   expected to improve with time  once toxic metabolic and infectious
   disturbances subside
   - Neuro will likely sign off today as no other interventions needed at
   this time
   - Continue to follow neurologic status
   - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   - Neuro Rehab with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4727**]; [**Hospital 25**] Rehab Facility; will d/w
   case management.
   - Outpatient sleep study for ?obstructive sleep apnea vs central cause
   of apnea
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue 25 mg Metroprolol [**Hospital1 **] with SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
    - Consider sleep study in outpatient for possible OSA.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does appear slightly overloaded
   with crackles on physical exam.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  S/P significant nasal bleed secondary to NG tube trauma. HCT
   trended down, but stabilizing, initially 31->25, but 27.4 this morning.
   No signs of active bleeding.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with a STEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement in the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery. He experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest, was resuscitated, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 134/77 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on 3 liters nasal cannula, and temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F). The patient is alert and oriented, able to follow commands, and interactive.

The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi in the anterior lung fields, non-productive cough, no discrete areas of decreased breath sounds, and a foul odor coming from the mouth. The patient's extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Neurologically, the patient is improving, with mild inattention and memory deficits expected to improve with time.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped. O2 requirement slowly decreasing. One episode of increased
   distress overnight with tachypnea; CXR shows no acute changes
possibly
   secondary to PNA plus atelectasis plus pulmonary edema plus effusions
   - Switch to Lasix 20mg po BID as LOS still positive 395 cc, will
   monitor UOP on po Lasix
   - Continually monitor for signs of decompensation as patient is more
   preload dependent secondary to RV infarct.
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenesin
   - Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
   - Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started secondary to concern for a developing
   pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Urine culture
   has grown Group B Strep. Sputum Cx: GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR with sensitivities pending. His
   white count is not elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever
   overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**5-17**]); will wait to
   narrow antibiotics until second set of sputum cultures have
            sensitivities as the first set is likely a contaminant.
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities
   and Blood Cx
s x 3
   -      Femoral Tip Cx: no growth
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   -          Vanc level low at 7.3, will re-dose Vanc
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Continue metroprolol at 25 mg PO BID to HR<70
   - FU I/O
s- If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and
   contact cards fellow.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets increased to 198 today (from [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday). Started at 293 on admission. No signs of active bleeding.
   Concern for HIT Type 2 as day 5 of heparin, so d/c
d yesterday.
   Improving off of heparin
   - Continue to hold heparin, will ambulate him in the meantime
   - Continue to monitor with daily cbc
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.  Mild inattention and memory deficits that should be
   expected to improve with time  once toxic metabolic and infectious
   disturbances subside
   - Neuro will likely sign off today as no other interventions needed at
   this time
   - Continue to follow neurologic status
   - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   - Neuro Rehab with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4727**]; [**Hospital 25**] Rehab Facility; will d/w
   case management.
   - Outpatient sleep study for ?obstructive sleep apnea vs central cause
   of apnea
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue 25 mg Metroprolol [**Hospital1 **] with SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
    - Consider sleep study in outpatient for possible OSA.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does appear slightly overloaded
   with crackles on physical exam.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  S/P significant nasal bleed secondary to NG tube trauma. HCT
   trended down, but stabilizing, initially 31->25, but 27.4 this morning.
   No signs of active bleeding.
   - Will continue to check Hct daily
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars. 127-150
    -  Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia who presented with a STEMI. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and was treated with heparin and integrilin. The patient experienced respiratory distress and was extubated. He also had an episode of nausea and fever, leading to the suspicion of pneumonia. Antibiotics were started, and sputum cultures were collected. The patient's platelet count decreased, and he developed thrombocytopenia. Heparin was discontinued due to a possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type 2. The patient's neurologic status improved, and he remains in sinus rhythm. His cardiac enzymes continue to trend down, indicating improvement in the STEMI. The patient has mild inattention and memory deficits but is expected to improve with time. He has signs of fluid overload and is being closely monitored for signs of congestive heart failure. His anemia is improving, and his liver function tests are normalizing. His blood sugar levels are within the target range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as cough and fever, along with the presence of foul-smelling sputum, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The sputum culture showed growth of Gram-positive cocci sensitive to levofloxacin, oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, which indicates a possible infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o CAD s/p DES to the LAD and D1, and
   hyperlipidemia, who presented from [**Hospital3 519**] with STEMI.  He is
   now s/p Vfib arrest, was coded for approximately 54 minutes and is s/p
   cardiac cath with BMS to the RCA.  He has been extubated and is overall
   improving.
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress:  Patient now extubated and with stable vital
   signs and O2 sats on nasal cannula. Active cough with small amounts of
   sputum expectorated. Continues to desat when supplemental O2 is
   stopped. O2 requirement slowly decreasing. One episode of increased
   distress overnight with tachypnea; CXR shows no acute changes
possibly
   secondary to PNA plus atelectasis plus pulmonary edema plus effusions
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily as LOS still positive 395 cc.
   - Continually monitor for signs of decompensation as patient is more
   preload dependent secondary to RV infarct.
   - Continue Ipratroprium Nebs Q6Hrs and guafenisin
   - Chest PT and wean O2 as tolerated
   - Will continue to treat possible pneumonia
   # Fever: Antibiotics were started secondary to concern for a developing
   pneumonia.  He was started on vancomycin and cefepime. Urine culture
   has grown Group B Strep. Sputum Cx: GPC sensitive to levofloxacin,
   oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, resistant to erythro and gent.  The next day's
   sputum gram stain showed GPC and GPR with sensitivities pending. His
   white count is not elevated today at 7.4, but did spike a fever
   overnight;
   -       Continue Vanc/Cefepime today (today is day [**5-17**]); will wait to
   narrow antibiotics until second set of sputum cultures have
            sensitivities as the first set is likely a contaminant.
   -          F/u with final reads of sputum culture with sensitivities
   and Blood Cx
s x 3
   -      Femoral Tip Cx: no growth
   -          Antibiotic approval received
   -          Vanc level low at 7.3, will re-dose Vanc
   # STEMI: He was found to have STe in II, III, AVF, and after one hour
   of resuscitiation, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated a
   fresh thrombus in the mid-RCA.  Heparin and integrilin gtts were held
   secondary to nose bleed. He has been cooled and rewarmed.  Cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend down this morning. Patient status improving,
   now off pressors and extubated.
   - Continue to monitor blood pressures.  If low BP, will bolus with
   IVF.  Have stopped continuous IVF.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily
   - Continue Lipitor 80 po mg daily
   - Increase Metroprolol  to 25 mg PO BID to HR<70
   - FU I/O
s- If pt develops pulmonary edema, will consider acute MR and
   contact cards fellow.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Platelets increased to 198 today (from [**Age over 90 **]
   yesterday). Started at 293 on admission. No signs of active bleeding.
   Concern for HIT Type 2 as day 5 of heparin, so d/c
d yesterday.
   Improving off of heparin
   - Continue to hold heparin, will ambulate him in the meantime
   - Continue to monitor with daily cbc
   #Neuro Status: Patient answering questions and neurologic status
   improving.  Neuro has removed the EEG and feel that he has an
   encephalopathy that may be secondary to sedation or metabolic
   disturbances.  Mild inattention and memory deficits that should be
   expected to improve with time  once toxic metabolic and infectious
   disturbances subside
   - Neuro will likely sign off today as no other interventions needed at
   this time
   - Continue to follow neurologic status
   - If focal deficits develop, will consider CT head
   - Neuro Rehab with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4727**]; [**Hospital 25**] Rehab Facility; will d/w
   case management.
   - Outpatient sleep study for ?obstructive sleep apnea vs central cause
   of apnea
   # RHYTHM:  The patient presented in VFib arrest and then had a
   junctional rhythm.  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry.
    - Continue 25 mg Metroprolol SBP >90.
    - Continue to replete K > 4.0 and Mg > 2.0
    - Consider sleep study in outpatient for possible OSA.
   # Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  He does not have a known
   history of CHF, per our records, and these elevated filling pressures
   seen in the cath lab are most likely [**3-14**] his acute RV infarct.
   Currently stable disease as patient does not appear fluid overloaded.
    - TTE with LVEF > 55% without wall motion abnormalities is encouraging
   for minimal disease
    - Will continue to follow for signs of fluid overload, and diurese as
   needed
   .
   # Anemia:  S/P significant nasal bleed secondary to NG tube trauma. HCT
   trended down, but stabilizing, initially 31->25, but 27.4 this morning.
   No signs of active bleeding.
   - Will continue to check Hct daily
   - Transfuse if Hct <21
   - Active type/screen and crossmatch
   - Continue Afrin NS as needed
   - Consider ENT C/S if bleeding starts again
    #Shock Liver: LFTs continue to trend down. Normal INR.
   - Continue to monitor daily LFTs
   .
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars. 127-150
    -  Continue sliding scale today and continue to monitor FSBS

- The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyperlipidemia.
- He presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and drug-eluting stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA).
- The patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VFib) arrest and was resuscitated.
- He is currently extubated and improving, with stable vital signs and oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula.
- The patient is showing signs of respiratory distress, possibly secondary to pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary edema, and effusions.
- His white blood cell count is not elevated, but he has had episodes of fever.
- Blood cultures have grown Group B Strep, and sputum cultures have shown Gram-positive cocci sensitive to levofloxacin, oxacillin, and TMP-SMX, but resistant to erythromycin and gentamicin.
- The patient's platelet count has improved from admission levels.
- He is at risk for thrombocytopenia due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT 2).
- The patient's neurologic status is improving, with mild inattention and memory deficits expected to improve with"
