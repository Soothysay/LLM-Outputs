   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to the CCU
   for recurrent a fib with [**Age over 90 1427**].
   .
   # A fib:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She had taken
   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with [**Last Name (STitle) 1427**], TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.
   - Patient may not be able to have TEE/DCCV today because of holiday
   (unless she is unstable) so will call anesthesia to see availability
   today
   - Will continue amio overnight and if does not convert will likely be
   able to get TEE/cardioversion tomorrorw
   - continue systemic HTN with heparin gtt
   .
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF.  Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume
   resuscitation in the ED on admission.
   - 40mg of IV lasix PRN as still with O2 requirement
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No previous cath, no previous history of MI.
   - ROMI
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypertension:  On recent admission lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol
   and HCTZ were discontinued.  Will monitor blood pressures with [**Last Name (STitle) 1427**].
   Likely will not need antihypertensives.
   - Will restart beta blockers as tolerated
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  A febrile, no subjective fevers.  No clear sign of
   infection on CXR or UA.  As the patient has been admitted recently,
   will consider C diff if develops diarrhea.  Likely stress reaction, as
   noted on previous admission as well.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation. She has been started on amiodarone drip and bolus, but her heart rate did not change, and she developed nausea. The patient also had hematuria in the foley catheter, likely due to trauma. Her O2 saturation was 91-93 on 6L, and a repeat chest X-ray showed hilar fullness.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 121 bpm with a range of 120-147 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/64 mmHg to 124/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute with a range of 18-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her heart rhythm remains in atrial flutter at a rate of around 125.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 45.6 g/dL, platelet count of 368 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-T level below 0.01 ng/mL, and blood glucose of 117 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has leukocytosis, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to the CCU
   for recurrent a fib with RVR.
   .
   # A fib:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She had taken
   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.
   - Patient may not be able to have TEE/DCCV today because of holiday
   (unless she is unstable) so will call anesthesia to see availability
   today
   - Will continue amio overnight and if does not convert will likely be
   able to get TEE/cardioversion tomorrorw
   - continue systemic HTN with heparin gtt
   .
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF.  Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume
   resuscitation in the ED on admission.
   - 40mg of IV lasix PRN as still with O2 requirement
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No previous cath, no previous history of MI.
   - ROMI
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypertension:  On recent admission lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol
   and HCTZ were discontinued.  Will monitor blood pressures with RVR.
   Likely will not need antihypertensives.
   - Will restart beta blockers as tolerated
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  A febrile, no subjective fevers.  No clear sign of
   infection on CXR or UA.  As the patient has been admitted recently,
   will consider C diff if develops diarrhea.  Likely stress reaction, as
   noted on previous admission as well.
   - Monitor daily

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis and has had an increase in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR. She has been on amiodarone, but recently discontinued and restarted it following DC cardioversion.

The patient did not tolerate esmolol drip due to hypotension overnight. It is mentioned that the patient may not be able to undergo transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or direct current cardioversion (DCCV) today because of the holiday, unless she becomes unstable. Therefore, the plan is to continue amiodarone overnight and if the patient does not convert, she will likely be able to undergo TEE/cardioversion tomorrow. Heparin gtt will be continued for systemic hypertension.

The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) but preserved ejection fraction (EF). She had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the emergency department (ED) on admission. As a result, 40mg of IV lasix will be given as needed, and the patient will be monitored for pulmonary edema, with treatment using PRN lasix.

There is no previous history of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction (MI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She underwent TEE/DCCV yesterday and has been in normal sinus rhythm since then. She will continue amiodarone for rate/rhythm control and systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, transitioning to warfarin. The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction. Her exam is consistent with pulmonary edema and extremity swelling, attributed to tachycardia and decreased filling. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, with a fever overnight but unclear source of infection. There is concern for aspiration given her couch position, and further evaluation for pneumonia is recommended. The patient also has acute renal failure secondary to poor forward flow and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's elevated leukocyte count and fever suggest a possible infection, which could be due to aspiration given her couch position. Further evaluation for pneumonia is recommended.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and exam findings consistent with pulmonary edema indicate a possible complication related to her cardiac condition.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function tests indicate secondary acute renal failure, likely due to poor forward flow and hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography and direct current cardioversion (TEE/DCCV) yesterday, resulting in persistent sinus rhythm. She is currently on amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm and systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction. She had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the ED on admission. Lasix has been prescribed as needed for pulmonary edema, and monitoring for pulmonary edema is ongoing.

The patient's coronary history is unremarkable, with no previous catheterization or history of myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes have been negative. Aspirin therapy will be continued.

Hypertension management involved the discontinuation of lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol, and HCTZ on recent admission. Blood pressures will be monitored with RVR, and beta-blockers may be restarted as tolerated.

Leukocytosis is present, with a fever overnight but no clear source of infection. A chest X-ray showed no infiltrates, and urinalysis was clean. The patient will be monitored for signs of infection, and antibiotics may be started"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been on amiodarone in the past, but it was discontinued and recently restarted following DC cardioversion. No clear cause for the increased occurrences of atrial fibrillation with RVR has been identified, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels on the last admission were within normal range. Urinalysis (UA) and chest X-ray (CXR) today showed no signs of infection, although the patient does have leukocytosis.

The patient did not tolerate esmolol drip due to hypotension overnight. It is uncertain if the patient will be able to undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)/direct current cardioversion (DCCV) today due to a holiday (unless she becomes unstable), so anesthesia will be called to determine availability. If the patient does not convert overnight, it is likely that TEE/cardioversion will be performed tomorrow. The patient will continue receiving amiodarone overnight and systemic hypertension with heparin gtt.

The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) but preserved ejection fraction (EF). The patient had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the emergency department (ED) on admission. To address this, the patient will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been taking amiodarone in the past but discontinued and recently restarted following DC cardioversion. No clear cause has been identified for the increased occurrences of atrial fibrillation with RVR. The patient did not tolerate esmolol drip due to hypotension overnight. The plan is to continue amio overnight and if conversion does not occur, attempt transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)/cardioversion tomorrow. The patient will also continue systemic heparin gtt for anticoagulation. 

Other findings include leukocytosis, diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) but preserved ejection fraction (EF), and evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the ED on admission. The patient requires supplemental oxygen and is being monitored for pulmonary edema, which will be treated with PRN lasix. 

The patient has a history of hypertension but all antihypertensive medications were discontinued during the recent admission. Blood pressures will be monitored with RVR and beta blockers will be restarted as tolerated. The patient is also being monitored for leukocytosis, which could be a stress reaction or infection. Prophylaxis measures include DVT ppx with heparin drip, pain management with ty"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been taking amiodarone recently, which was restarted after DC cardioversion. No clear cause for the increased occurrences of atrial fibrillation with RVR has been identified. The patient did not tolerate esmolol drip due to hypotension overnight. It is planned to continue amiodarone overnight and attempt transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and cardioversion tomorrow if necessary. The patient will also continue systemic heparinization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing recurrent episodes. This condition can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. If left untreated, it may result in stroke or other cardiovascular complications.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension overnight while receiving an esmolol drip. This can be a complication of the medication or the underlying atrial fibrillation itself. Close monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure is essential to maintain adequate organ perfusion.

3. Volume Overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the emergency department. This can lead to symptoms such as pulmonary edema, peripheral edema"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to the CCU
   for recurrent a fib with RVR.
   # A fib:  Unclear precipitant. Only hint is leukocytosis but no orhter
   localizing symptoms. UA and CXR inconsistnt with infection. WBCs have
   been stable over last weeks. S/P recent DCCV and amiodarone.
   - S/p TEE/DCCV yesterday with persistent NSR following.
   - Will continue amio for rate/rhythm cntr
   - continue systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt; will transition
   to warfarin and touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF. Exam conssitent with pulmonary edema and extremity swelling. This
   is attriuted to the tachycardia and decreased filling in this setting.
   CXR shows pulmonary effusion.
   - 40mg of IV lasix PRN as still with O2 requirement,
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.
   # Leukocytosis:  Pt had a fever overnight to 100.6, however unclear
   source of infection.  CXR no infiltrate however unclear given large
   amount of pulmonary edema, may have underlying infection. Concern for
   aspiration given her couch.
   - consider PA LAT and sputum studies to eval for PNA
   - will send c diff if diarrhea
   - s/s consult ? aspiration
   - if remains febrile or if worsended WBC or if PNA on CXR will add abx
   for aspiration.
   # ARF:  Secondary to poor forward flow and hypotension.   Will monitor
   [**Hospital1 7**]
   # CORONARIES:  No previous cath, no previous history of MI.  Cardiac
   enzymes never positive
   - Continue aspirin
   # Hypertension:  Has been stable overnight.
   - Will restart beta blockers as tolerated
   FEN:  Cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip, home ranitidine
   -Pain managment with tylenol

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram/direct current cardioversion (TEE/DCCV) yesterday and is currently in normal sinus rhythm. She will continue taking amiodarone for rate/rhythm control and systemic anticoagulation with heparin. The patient also has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction, and she is experiencing symptoms consistent with pulmonary edema and extremity swelling. This is attributed to the tachycardia and decreased filling in this setting. A chest X-ray shows pulmonary effusion. She is being treated with IV lasix as needed for pulmonary edema. The patient has leukocytosis and a fever overnight, but the source of infection is unclear. A chest X-ray does not show any infiltrates, but there may be an underlying infection. There is concern for aspiration given her couch position. Further evaluation with PA LAT and sputum studies is being considered to evaluate for possible pneumonia. If she remains febrile or if her white blood cell count worsens, or if pneumonia is present on the chest X-ray, antibiotics for aspiration will be added. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure secondary to poor forward flow and hypotension. She has no previous history of"
