","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with painless jaundice over the past month. He has a history of elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and bilirubin levels. A liver biopsy showed hepatocyte necrosis, which could be related to viral or drug-induced causes. The patient's condition has worsened, with an increase in creatinine levels and an elevated INR of 2.5. An ultrasound revealed GB wall thickening with ascites. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, but he has abnormal liver function tests and renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver failure, acute renal failure, and potential urinary retention. The patient's liver failure is of unclear etiology, and further evaluation is needed, including follow-up serologies, transplantation recommendations, and consultation with a renal transplant team. The patient's acute renal failure may also require intervention, such as the placement of a Foley catheter to assess for urinary retention. Additionally, the patient's nutritional needs should be addressed with a diet plan for enteral nutrition (FEN)."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was present with the ICU team for
   key portions of the services provided. I would add the following: 45 yo
   male with onset of painless jaundice over the past 6 weeks with
   development of liver cirrhosis. Development of coagulopathy and renal
   failure over the past 2 weeks.  Minimal change in urine output with
   IVF- Foley placed. Etiology of liver cirrhosis possibly toxin vs. viral
   by OSH biopsy. Undergoing transplant eval and re-review of path slides.
   Appears appropriate for floor transfer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with painless jaundice over the past month. Initial laboratory tests showed elevated AST and ALT levels, along with an increased total bilirubin level of 26. Negative hep serologies were obtained, and a hepatologist recommended a biopsy. The biopsy revealed hepatocyte necrosis, which could be consistent with viral or drug-induced liver injury. Over the last two weeks, the patient's creatinine level has been increasing, and the INR has risen to 2.5. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated gallbladder wall thickening with ascites. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 152/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical examination findings include jaundice and crackles at the left base of the chest. Laboratory results show elevated levels of AST, ALT, total bilirubin, BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes such as PT/PTT/INR. The patient's blood glucose level is 71 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels are within normal range. The assessment and plan include liver failure with unclear etiology, acute renal failure, and nutritional support. The patient is being evaluated for liver transplant and has been transferred to the floor.
