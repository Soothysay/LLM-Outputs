   Assessment and Plan
   84-year-old man with a history of 4-vessel CABG in [**2185**], EF 35% with
   ICD placed in [**2194**], severe AS (area 0.6 cm2, gradient 33 mmHg) s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**5-/2197**], was transferred from OSH for heart failure
   with severe AS.
   .
   # VALVES: critical AS
   - check echo
   - metoprolol IV prn for HR goal of 60s
   - discuss valvuloplasty utility with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3213**] and family
   - avoid aggressive diuresis, avoid venodilators
   .
   # PUMP: CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema, leading to respiratory
   failure requiring intubation. Goal I/O by morning: -500 mL.
   - monitor I/O closely; furosemide IV prn as needed, but only gently
   given severe AS
   .
   # CORONARIES: resolving subendocardial ischemia. ECG with no ischemic
   changes. Elevated troponin, with non-elevated CK, likely due to CHF
   exacerbation, severe AS, and concurrent renal failure.
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue ASA 325 for now; will decrease to 81 mg once ACS ruled out
   - restart BB if BP and HR tolerate
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus, HR in 60s
   - BB if HR > 70
   .
   # Small bowel inflammation: with wall thickening. ?perforated
   diverticilum. Not surgical candidate.
   - serial abd exams
   - continue pip-tazo at least until WBC normalizes
   - appreciate surgical input
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely for renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor
   forward flow. Might also be due to contrast nephropathy from recent abd
   CT.
   - check urine lytes
   - monitor urine output closely
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: likely due to hypoperfusion in setting of CHF and
   severe AS.
   - trend LFTs; fractionate bili
   - RUQ u/s if not already done at OSH
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 32 now, 39 in [**Month (only) 11**]. MCV in the 90s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of heart conditions, including 4-vessel CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He also has severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a valve area of 0.6 cm2 and a gradient of 33 mmHg. The patient was admitted for heart failure with severe AS and required intubation due to respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe AS, which is causing symptoms of heart failure. The valve area is significantly narrowed, leading to impaired blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body.
2. Exacerbation of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF has worsened, resulting in pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. This is indicated by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury/Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by elevated serum creatinine and urea levels, as well as decreased urine output.
4. Subendocardial Ischemia: The patient experienced an episode of subendocardial ischemia, likely due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This is supported by elevated cardiac enzymes and the patient's history of coronary artery disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old man with a medical history of 4-vessel CABG, EF 35% with ICD placed, severe aortic stenosis (AS) who presented with heart failure and severe AS. He was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/53 to 98/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 9 cm, point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, and a soft systolic murmur.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are within normal range except for hypernatremia. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and low urine output.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation.
2. Critical AS with plans for a transthor"

 AORTIC STENOSIS
   84-year-old man with a history of 4-vessel CABG in [**2185**], EF 35% with
   ICD placed in [**2194**], severe AS (area 0.6 cm2, gradient 33 mmHg) s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**5-/2197**], was transferred from OSH for heart failure
   with severe AS.
   .
   # PUMP: acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema [**2-5**] AS, leading to
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   -          monitor I/O closely; furosemide 10 IV prn as needed, but
   only gently given severe AS
   -          goal neg 500 today
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus, HR in 60s
   - BB if HR > 70
   .
   # VALVES: critical AS
   - TTE today
   - metoprolol IV prn for HR goal of 60s
   - discuss valvuloplasty utility with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3213**] and family on Monday
   - gentle diuresis: net 24 hour goal of -500cc
   .
   # CORONARIES: resolving subendocardial ischemia. ECG with no ischemic
   changes. Elevated troponin, with non-elevated CK, likely due to CHF
   exacerbation, severe AS, and concurrent renal failure.
   - continue ASA 325 for now; will consider decreasing to 81 mg
   - restart BB if BP and HR tolerate
   .
   # ARF: likely renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor forward flow. Might
   also be due to contrast nephropathy from recent abd CT. FeBUN = 23 <
   50% (suggestive of prerenal etiology).
   - monitor urine output closely
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA: Likely free water deficit from decreased PO intake.
   Free water deficit ~4L.
   - D5W @100cc/hr
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # SMALL BOWEL INFLAMMATION: ?perforated diverticulum. Not surgical
   candidate.
   - serial abd exams
   - continue pip-tazo for 14-day course (through [**2198-1-15**])
   - consider restarting TPN
   .
   # TRANSAMINITIS: likely due to hypoperfusion in setting of CHF and
   severe AS.
   - trend LFTs; fractionate bili
   - RUQ u/s ordered
   .
   # AMS: possibly [**2-5**] oversedation (fentanyl/midazolam) and
   hypernatremia.
   - will slowly correct hypernatremia
   - decrease fentanyl and midazolam dose to half
   .
   # ANEMIA: Hct 32 now, 39 in [**Month (only) 11**]. Combined iron-deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease.
   - monitor Hct

   84-year-old man with a history of 4-vessel CABG in [**2185**], EF 35% with
   ICD placed in [**2194**], severe AS (area 0.6 cm2, gradient 33 mmHg) s/p
   valvuloplasty in [**5-/2197**], was transferred from OSH for heart failure
   with severe AS.
   .
   # PUMP: acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema [**2-5**] AS, leading to
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   - monitor I/O closely; furosemide IV prn as needed, but only gently
   given severe AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus, HR in 60s
   - BB if HR > 70
   .
   # VALVES: critical AS
   - TTE today
   - metoprolol IV prn for HR goal of 60s
   - discuss valvuloplasty utility with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3213**] and family on Monday
   - gentle diuresis: net 24 hour goal of -500cc
   .
   # CORONARIES: resolving subendocardial ischemia. ECG with no ischemic
   changes. Elevated troponin, with non-elevated CK, likely due to CHF
   exacerbation, severe AS, and concurrent renal failure.
   - continue ASA 325 for now; will consider decreasing to 81 mg
   - restart BB if BP and HR tolerate
   .
   # ARF: likely renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor forward flow. Might
   also be due to contrast nephropathy from recent abd CT. FeBUN = 23 <
   50% (suggestive of prerenal etiology).
   - monitor urine output closely
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA: Likely free water deficit from decreased PO intake.
   Free water deficit ~4L.
   - D5W @100cc/hr
   - check PM electrolytes
   .
   # SMALL BOWEL INFLAMMATION: ?perforated diverticulum. Not surgical
   candidate.
   - serial abd exams
   - continue pip-tazo for 14-day course (through [**2198-1-15**])
   - consider restarting TPN
   .
   # TRANSAMINITIS: likely due to hypoperfusion in setting of CHF and
   severe AS.
   - trend LFTs; fractionate bili
   - RUQ u/s ordered
   .
   # AMS: possibly [**2-5**] oversedation (fentanyl/midazolam) and
   hypernatremia.
   - will slowly correct hypernatremia
   - decrease fentanyl and midazolam dose to half
   .
   # ANEMIA: Hct 32 now, 39 in [**Month (only) 11**]. Combined iron-deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of 4-vessel CABG, EF 35%, and severe AS who was admitted to the ICU for heart failure with pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has been diagnosed with acute CHF exacerbation, critical AS, resolving subendocardial ischemia, likely renal hypoperfusion, hypernatremia, small bowel inflammation, transaminitis, oversedation, and anemia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/43 to 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 24. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 262 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 27 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -3 mEq/L, and lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) level of 32.7%, platelet count of 278 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 32.0 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.1 mg/dL, glucose level of 141 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 3.45 ng/mL, total bilirubin (T Bili) level of 4.3 mg/dL, lactic acid level of 0.9 mmol/L, albumin level of 2.9 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 402 IU/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 8.2 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 3.0 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) level of 3.7 mg/dL. The patient's plan includes monitoring I/O closely, administering furosemide IV prn for acute CHF exacerbation, controlling heart rate, evaluating valvuloplasty utility, gently diuresing, and considering TPN. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of 4-vessel CABG, EF 35%, and ICD placement. He has severe aortic stenosis (AS) and was previously treated with valvuloplasty. The patient presented with heart failure exacerbation and pulmonary edema, leading to respiratory failure and intubation. He also has small bowel inflammation, possibly due to a perforated diverticulum, and hypernatremia. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute CHF exacerbation, critical AS, resolving subendocardial ischemia, renal failure, hypernatremia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute CHF exacerbation: The patient's heart failure has worsened, leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring intubation. Close monitoring of I/O and administration of furosemide IV as needed are recommended.

2. Critical AS: The patient has severe aortic stenosis, which is causing reduced blood flow to vital organs. TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) should be performed, and discussion of valvuloplasty utility with the cardiologist is necessary.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated BUN levels and non-elevated creatinine. Close monitoring of urine output and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be required.

4. Small bowel inflammation: The patient has signs of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old man with a history of 4-vessel CABG, EF 35%, and severe AS who was admitted for heart failure exacerbation with pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute CHF, renal failure, hypernatremia, fever, small bowel inflammation, transaminitis, oversedation, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute CHF Exacerbation: The patient's current condition includes acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation. Close monitoring of I/O and administration of furosemide are recommended.

2. Severe Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has critical AS with aortic area of 0.7cm2. Valvuloplasty utility should be discussed with Dr. [Last Name] and the family on Monday. Metoprolol IV prn for HR goal of 60s should be continued.

3. Renal Failure: The patient likely has renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor forward flow and possible contrast nephropathy from recent abdominal CT. Monitoring urine output closely and administering D5W at 100cc/hr are advised.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of approximately 4L. D5W at 100cc/hr should be continued, and PM electrolytes should be"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute on chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with pulmonary edema due to severe aortic stenosis (AS). The patient has a history of 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placed in [**2194**]. The patient also underwent valvuloplasty for severe AS in [**5-/2197**]. The current presentation includes acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema, leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation.

2. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 285 K/uL and a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. These values suggest impaired renal function. The patient's renal failure may be secondary to poor forward flow due to severe AS, as well as contrast nephropathy from a recent abdominal CT.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high serum sodium level of 145 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. This could be due to a free water deficit from decreased oral intake. The estimated free water deficit is approximately 4 L. The patient is receiving D5W at 100 cc/hr to address this electrolyte imbalance.

   # PUMP: acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema
   [**2-5**] AS, leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation. Has been
   net positive by number, though hard to assess given insensible losses
   from fevers.
   - strict I/O

   # RHYTHM: sinus, HR in 60s
   - on metoprolol, IV PRN hold if HR <60
   .
   # VALVES: critical AS
   - TTE showed LVEF 35-40%, Aortic area of 0.7cm2 (1/3/9)
   - metoprolol IV prn for HR goal of 60s
   - discuss valvuloplasty utility with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3213**] and family on Monday
   - gentle diuresis: net 24 hour goal of -500cc
   .
   # CORONARIES: resolving subendocardial ischemia. ECG with no ischemic
   changes. Elevated troponin, with non-elevated CK, likely due to CHF
   exacerbation, severe AS, and concurrent renal failure.
   - continue ASA 325 for now; will consider decreasing to 81 mg
   - restart BB if BP and HR tolerate
   .
   # ARF: likely renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor forward flow. Might
   also be due to contrast nephropathy from recent abd CT. FeBUN = 23 <
   50% (suggestive of prerenal etiology).
   - monitor urine output closely
   .
   # HYPERNATREMIA: Likely free water deficit from decreased PO intake.
   Free water deficit ~4L.
   - D5W @100cc/hr
   - check PM electrolytes

   # Fever: unclear source, temp started [**2197-1-5**], cultures sent, pt on
   zosyn. Possible relation to small bowel infection vs other infection;
   foley with hematuria. Mid-line removed [**1-6**]- tip sent for cx.
   -pan culture this AM- sputum, urine, blood
   -low threshold for broader abx coverage
   -replace foley
   -PICC not to be placed until no fever

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of CHF and severe aortic stenosis (AS). The patient also had small bowel perforation/peritonitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated due to pulmonary edema resulting from acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with severe AS. Close monitoring of respiratory support is essential.
2. Renal failure: The patient has likely renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor forward flow due to severe AS and concurrent renal failure. Monitoring urine output and managing fluid balance carefully is important.
3. Infection: The patient has fever without a clear source. Cultures have been sent, and he is currently on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Possible sources of infection include small bowel infection or other sources. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be considered, and Foley catheter replacement should be done.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to decreased PO intake. A free water deficit of ~4L is estimated, and D5W at 100cc/hr has been ordered. Regular monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes possibly due to hypoperfusion in the setting"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4, chronic systolic heart failure (EF 35%) post-implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), severe aortic stenosis (AS) with an area of 0.6 cm2 and gradient of 33 mmHg, who was transferred from another hospital for acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) with severe AS in the setting of likely small bowel perforation/peritonitis.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of systolic CHF with pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The patient's condition is unstable, with ongoing positive fluid balance, fever, and hematuria despite irrigation of the Foley catheter. There is a concern for ongoing renal hypoperfusion secondary to poor forward flow.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. PUMP: Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation.
2. RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 60s, on metoprolol IV prn for heart rate control.
3. VALVES: Critical AS - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF"

He also has chronic systolic heart failure (EF 35%) with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) requiring valvuloplasty. The patient presented with an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure due to severe AS and likely small bowel perforation/peritonitis.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, heart failure (acute on chronic), impaired physical mobility, and aortic stenosis. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/50-164/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing metoprolol, gentle diuresis, and discussing valvuloplasty utility with a cardiologist. He is also receiving antibiotics for suspected infection and has ongoing monitoring of various parameters"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 35%), and severe aortic stenosis. He presented with acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and likely small bowel perforation/peritonitis. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to an exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure and severe aortic stenosis. Weaning from mechanical ventilation has been unsuccessful so far. Close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status are crucial.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and the current acute exacerbation may lead to further deterioration of cardiac function. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac output is essential.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained, and the source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's hem"
