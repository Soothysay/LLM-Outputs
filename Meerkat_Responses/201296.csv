   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 70 yoF w/ a h/o CHF EF 20%, DMII, CAD , PVD, HTN, COPD, and
   CKD w/ a baseline Cr of 2.0 found unresponsive by her husband.
   [**Name (NI) 440**]:
   .
   # MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: patient initially found to be unresponsive by
   husband- seems as though she had been lethargic for at least 10 days.
   She also has been profoundly hypothyroid in the past and also
   alzheimers dementia with fluctuating mental status.  She was found with
   very low glucose. She is awake, but not following commands. Sometimes
   can be verbal.  TSH 36, borderline cardiac enzymes (0.21) in the
   setting of acute renal failure over CKD. Patient did not responded to
   narcan and now has a negative serum tox with a pending urine tox. She
   has been hemodinamically stable.
   - Follow urine tox
   - Increase levothyroxine
   - Treat renal failure (see below)
   - Monitor hemodinamics
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Most likely in the setting of fasting, being down
   and with low sugar. Hemodinamics and vital signs do not suggest
   infection. Awaiting culture data. No data to support cardiogenic shock
   with tissue ischemia or abdominal pain and mesenteric ischemia. Lactate
   3.3.
   - continue to trend lactate
   - treat infectious causes as above.
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; UA with
   proteinuria and trace keytones. Patient on diuretics before admission,
   so FeUrea more accurate and pointing to pre-renal. There were no castas
   in the urine to suggest ATN.
   .
   # FEVER: u/a negative, blood cultures sent.  CXR and non contrast CT
   abdomen / pelvis.  F/u blood cultures.
   -given mental status changes and inability to do an LP would feel
   compelled to treat for meningitis.  She has been given Ceftriaxone and
   vancomycin in the ED at meningitis doses and we will add ampicillin as
   well.  No other clear source for infection however given elevated
   lactate.  Given no clear GI source will d/c flagyl.
   -continue to monitor fever curve
   -has gotten 3L fluid to decrease lactate but never was hypotensive, has
   an EF of 20%, will hold off on additional fluids
   -vancomycin, given renal failure will need to dose renally- given 1x
   dose, check level in a.m. and dose per level
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly from hypotension given elevated lactate,
   although never recorded hypotension.  Continue to trend.  RUQ
   ultrasound normal.
   -obtain abd ultrasound with doppler
   -given hep C, acute viral hepatitis is a possibility, not in acute
   phase of hep C but could be superimposed hep A or hep B, send hep A IgG
   and IgM and Hep B antibody panel.
   -tylenol level not elevated
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: send B12, and folate but could also be
   hypothyroidism.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: not eating lately and previously had been on insulin.
   Will continue to monitor for hypoglycemia but unclear why she had a
   finger stick glucose of 20.  It is possible that this was erroneous as
   she is not on any glucose lowering medications and the glucose levels
   below 70 or so are not very accurate on finger stick glucometers.
   -continue to monitor, if hypoglycemic will send a serum glucose,
   insulin level and C peptide level
   -q6 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   .
   # CHF: currently seems euvolemic given relatively clear lungs, mild
   peripheral edema, elevated JVP but significant TR on previous TR.
   -maintain euvolemia as long as BP is okay
   -TTE as above
   .
   # CAD: No history of recent stents in our system but on aspirin and
   plavix for 3VD.
   -will rule out for MI, first set of enzymes slightly elevated troponin
   in acute setting.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: no bleeding, INR 5.6, likely secondary to coumadin,
   recent dose increase and also possibly lack of nutrtition lately.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now given mental status
   .
   # Access  L IJ central Line and 1xPIV
   .
   # PPx:  supratherapeutic on coumadin currently, no evidence of
   bleeding.
   .
   # Code:  unable to assess
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease. She was found unresponsive by her husband and has been lethargic for at least 10 days. She also has a history of profound hypothyroidism and Alzheimer's dementia with fluctuating mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 137/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has a central venous pressure of 14 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels and renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.0. The patient is being treated for potential infections, including meningitis, and has received ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin. The patient also has elevated liver function tests and macrocytic anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lactic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which may indicate lactic acidosis. This can be caused by hypoperfusion, sepsis, or other conditions that lead to poor tissue oxygenation.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease"

   # MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: Patient found hypoglycemic with unknown
   etiology. Also fever in ER and hypothermia in ICU with increase WBC.
   Patient MS now at her baseline. THS better than before at 36. Did not
   respond to narcan, serum tox negative, u tox pending. Most likely
   ideology is meningitis; however cannot do LP with high INR and she has
   already gotten antibiotics. No changes in personality and now
   improving, so not likely to be HSV. Rapid improvement for viral.
   -          Continue Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Ampicilin Day [**2-13**] for meningitis
   (empiric treatment)
   -          If patient not improving then LP correcting rapidly with FFP
   and vitamin K
   -          Follow up urine tox
   -          Follow renal recs to improve possible contribution of uremia
   -          Monitor glucose
   -          Monitor hemodynamics
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Most likely in the setting of fasting, being down
   and with low sugar and infection. Hemodinamics and vital signs do not
   suggest infection. Awaiting culture data. No data to support
   cardiogenic shock with tissue ischemia or abdominal pain and mesenteric
   ischemia. Lactate 3.3.
   - continue to trend lactate
   - treat infectious causes as above.
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; UA with
   proteinuria and trace keytones. Patient on diuretics before admission,
   so FeUrea more accurate and pointing to pre-renal. There were no castas
   in the urine to suggest ATN.
   .
   # FEVER: u/a negative, blood cultures sent.  CXR and non contrast CT
   abdomen / pelvis.  F/u blood cultures.
   -given mental status changes and inability to do an LP would feel
   compelled to treat for meningitis.  She has been given Ceftriaxone and
   vancomycin in the ED at meningitis doses and we will add ampicillin as
   well.  No other clear source for infection however given elevated
   lactate.  Given no clear GI source will d/c flagyl.
   -continue to monitor fever curve
   -has gotten 3L fluid to decrease lactate but never was hypotensive, has
   an EF of 20%, will hold off on additional fluids
   -vancomycin level low, so dose today
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly from hypotension given elevated lactate,
   although never recorded hypotension.  Continue to trend.  RUQ
   ultrasound normal.
   -obtain abd ultrasound with doppler
   -given hep C, acute viral hepatitis is a possibility, not in acute
   phase of hep C but could be superimposed hep A or hep B, send hep A IgG
   and IgM and Hep B antibody panel.
   -tylenol level not elevated
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: send B12, and folate but could also be
   hypothyroidism.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: not eating lately and previously had been on insulin.
   Will continue to monitor for hypoglycemia but unclear why she had a
   finger stick glucose of 20.  It is possible that this was erroneous as
   she is not on any glucose lowering medications and the glucose levels
   below 70 or so are not very accurate on finger stick glucometers.
   -continue to monitor, if hypoglycemic will send a serum glucose,
   insulin level and C peptide level
   -q6 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   .
   # CHF: currently seems euvolemic given relatively clear lungs, mild
   peripheral edema, elevated JVP but significant TR on previous TR.
   -maintain euvolemia as long as BP is okay
   -TTE as above
   .
   # CAD: No history of recent stents in our system but on aspirin and
   plavix for 3VD.
   -will rule out for MI, first set of enzymes slightly elevated troponin
   in acute setting.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: no bleeding, INR 5.6, likely secondary to coumadin,
   recent dose increase and also possibly lack of nutrtition lately.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now given mental status
   .
   # Access  L IJ central Line and 1xPIV

   her MS [**Last Name (Titles) 3333**]
t improve as fast as one would expect with glucose and
   narcan however. Also with increase WBC. Concern is for meningitis vs.
   stroke. LP could not be performed given her elevated INR on
   presentation and MRI also cannot be done d/t renal failure (CT head
   negative). Uremia could also be partial cause of her MS changes. Once
   these levels get within reasonable ranges would do both to evaluate for

   severe left ventricular hypokinesis and right sided severe global free
   wall hypokinesis, which could account for poor delivery and ischemia,
   leading to elevated lactate levels. Trending down since admission, will
   continue to monitor.
   - continue to trend lactate

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was found unresponsive by her husband and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's mental status changes have improved since receiving glucose and narcan, but her WBC count is elevated, raising concerns for meningitis versus stroke. A lumbar puncture (LP) could not be performed due to an elevated INR, and an MRI cannot be done due to renal failure (CT head negative). Uremia could also be a partial cause of her mental status changes. Once the patient's INR levels decrease, an LP will be performed to evaluate for central nervous system (CNS) pathology. Urine tox is negative. The patient has received antibiotics in the emergency department, which should be continued. The antibiotics include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin for meningitis (empiric treatment).

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 70 yoF w/ a h/o CHF EF 20%, DMII, CAD , PVD, HTN, COPD, and
   CKD w/ a baseline Cr of 2.0 found unresponsive by her husband.
   [**Name (NI) 440**]:
   .
   # MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: Patient found unresponsive without clear
   etiology. Hypoglycemic, febrile on presentation, also given narcan; her
   MS [**Last Name (Titles) 3333**]
t improve as fast as one would expect with glucose and narcan
   if those were primary problem. Also with increase WBC. Concern is for
   meningitis vs. stroke. LP could not be performed given her elevated INR
   on presentation and MRI also cannot be done d/t renal failure (CT head
   negative). Uremia, toxic metabolic etiology could also be cause of her
   MS changes. Once these levels get within reasonable ranges would do
   both to evaluate for CNS pathology. Urine tox is negative. Received
   antibiotics in ED which should be continued. Patient MS now at her
   baseline per husband and significantly improved. Continue
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Ampicilin Day [**4-14**] for meningitis (empiric treatment).
   Of note, recent CXR with left lung opacity, atelectasis which could
   indicated aspiration however this may have been secondary to her
   unresponsive episode and not a cause for it. Her hypoglycemia as well
   could be in response to a metabolic/infectious process and not the
   primary insult.
   - Review patient medications with husband to evaluate whether she has
   been getting hyperglycemic medications at home inappropriately
   -          Monitor INR, would get LP once its wnl
   -          MRI once creatinine improved
   -          Monitor glucose
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Initial concern was lactate elevated d/t being down,
   poor PO. Initially low suspicion of infection, however blood and urine
   cultures still pending. Another issue is cardiogenic failure- she has
   severe left ventricular hypokinesis and right sided severe global free
   wall hypokinesis, which could account for poor delivery and ischemia,
   leading to elevated lactate levels. Trending down since admission, will
   continue to monitor. Also? any medications she is taking that could
   exacerbate an already cirrhotic/damaged liver d/t hepatitis C.
   - continue to trend lactate
   - treat infectious causes as above
   -IV fluids for maintenance of perfusion
   -lactulose for BM
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; UA with
   proteinuria and trace keytones. No casts on urine.  Likely secondary to
   poor delivery/hypotension while being found down.
   -continue to trend Cr
   -IVF as needed
   -avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   .
   # FEVER: Currently urine is negative, toxicology negative and blood
   cultures pending. CXR and CT ab/pel without indication of infectious
   etiology. She is currently being treated for meningitis given inability
   to do LP, MRI. Continue current antibiotics, not on antiviral for HSV
   however since her MS has improved or hasn
t gotten worse this would be
   an unlikely presentation.
   -would benefit from LP when INR appropriate
   - continue Ceftriaxone and vancomycin, ampicillin
   -continue to monitor fever curve for hypothermia
   -trend WBC
   -f/u CXR for resolution of atelectasis, opacity
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Patient with known hepatitis C. Possibly also from
   hypotension although no record of hypotension since admission. RUQ
   ultrasound normal and CT without indication of intraabdominal abscess,
   infectious source. Continue to be elevated with increasing Tbili.
   Hepatitis panel negative and toxicology negative.
   -f/u pending labs
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -avoid hepatotoxic meds
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: B12, folate appear to be elevated. TSH improved
   since last clinic note.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Not clear as to why patient is persistently
   hypoglycemic. Possibly due to infection or inappropriate administration
   of medications at home.
   -q2 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   -consider D51/2NS for fluids
   .
   # CHF: currently seems euvolemic given relatively clear lungs, mild
   peripheral edema, elevated JVP but significant TR on previous TR.
   Significant cardiac disease on echo. Monitor for fluid overload.
   .
   # CAD: No history of recent stents in our system but on aspirin and
   plavix for 3VD.
   -will rule out for MI, first set of enzymes slightly elevated troponin
   in acute setting.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: With elevated INR but no evidence of bleed. Could be
   secondary to hepatic insufficiency.
   -trend INR
   -hold coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) found unresponsive by her husband.
- The patient presented with hypoglycemia, fever, and altered mental status (AMS), which initially raised concerns for meningitis or stroke. However, the AMS has now improved to baseline levels.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. Empiric antibiotics have been initiated for suspected meningitis.
- The patient's chest X-ray showed left lung opacity and atelectasis, which could indicate aspiration, but it may be secondary to the unresponsive episode.
- The patient's lactic acidosis is trending down since admission and could be due to poor delivery and ischemia secondary to cardiogenic failure.
- The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 19.1% and creatinine of 3.7, likely secondary to poor delivery/hypotension while being found unresponsive.
- The patient's fever is currently negative for infection in the urine and toxicology screens, with blood cultures pending. Treatment for meningitis is being continued,"

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was found unresponsive by her husband and had hypoglycemia and hypothermia on presentation. Narcan was given, but there was no improvement. Her mental status (MS) has improved significantly, and she is now at her baseline level according to her husband.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Mental Status Changes: The patient was found unresponsive without a clear etiology. Hypoglycemic and hypothermic on presentation, and given narcan; however, her MS did not improve as fast as expected with glucose and narcan. An increase in white blood cell count is noted, raising concerns for meningitis versus stroke. Lumbar puncture (LP) could not be performed due to elevated INR on presentation, and MRI cannot be done due to renal failure (CT head negative).

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old female admitted with MS changes
   Previously, had shown  slow improvement on empiric mengitis treatment
   to near-baseline, however,  MS appears worse today
   It is presumed an infectious insult caused her to worsen initially,
   less clear as to why MS is worse today. Continues to have episodic
   hypoglycyemia, of concern given mild transaminitis and +Hep C.
   Mental status changes
   *Hold on floor transfer given decreased MS this morning
   *Continue current abx and pan-culture
   *Despite ffp, INR remains high- not yet able to get LP
   *Consider MRI if not improved
   *Review of recent [**9-8**] GI note suggests she was supposed to be on
   lactulose/rifaximin suggesting there could be a contribution from
   hepatic encephalopathy. Will check ammonia level and may need lactulose
   though given her current MS this would likely need to be administered
   via NG
   Hypoglycemia:
   *Some recent reports that the patient may still be on glipizide and
   metformin (though not part of her OMR profile) and if so, this could
   explain why her hypoglycemia has been slow to resolve.  Decreased drug
   clearance
 she has both hepatic and renal insufficiency-- and
   underlying liver disease could contribute.
   *Frequent accuchecks/add dextrose to IVF's
   Acute on chronic renal failure: slight decrease in Cr, reasonable uop.

   Afternoon addendum: Pt has remained more confused than usual throughout
   the day, though minimally changed from this morning. She continues to
   have hypoglycemia: despite addition of to IVF, her  BG
s still
   sporadically drop and have accordingly increased accu check frequency
   to q2 hours. We discussed obtaining brain MRI, but are reluctant to
   administer sedating meds to get this done- will hold off tonight and
   reassess tomorrow am.
   Pt remains critically ill.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hepatitis C (Hep C). She was found unresponsive and admitted with fevers and hypoglycemia. She has received antibiotics for presumed meningitis but was unable to undergo lumbar puncture due to supratherapeutic INR on admission.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 164/107 to 172/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings of 53 mg/dL and 74 mg/dL. Her labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals dilated pupils, normal heart sounds without murmurs, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and normal muscle strength. Neurologically, she is non-attentive, follows simple commands, responds to tactile stimuli, and shows non-purposeful movement"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of CHF, DM2, PVD, HTN, COPD, CRI, and DVT. She was found unresponsive and admitted with fevers and hypoglycemia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for presumed meningitis but was unable to undergo lumbar puncture due to a supratherapeutic INR on admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 70 to 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121 to 172 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently not on respiratory support.

Her physical examination reveals no acute distress, dilated pupils, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and normal peripheral pulses. Neurological examination shows that the patient is non-purposeful, responds to tactile stimuli, and has normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, low glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals no stones or abnormalities in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.

The assessment and plan indicate worsening of the patient's MS (multiple sclerosis) changes despite improvement on empiric meningitis treatment. The cause for worsening is unclear. The plan is to continue current antibiotics, obtain"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient was found unresponsive and admitted with fevers and hypoglycemia. She has received antibiotics for presumed meningitis but could not undergo lumbar puncture due to a supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) on admission.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Percocet (oral), codeine, and unknown medications. Her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on September 25th, ceftriaxone on September 26th, and ampicillin on September 27th. She is currently receiving dextrose 50% in her IV fluids and other medications including Synthroid, Plavix, Lopressor, and isosorbide. The patient's microvascular dementia/Alzheimer's changes are also noted.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: the patient has fevers, hypoglycemia, and her MS changes are worse today.

The vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/107 to 172/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a low of 38 mg/dL and a high of 74 mg/dL.

The physical examination reveals dilated pupils, no endotracheal tube, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and normal muscle tone. Neurologic examination shows no attentive or follow-up commands, responds to tactile stimuli, non-purposeful movement, not sedated or paralyzed, and normal muscle tone.

The laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate acid levels, increased liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes show low potassium (K+), low calcium (Ca++), and low magnesium (Mg++). The imaging shows no stones or liver abnormalities on the right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's MS changes have worsened despite near-baseline improvement on empiric meningitis treatment. The patient continues to have episodic hypoglycemia, mild transaminitis, and positive Hepatitis C status. The plan includes continuing current antibiotics, obtaining panculture,"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 year old female admitted with MS changes
   Previously, had shown  slow improvement on empiric mengitis treatment
   to near-baseline, however,  MS appears worse today
   It is presumed an infectious insult caused her to worsen initially,
   less clear as to why MS is worse today. Continues to have episodic
   hypoglycyemia, of concern given mild transaminitis and +Hep C.
   Mental status changes
   *Hold on floor transfer given decreased MS this morning
   *Continue current abx and pan-culture
   *Despite ffp, INR remains high- not yet able to get LP
   *Consider MRI if not improved
   *Review of recent [**9-8**] GI note suggests she was supposed to be on
   lactulose/rifaximin suggesting there could be a contribution from
   hepatic encephalopathy. Will check ammonia level and may need lactulose
   though given her current MS this would likely need to be administered
   via NG
   Hypoglycemia:
   *Some recent reports that the patient may still be on glipizide and
   metformin (though not part of her OMR profile) and if so, this could
   explain why her hypoglycemia has been slow to resolve.  Decreased drug
   clearance
 she has both hepatic and renal insufficiency-- and
   underlying liver disease could contribute.
   *Frequent accuchecks/add dextrose to IVF's
   Acute on chronic renal failure: slight decrease in Cr, reasonable uop.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hepatitis C (Hep C). She was found unresponsive with fevers and hypoglycemia, leading to admission. She has received antibiotics for presumed meningitis but could not undergo lumbar puncture due to a therapeutic INR. 

The patient's medical history includes microvascular dementia/?Alzheimer's. She has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications, including Synthroid, Plavix, [Last Name (un) 2299], lopressor, and isosorbide.

On examination, her vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/107 to 172/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is in sinus rhythm and has a normal heart and lung examination. 

Her neurological examination reveals dilated pupils, no focal deficits, and no signs of paralysis or sedation. Her mental status is described as nonattentive, with no follow-up commands, but she responds to tactile"

   # Mental Status Changes: Patient was found to be much more responsive
   today during rounds, asking for water and shaking head yes/no to
   questions which is new for her on this admission. At this point her
   work-up largely points to a toxic-metabolic etiology for her MS
   changes. What is unclear is why she is actually more interactive today
   while her liver panel tests have almost doubled and worsened. MRI was
   attempted yesterday but she cannot tolerate contrast d/t CRF and will
   likely not be compliant with the exam unless sedated. EEG was also
   discussed however given today
s labs it is clear that hepatic failure
   is the likely cause. Since meningitis is much less likely at this
   point, would not pursue LP nor continue empiric treatment for
   meningitis. I would however cover for SBP which she is at risk for.
   -          Give lactulose
   -          Cover possible GI infectious source w/ceftriaxone, flagyl
   -          Follow fever curve
   # Transaminitis: Patient with known hepatitis C and today with
   significantly elevated LFTs, bilirubin. This is likely the etiology of
   her mental status changes and potentially the cause of her recent
   hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and perhaps thrombocytopenia. Patient has
   known severe LV hypokinesis and R sided free wall hypokinesis, consider
   hepatic congestion, thrombosis. Would repeat US with doppler to further
   evaluate hepatobiliary vasculature and flow, cover for SBP with
   ceftriaxone and flagyl, continue lactulose and consult liver service.
   -consult liver service
   -continue lactulose
   -RUQ US w/doppler
   -cover for SBP
   -avoid hepatotoxic meds- hold tylenol unless fever greater than 101.9
   -trend LFTs, LA, bili, ammonia levels
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; Cr 3.6 and
   1L.  Likely secondary to poor delivery/hypotension while being found
   down. However creatinine has not improved despite fluid rescucitation.
   Consider spinning urine, microscopic eval for casts, or consult renal
   service. Although at this point unlikely consider hepatorenal syndrome.
   -continue to trend Cr
   -IVF as needed
   -avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   .
   # FEVER:. Consider GI etiology. Will d/c vanco and ampicillin and
   continue ceftriaxone and flagyl.
   -

   # Macrocytic Anemia: B12, folate appear to be elevated. TSH improved
   since last clinic note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was found unresponsive. The patient has shown some improvement in responsiveness today but still does not get out of bed. 

The assessment includes mental status changes, transaminitis, acute-on-chronic renal failure, fever, macrocytic anemia, hypoglycemia, CHF/CAD, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, and femoral nerve palsy. 

The plan includes covering for possible gastrointestinal infectious source with ceftriaxone and flagyl, following the fever curve, repeating an ultrasound with Doppler to evaluate hepatobiliary vasculature and flow, consulting liver service, continuing lactulose, avoiding hepatotoxic medications, holding tylenol unless fever is greater than 101.9, trending liver function tests (LFTs), lactic acid levels, bilirubin, and ammonia levels. 

The patient also requires continued monitoring of creatinine levels, intravenous fluid resuscitation as needed, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and renal dosing of all medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 70 yoF w/ a h/o CHF EF 20%, DMII, CAD , PVD, HTN, COPD, and
   CKD w/ a baseline Cr of 2.0 found unresponsive by her husband.
   [**Name (NI) 440**]:
   .
   # MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: Patient found unresponsive without clear
   etiology. Hypoglycemic, febrile on presentation, with increase WBC.
   Concern is for meningitis vs. stroke. LP could not be performed given
   her elevated INR on presentation and MRI also cannot be done d/t renal
   failure (CT head negative) and her inability to cooperate with exam.
   Uremia, toxic metabolic etiology could also be cause of her MS changes.
   Per husband her mental status is slighly worse than baseline. She is
   usually nonverbal but will respond to him at times.  An MRI at this
   point and/or EEG would be helpful in determining if she has a
   toxic-metabolic picture given her rising liver panel. Continue
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Ampicilin Day [**4-14**] for meningitis (empiric treatment).
   Also consider adding on additional GNR/anaerobic coverage for GI
   source.
   - Neuro consult and EEG
   -          Consider MRI if patient can tolerate
   -          Continue to monitor glucose
   -          Follow fever curve
   -          Continue lactulose
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Initial concern was lactate elevated d/t being down,
   poor PO. Also concern for infection given fever- Patient has known
   hepatitis. Another issue is cardiogenic failure- she has severe left
   ventricular hypokinesis and right sided severe global free wall
   hypokinesis, which could account for poor delivery and ischemia,
   leading to elevated lactate levels. Trending down since admission, will
   continue to monitor. Ammonia levels wnl.
   - continue to trend lactate
   - treat infectious causes as above
   -IV fluids for maintenance of perfusion
   -lactulose for BM
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; UA with
   proteinuria and trace keytones. No casts on urine.  Likely secondary to
   poor delivery/hypotension while being found down.
   -continue to trend Cr
   -IVF as needed
   -avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   .
   # FEVER:. CXR and CT ab/pel without indication of infectious etiology.
   She is currently being treated for meningitis given inability to do LP,
   MRI. With her increasing LFTs this may indicate a GI source. Continue
   current antibiotics.
   -would benefit from LP when INR appropriate
   - continue Ceftriaxone and vancomycin, ampicillin
   -continue to monitor fever curve for hypothermia
   -trend WBC
   -f/u CXR for resolution of atelectasis, opacity
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Patient with known hepatitis C. Possibly also from
   hypotension although no record of hypotension since admission. RUQ
   ultrasound normal and CT without indication of intraabdominal abscess,
   infectious source. Continue to be elevated with increasing Tbili.
   Hepatitis panel negative and toxicology negative.
   -f/u pending labs
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -avoid hepatotoxic meds
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: B12, folate appear to be elevated. TSH improved
   since last clinic note.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Not clear as to why patient is persistently
   hypoglycemic. Possibly due to infection or inappropriate administration
   of medications at home.
   -q2 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   -switch to NS as sugars increased
   .
   # CHF: currently seems euvolemic given relatively clear lungs, mild
   peripheral edema, elevated JVP but significant TR on previous TR.
   Significant cardiac disease on echo. Monitor for fluid overload.
   .
   # CAD: No history of recent stents in our system but on aspirin and
   plavix for 3VD.
   -will rule out for MI, first set of enzymes slightly elevated troponin
   in acute setting.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: With elevated INR but no evidence of bleed. Could be
   secondary to hepatic insufficiency.  Labs likely erroneous this
   morning.
   -trend INR
   -hold coumadin
   .
   # FEN:  NS IVF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Access  L IJ central Line and 1xPIV
   .
   # PPx:  supratherapeutic on coumadin currently, no evidence of
   bleeding.

   # MENTAL STATUS CHANGES: Patient found unresponsive without clear

   MS [**Last Name (Titles) 3333**]
t improve as fast as one would expect with glucose and narcan
   if those were primary problem. Also with increase WBC. Concern is for
   meningitis vs. stroke. LP could not be performed given her elevated INR
   on presentation and MRI also cannot be done d/t renal failure (CT head
   negative). Uremia, toxic metabolic etiology could also be cause of her
   MS changes. Once these levels get within reasonable ranges would do
   both to evaluate for CNS pathology. Urine tox is negative. Received
   antibiotics in ED which should be continued. Patient MS now at her
   baseline per husband and significantly improved. Continue
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone/Ampicilin Day [**4-14**] for meningitis (empiric treatment).
   Of note, recent CXR with left lung opacity, atelectasis which could
   indicated aspiration however this may have been secondary to her
   unresponsive episode and not a cause for it. Her hypoglycemia as well
   could be in response to a metabolic/infectious process and not the
   primary insult.
   - Review patient medications with husband to evaluate whether she has
   been getting hyperglycemic medications at home inappropriately
   -          Monitor INR, would get LP once its wnl
   -          MRI once creatinine improved
   -          Monitor glucose
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Initial concern was lactate elevated d/t being down,
   poor PO. Initially low suspicion of infection, however blood and urine
   cultures still pending. Another issue is cardiogenic failure- she has
   severe left ventricular hypokinesis and right sided severe global free
   wall hypokinesis, which could account for poor delivery and ischemia,
   leading to elevated lactate levels. Trending down since admission, will
   continue to monitor. Also? any medications she is taking that could
   exacerbate an already cirrhotic/damaged liver d/t hepatitis C.
   - continue to trend lactate
   - treat infectious causes as above
   -IV fluids for maintenance of perfusion
   -lactulose for BM
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; UA with
   proteinuria and trace keytones. No casts on urine.  Likely secondary to
   poor delivery/hypotension while being found down.
   -continue to trend Cr
   -IVF as needed
   -avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   .
   # FEVER: Currently urine is negative, toxicology negative and blood
   cultures pending. CXR and CT ab/pel without indication of infectious
   etiology. She is currently being treated for meningitis given inability
   to do LP, MRI. Continue current antibiotics, not on antiviral for HSV
   however since her MS has improved or hasn
t gotten worse this would be
   an unlikely presentation.
   -would benefit from LP when INR appropriate
   - continue Ceftriaxone and vancomycin, ampicillin
   -continue to monitor fever curve for hypothermia
   -trend WBC
   -f/u CXR for resolution of atelectasis, opacity
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Patient with known hepatitis C. Possibly also from
   hypotension although no record of hypotension since admission. RUQ
   ultrasound normal and CT without indication of intraabdominal abscess,
   infectious source. Continue to be elevated with increasing Tbili.
   Hepatitis panel negative and toxicology negative.
   -f/u pending labs
   -continue to trend enzymes
   -avoid hepatotoxic meds
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: B12, folate appear to be elevated. TSH improved
   since last clinic note.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Not clear as to why patient is persistently
   hypoglycemic. Possibly due to infection or inappropriate administration
   of medications at home.
   -q2 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   -consider D51/2NS for fluids
   .
   # CHF: currently seems euvolemic given relatively clear lungs, mild
   peripheral edema, elevated JVP but significant TR on previous TR.
   Significant cardiac disease on echo. Monitor for fluid overload.
   .
   # CAD: No history of recent stents in our system but on aspirin and
   plavix for 3VD.
   -will rule out for MI, first set of enzymes slightly elevated troponin
   in acute setting.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: With elevated INR but no evidence of bleed. Could be
   secondary to hepatic insufficiency.
   -trend INR
   -hold coumadin
   .
   # FEN:  NS IVF, replete electrolytes
   .
   # Access  L IJ central Line and 1xPIV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was found unresponsive by her husband and had a fever of 101.9°F. She was started on non-invasive ventilation and IV antibiotics due to suspected infection. Her mental status improved after administration of narcan and glucose. Blood cultures were obtained, and she was started on empiric treatment for meningitis with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin. The patient also has elevated lactic acid levels, acute-on-chronic renal failure, fever of unknown origin, elevated liver function tests, macrocytic anemia, hypoglycemia, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, coagulopathy, and femoral nerve palsy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis due to suspected central nervous system infection. Further diagnostic tests like lumbar puncture (LP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are pending once the INR normalizes and renal function improves.
2. Lactic Acidosis: Initial concern was elevated lactate levels due to poor oral intake and potential infection. However, it could also be secondary to cardiogenic failure, which is evident from the severe left ventricular hypokinesis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and hepatitis C. She was admitted with worsening mental status and fevers, and was empirically treated for meningitis. Her hospital course has been notable for fluctuating mental status, persistent hypoglycemia, worsening coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and worsening liver function tests. 

The patient's current condition is concerning for hepatic failure, as evidenced by encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver function tests. The plan includes starting lactulose for encephalopathy, consulting a liver specialist, conducting an abdominal ultrasound and doppler study, changing antibiotics to provide more enteric coverage, checking hemolysis labs, and continuing frequent blood glucose monitoring due to recent discontinuation of dextrose infusion.

The patient also has a coagulopathy, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The plan includes administering vitamin K, checking DIC labs, checking for schistocytes on blood smear, and consulting a hematologist for possible TTP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hepatitis C (HepC). The patient was admitted with worsening mental status and fevers. The notable events since admission include persistent hypoglycemia, worsening coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and worsening liver function tests.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.8°C (101.9°F)
- Heart rate: 71 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 64-101 bpm
- Blood pressure: 168/110 mmHg with a range of 123-170/68-120 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute with a range of 13-28 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination findings include reactive and symmetric pupils, clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart rhythm without murmurs or gallops, soft abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and no central nervous system deficits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease. She was found unresponsive by her husband and had a baseline creatinine level of 2.0. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including mental status changes, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal failure, hypoglycemia, congestive heart failure, and coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a potential complication of liver dysfunction.
2. Hepatitis C infection: The patient has known hepatitis C, which could be causing her transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes) and potentially contributing to her mental status changes, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia.
3. Hepatic congestion: Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure, there is a possibility of hepatic congestion contributing to her liver pathology.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute worsening of her chronic kidney disease, possibly secondary to poor delivery/hypotension.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Fulminant hepatitis: The patient has been experiencing liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The stoppage of ceftriaxone and unnecessary medications is recommended to prevent further liver damage.

2. Hepatic congestion: The presence of to-and-fro flow within the main portal vein may indicate underlying hepatic congestion or an underlying primary hepatic process.

3. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient has a coagulopathy with low fibrinogen levels and thrombocytopenia. DIC is a possible complication due to sepsis or severe liver disease.

4. Hemolysis: The patient's low haptoglobin level and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) suggest the possibility of hemolysis.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced hypoglycemic episodes, likely secondary to hepatic failure.

6. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, possibly due to poor delivery/hypotension.

7. Thrombosis: The patient's known severe left ventricular (LV) hypokinesis and right-sided free wall hypokinesis raise concerns about hepatic congestion or thrombosis.

8. Hepatitis E infection: The patient's known"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with unknown allergies, who was admitted to the ICU due to fulminant hepatitis. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are significantly elevated, indicating liver damage. The abdominal ultrasound showed good portal flow, patent hepatic veins, and IVC, but there may be underlying hepatic congestion or a primary hepatic process. The patient has a history of fever and hypotension, and his vital signs are currently stable with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114-137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (ampicillin and ceftriaxone), which have been discontinued due to potential hepatotoxicity. Other medications include codeine and Percocet. The patient's labs indicate elevated liver enzymes, low fibrinogen levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's condition has improved, as he is more awake and conversant. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and history of fulminant hepatitis indicate ongoing liver damage, which can lead to hepatic failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Elevated D"

   # Mental Status Changes: Patient was found to be much more responsive
   today during rounds, asking for water and shaking head yes/no to
   questions which is new for her on this admission. At this point her
   work-up largely points to a toxic-metabolic etiology for her MS
   changes. What is unclear is why she is actually more interactive today
   while her liver panel tests have almost doubled and worsened. MRI was
   attempted yesterday but she cannot tolerate contrast d/t CRF and will
   likely not be compliant with the exam unless sedated. EEG was also
   discussed however given today
s labs it is clear that hepatic failure
   is the likely cause. Since meningitis is much less likely at this
   point, would not pursue LP nor continue empiric treatment for
   meningitis. I would however cover for SBP which she is at risk for.
   -          Give lactulose
   -          Cover possible GI infectious source w/ceftriaxone, flagyl
   -          Follow fever curve
   # Transaminitis: Patient with known hepatitis C and today with
   significantly elevated LFTs, bilirubin. This is likely the etiology of
   her mental status changes and potentially the cause of her recent
   hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and perhaps thrombocytopenia. Patient has
   known severe LV hypokinesis and R sided free wall hypokinesis, consider
   hepatic congestion, thrombosis. Would repeat US with doppler to further
   evaluate hepatobiliary vasculature and flow, cover for SBP with
   ceftriaxone and flagyl, continue lactulose and consult liver service.
   -consult liver service
   -continue lactulose
   -RUQ US w/doppler
   -cover for SBP
   -avoid hepatotoxic meds- hold tylenol unless fever greater than 101.9
   -trend LFTs, LA, bili, ammonia levels
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; Cr 3.6 and
   1L.  Likely secondary to poor delivery/hypotension while being found
   down. However creatinine has not improved despite fluid rescucitation.
   Consider spinning urine, microscopic eval for casts, or consult renal
   service. Although at this point unlikely consider hepatorenal syndrome.
   -continue to trend Cr
   -IVF as needed
   -avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   .
   # FEVER:. Consider GI etiology. Will d/c vanco and ampicillin and
   continue ceftriaxone and flagyl.
   -
   .
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: B12, folate appear to be elevated. TSH improved
   since last clinic note.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Not clear as to why patient is persistently
   hypoglycemic. Possibly due to infection or inappropriate administration
   of medications at home.
   -q2 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   -switch to NS as sugars increased
   .
   # CHF/CAD: Significant hypokinesis, TR may be playing a role in her
   liver pathology. Currently on beta blocker for hypertension and
   monitoring for fluid overload. Would benefit from CVP measurements.
   -check CVP
   -continue beta blocker
   -hold ASA, plavix
   .
   # Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: Hepatic insufficiency at this point is
   much more likely than HUS, TTP/ITP etc. Both could be attributed to
   hepatitis infection, however would continue to work up DIC labs and
   follow CBC.
   -1 dose IV vit K
   -hold all anticoagulation
   -PM chem, lytes, coags
   -f/u pending labs

- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was found unresponsive and is currently in the ICU.
- She has mental status changes, possibly due to toxic-metabolic etiology or hepatic failure.
- Her liver panel tests have worsened, indicating possible acute hepatitis.
- She is also experiencing transaminitis, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.
- She has a fever, and a possible gastrointestinal infectious source is being covered with antibiotics.
- She has macrocytic anemia, possibly related to her liver pathology.
- She has hypoglycemia, which could be due to infection or medication administration.
- She has CHF and CAD, with significant hypokinesis and tricuspid regurgitation.
- She has coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, likely due to hepatic insufficiency.
- She requires lactulose, coverage for possible gastrointestinal infectious source, and repeat US with doppler.
- She needs consultation with the liver service and avoidance of hepatotoxic medications.
- She also needs monitoring for SBP and trends in LFT"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 70 yoF w/ a h/o CHF EF 20%, DMII, CAD , PVD, HTN, COPD, and

   [**Name (NI) 440**]:
   .
   # Mental Status Changes: Patient was found to be much more responsive
   today during rounds,  Pt responded to lactulose and rifaxim.  At this
   point her work-up largely points to a toxic-metabolic etiology for her
   MS changes. What is unclear is why she is actually more interactive
   today while her liver panel tests have almost doubled and worsened. MRI
   was attempted yesterday but she cannot tolerate contrast d/t CRF and
   will likely not be compliant with the exam unless sedated. EEG was also
   discussed however given today
s labs it is clear that hepatic failure
   is the likely cause. Since meningitis is much less likely at this
   point, would not pursue LP nor continue empiric treatment for
   meningitis. I would however cover for SBP which she is at risk for.
   -          Give lactulose
   -          Cover possible GI infectious source w/ceftriaxone, flagyl
   -          Follow fever curve
   # Transaminitis: Patient with known hepatitis C and today with
   significantly elevated LFTs, bilirubin. This is likely the etiology of
   her mental status changes and potentially the cause of her recent
   hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and perhaps thrombocytopenia. Patient has
   known severe LV hypokinesis and R sided free wall hypokinesis, consider
   hepatic congestion, thrombosis. Would repeat US with doppler to further
   evaluate hepatobiliary vasculature and flow, cover for SBP with
   ceftriaxone and flagyl, continue lactulose and consult liver service.
   -consult liver service
   -continue lactulose
   -RUQ US w/doppler
   -cover for SBP
   -avoid hepatotoxic meds- hold tylenol unless fever greater than 101.9
   -trend LFTs, LA, bili, ammonia levels
   .
   # Acute on chornic renal failure: FeNA 1.8, FeUrea 19.1%; Cr 3.6 and
   1L.  Likely secondary to poor delivery/hypotension while being found
   down. However creatinine has not improved despite fluid rescucitation.
   Consider spinning urine, microscopic eval for casts, or consult renal
   service. Although at this point unlikely consider hepatorenal syndrome.
   -continue to trend Cr
   -IVF as needed
   -avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose all meds
   .
   # FEVER:. Consider GI etiology. Will d/c vanco and ampicillin and
   continue ceftriaxone and flagyl.
   -
   .
   .
   # Macrocytic Anemia: B12, folate appear to be elevated. TSH improved
   since last clinic note.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Not clear as to why patient is persistently
   hypoglycemic. Possibly due to infection or inappropriate administration
   of medications at home.
   -q2 finger sticks
   -possibly related to infection
   -switch to NS as sugars increased
   .
   # CHF/CAD: Significant hypokinesis, TR may be playing a role in her
   liver pathology. Currently on beta blocker for hypertension and
   monitoring for fluid overload. Would benefit from CVP measurements.
   -check CVP
   -continue beta blocker
   -hold ASA, plavix
   .
   # Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: Hepatic insufficiency at this point is
   much more likely than HUS, TTP/ITP etc. Both could be attributed to
   hepatitis infection, however would continue to work up DIC labs and
   follow CBC.
   -1 dose IV vit K
   -hold all anticoagulation
   -PM chem, lytes, coags
   -f/u pending labs
   .
   # FEN:  NS IVF, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow eval.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) ejection fraction of 20%, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) found unresponsive by her husband. The patient's mental status has improved since yesterday, and she is more interactive today. Her liver function tests (LFTs) have almost doubled and worsened. The patient has known hepatitis C and severe LV hypokinesis with right-sided free wall hypokinesis, suggesting possible hepatic congestion or thrombosis. An ultrasound (US) with Doppler is planned to evaluate hepatobiliary vasculature and flow. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Toxic-metabolic etiology for mental status changes
2. Hepatic failure causing mental status changes and potential hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia
3. Hepatic congestion or thrombosis due to severe LV hypokinesis and right-sided free wall hypokinesis
4. Acute on chronic renal failure with elevated creatinine levels
5. Hypoglycemia possibly due to infection or inappropriate administration of medications

   Mental status has improved coincident with treatment for hepatic
   encephalopathy. Story remains unclear, however.  Not previously known
   to have cirrhosis and echo is relatively unremarkable. Coags hard to
   interpret with coumadin rx and her recent bump in LFTs may be passive
   congestion.  regardless, she is gradually improving so will continue
   lactulose.   Creat remains elevated with UA suggseting ATn, also c/w
   some recent episode that might have induced hepatic inj.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a frail individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has altered mental status, fatigue, anemia, and dementia. They also have chronic viral hepatitis, chronic heart failure with systolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, cholesterol embolization, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and renal failure (both acute and chronic).

The patient's physical examination findings include a loud S2 heart sound, a systolic murmur, symmetric chest expansion, scattered basilar crackles, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and muscle wasting with inability to stand. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin levels, deranged coagulation profile, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer. The patient's blood counts are relatively within normal limits, but there are signs of chronic kidney disease with elevated creatinine levels.

The plan includes continuing lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, holding systemic anticoagulation due to elevated coagulation profile, and managing glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are also in place.
