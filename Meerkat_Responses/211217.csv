   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation.
   1. Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely CHF exacerbation worsened
   with her afib with RVR.  Additional factors likely worsening this are
   obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary
   hypertension. Pulmonary embolism however is also high on the
   differential given her history of atrial fibrillation and DVT.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1-2L negative today with
   the consideration of a lasix gtt for closer monitoring
   - aim for improved rate control with the addition of a diltiazem drip
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%
   - if O2 does not improve with diuresis +/- steroids, would consider CTA
   to evaluate for PE
   2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened CHF.
   - continue prn diltiazem for rate control and consider diltiazem gtt if
   heart rate control continues to be difficult to control
   - patient not an anticoagulation candidate due to history of GI bleed
   3. COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - consider adding steroids and azithromycin if symptoms do not improve
   with diuresis
   - will discontinue theophylline for now due to concern for multiple
   drug interactions and increase nebulizer treatments
   4. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her hypotension is
   unclear, although likely related to her atrial fibrillation.
   - hold antihypertensive agents for now
   - will try rate control with diltiazem drip

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department with shortness of breath, likely related to a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient's shortness of breath is multifactorial and may be worsened by obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary embolism is also a possibility given her history of atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient has been diuresed and is aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters today. Oxygen therapy is being weaned as tolerated, with a target oxygen saturation of 92-94%. If the patient does not improve with diuresis and oxygen therapy, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be considered to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is contributing to her worsened CHF. Rate control is being attempted with intravenous diltiazem, and a diltiazem drip may be considered if heart rate control continues to be difficult.

The patient has a history of COPD and is on home oxygen therapy. Her COPD management regimen includes spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She was admitted from the ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, shortness of breath, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
- Heart rate: 121 bpm (109-128 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 95/51 mmHg (62/58-128/87 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (19-29 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

Physical examination findings include a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border and also at the apex. There are scattered crackles bilaterally throughout the lungs, and the patient has a supple neck with JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 166 K/uL, elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L, and elevated blood glucose level of 95 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath.
   .
   1. Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely CHF exacerbation and COPD
   exacerbation. Additional factors likely worsening this are her afib
   with RVR in addition to her chronic problems of obesity
   hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.
   Pulmonary embolism however is also high on the differential given her
   history of atrial fibrillation and DVT, although she does have multiple
   other etiologies of her SOB.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1-2L negative today
   - will start with lasix boluses and consider lasix drip if needed
   - if O2 requirement does not improvement with diuresis this evening,
   will consider starting steroids and azithromcyin for treatment of COPD
   exacerbation
   - 30mg diltiazem as needed for rate control if blood pressure
   tolerates; could consider diltiazem drip as well
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - if O2 does not improve with diuresis +/- steroids, would consider CTA
   to evaluate for CTA
   .
   2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate, and it is unclear if this is secondary
   to infection and/or CHF.
   - continue prn diltiazem for rate control
   - patient not an anticoagulation candidate due to history of GI bleed
   .
   3. COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2. Although she does
   have wheezing on exam, unclear precipitant for a COPD exacerbation.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - consider adding steroids and azithromycin if symptoms do not improve
   with diuresis
   .
   4. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her hypotension is
   unclear, although likely related to her atrial fibrillation.
   - hold antihypertensive agents for now
   - will try rate control with CCB prn
   .
   5. Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation

","Summary:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD.
- She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and is currently experiencing respiratory distress.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 95/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination findings include a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border, scattered wheezes and crackles bilaterally, and no evidence of chest wall deformities or femoral bruits.
- The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,

   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. Patient
s CHF will
   continue to be difficult to control with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She was admitted from the emergency department with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and chronic lung disease.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's shortness of breath is most likely related to a CHF exacerbation. Factors worsening this include obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. It will continue to be difficult to control with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and would benefit from TEE/cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has elevated heart rate contributing to worsened diastolic CHF. Rate control with diltiazem has improved HR, and plans are to convert to PO diltiazem 360mg daily. Aspirin will be continued for anticoagulation, and EGD on Monday will assess for evidence of active bleeding or ulcers before starting long-term anticoagulation.

3. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2. The current regimen of inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and theophylline will be continued"

   1. Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely CHF exacerbation worsened
   with her afib with RVR.  Additional factors likely worsening this are
   obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary
   hypertension. Pulmonary embolism however is also high on the
   differential given her history of atrial fibrillation and DVT.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1L negative today with
   lasix gtt for closer monitoring
   - aim for improved rate control with the addition of a diltiazem drip
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%, currently on
   4L but baseline 3L

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Her current conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, COPD exacerbation, hypertension, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and she has been producing green sputum, which could indicate a possible pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given her history of atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), there is a high suspicion for a PE. If her oxygenation does not improve with diuresis and steroids, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may be considered to evaluate for PE.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and high inspired oxygen requirement may indicate the development of ARDS.
4. Worsening CHF Exacerbation: Despite diuresis, the patient's symptoms have not improved significantly, suggesting that her CHF exacerbation may worsen.
5. DVT or PE: As mentioned earlier, the patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for developing another one, which could lead to a PE.
6. Hypotension: The patient is currently borderline hypotensive, and her blood pressure needs to be closely monitored to prevent further hypotension.
7. Medication Interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, and there is a concern for potential drug interactions, particularly with the discontinuation of theophylline.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, oxygenation, fluid balance, and cardiovascular function. Frequent reassessment of the patient's condition and prompt management of any complications are crucial in the ICU setting."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation.
   1. Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely CHF exacerbation worsened
   with her afib with RVR.  Additional factors likely worsening this are
   obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary
   hypertension. Pulmonary embolism however is also high on the
   differential given her history of atrial fibrillation and DVT. Given
   improvement in symptoms with diuresis and rate control, less likely PE.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1L negative today with
   lasix gtt for closer monitoring; decrease I/O goal if significant
   creatinine bump in pm (increased from 1 to 1.2 last 24 hours) or
   worsening alkalosis
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%, currently on
   4L but baseline 3L
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR improved with diltiazem gtt last 24
   hours
   - continue diltiazem for rate control and consider change to PO today
   - patient not an anticoagulation candidate due to history of GI bleed
   but will d/w GI; possible EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday
   -ECG this am
   3. COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - will discontinue theophylline for now due to concern for multiple
   drug interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer
   treatments
    4. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation. BP stable overnight. MAPs currently in 70s.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem, consider change to PO (on 180
   at home, likely needs increased dose)
   5. Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation
   6. Hyperglycemia: Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids. No h/o DM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath likely related to a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The differential diagnosis includes CHF exacerbation, obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's symptoms have improved with diuretics and rate control, suggesting that the shortness of breath is primarily due to CHF exacerbation worsened by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). The obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension are contributing factors.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening CHF exacerbation leading to respiratory distress, development of pulmonary embolism, further deterioration of lung function due to COPD exacerbation, and potential adverse effects of the medications such as hyperglycemia while on steroids.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable with ongoing management of her symptoms and underlying conditions. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent any potential complications."

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD and acute on chronic heart failure. The patient's current medications include Lasix, diltiazem, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/60 to 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient has impaired skin integrity and is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels. However, his sodium, potassium, and calcium levels are slightly elevated. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic respiratory acidosis indicates long-term respiratory issues, which could potentially lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and heart failure increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation.
   1. Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely CHF exacerbation worsened
   with her afib with RVR.  Additional factors likely worsening this are
   obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary
   hypertension. Pulmonary embolism however is also high on the
   differential given her history of atrial fibrillation and DVT. Given
   improvement in symptoms with diuresis and rate control, less likely PE.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1L negative today with
   lasix gtt for closer monitoring; decrease I/O goal if significant
   creatinine bump in pm
   - aim for improved rate control with the addition of a diltiazem drip
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%, currently on
   4L but baseline 3L
   - if O2 does not improve with diuresis +/- steroids, would consider CTA
   to evaluate for PE
   - continue steroid burst wioth azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened CHF. HR improved with diltiazem gtt
   - continue diltiazem for rate control and consider change to PO today
   - patient not an anticoagulation candidate due to history of GI bleed
   but will d/w GI; possible EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on monday
   3. COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - will discontinue theophylline for now due to concern for multiple
   drug interactions and increase nebulizer treatments
    4. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/bortderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation. BP stable overnight. MAPs currently in 70s.
   - hold antihypertensive agents for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem, consider change to PO
   5. Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to a CHF exacerbation. 

The patient's symptoms did not improve with diuretics and rate control, leading to the consideration of a pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the improvement in symptoms with diuretics and rate control suggests that PE is less likely. The plan is to continue with diuretics, aim for improved rate control, wean off oxygen as tolerated, and consider a CT angiogram (CTA) to evaluate for PE if there is no improvement with diuretics and steroids.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is contributing to her worsened CHF. The heart rate improved with diltiazem gtt, and the plan is to continue diltiazem for rate control and consider a change to oral medication today.

The patient has a history of COPD and is on home oxygen. The plan is to continue the home regimen of medications, continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve much with diuretics, and discontinue theophylline due to concerns about multiple drug interactions.

The patient's hypertension is stable overnight, and the plan is to hold antihypertensive agents for now, continue rate control with dilt"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. Patient
s CHF will
   continue to be difficult to control with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
   and would benefit from TEE / cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm.
   Patient will need to be anticoagulated to undergo TEE and
   cardioversion; however she has not been a candidate for anticoagulation
   in the past due to prior episodes of melena. She has not undergone EGD
   or colonoscopy in the past due to difficulty tolerating procedure in
   the setting of multiple pulmonary comorbidities and morbid obesity.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1.5-2L negative today with
   lasix gtt for closer monitoring; decrease I/O goal if significant
   creatinine bump in pm (increased from 1 to 1.2 last 24 hours) or
   worsening alkalosis
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue rate control with diltiazem and convert to long acting
   diltiazem 360
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%, currently on
   4L but baseline 3L
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR improved with diltiazem gtt last 24
   hours. She has not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due
   to previous GI bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate
   a colonoscopy or EGD in the past.
   - convert to PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily
   - continue aspirin for anticoagulation
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday to assess for evidence of
   active bleeding or ulcers
   - if no evidence of active bleeding, will plan to start anticoagulation
   both in preparation for possibleTEE / cardioversion as well as for
   long-term anticoagulation in the setting of afib
   - ECG this am
   COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments

   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation. BP stable overnight. MAPs currently in 70s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and chronic lung disease. The patient's symptoms did not improve with diuresis and she was started on a steroid burst and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has diastolic heart failure, which is acute on chronic. She is markedly volume overloaded and requires aggressive diuresis with IV Lasix to achieve an input/output balance of -2 L/24 hours.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB with RVR): The patient's heart rate is controlled with diltiazem, but she has not been a candidate for anticoagulation due to prior episodes of melena. She will be started on heparin today and may require cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's COPD symptoms did not improve with diuresis, so she was started on a steroid burst and azithromycin. She requires continued treatment with inhalers and may need to wean off supplemental oxygen.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation.
   1. Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnosis includes most likely CHF exacerbation worsened
   with her afib with RVR.  Additional factors likely worsening this are
   obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary
   hypertension. Pulmonary embolism however is also high on the
   differential given her history of atrial fibrillation and DVT. Given
   improvement in symptoms with diuresis and rate control, less likely PE.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1L negative today with
   lasix gtt for closer monitoring; decrease I/O goal if significant
   creatinine bump in pm (increased from 1 to 1.2 last 24 hours) or
   worsening alkalosis
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%, currently on
   4L but baseline 3L
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR improved with diltiazem gtt last 24
   hours
   - continue diltiazem for rate control and consider change to PO today
   - patient not an anticoagulation candidate due to history of GI bleed
   but will d/w GI; possible EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday
   -ECG this am
   3. COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - will discontinue theophylline for now due to concern for multiple
   drug interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer
   treatments
    4. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation. BP stable overnight. MAPs currently in 70s.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem, consider change to PO (on 180
   at home, likely needs increased dose)
   5. Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation
   6. Hyperglycemia: Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids. No h/o DM

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1.5-2L negative today with
   lasix gtt .  Add chlorthiazide as needed.
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR controlled fairly with PO dilt.  She has
   not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to previous GI
   bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate a colonoscopy
   or EGD in the past.
   - PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily
   - Heparin bridge to coumadin (start tomorrow)
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday to assess for evidence of
   active bleeding or ulcers
   - depending on GI w/u, possible TEE/CV if she has no active GIB
   COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments
   Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation
   Hyperglycemia:
   Patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes but has elevated blood
   sugars on steroids. Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and COPD exacerbation.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has shown improvement in her breathing, stating that it feels ""easier."" She remains on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Her vital signs have stabilized, with a heart rate ranging from 105 to 117 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 123/70 to 133/90 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation has improved to 89%.

The patient's cardiac status has been managed with diltiazem for rate control and heparin bridge to warfarin due to her history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She continues to receive diuretics for CHF exacerbation and steroids and azithromycin for COPD exacerbation.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated glucose levels, increased potassium, and decreased albumin levels. Her white blood cell count has decreased slightly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and recent exacerbation, she is at risk for further respiratory"

The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AF), COPD, and CHF. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

In the past 24 hours, the patient underwent several interventions. The patient's sputum culture was obtained, and a PICC line was started. The patient refused endoscopy, with the anesthesia team discussing the possibility of needing intubation if endoscopy is performed. The patient deferred on the decision for now.

The patient's medications were adjusted, including switching diltiazem from intravenous to oral administration due to a high heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Additionally, an extra 30mg of diltiazem was given orally overnight. The patient also received chlorothiazide 250mg once for improved diuresis.

The patient is still requiring increased oxygen support and continues to have an elevated heart rate."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old obese female admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. The patient has a history of refusing endoscopy and anesthesia, with the possibility of needing intubation if endoscopy is done. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 123/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient is still requiring increased oxygen due to the acute exacerbation of COPD.

The patient's physical examination shows an obese female in no acute distress, with oriented mental status and appropriate mood and affect. The patient's heart sounds are normal, with a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border and another systolic murmur at the apex. There are scattered crackles bibasilar and faint expiratory wheezes in the chest, but no chest wall deformities or accessory muscle use. The patient has trace edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 4.5, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, blood glucose of 126 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, and magnesium of 1.7 mg/dL. Other labs show elevated troponin levels, PT/PTT/INR, and low albumin levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFib)
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with acute exacerbation
3. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic
4. Impaired skin integrity

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: This can lead to respiratory failure, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia, and potentially the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial fibrillation: It can result in hemodynamic instability, thromboembolic events, and potential deterioration of cardiac function.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output.
4. Impaired skin integrity: This can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and compromised wound healing.
5. DVT prophylaxis: If not managed appropriately, the patient may develop deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: If not adequately managed, the patient may develop stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. VAP prophylaxis: Inadequate prophylaxis may result in ventilator-associated pneumonia, a common complication in ICU patients.
8. Glycemic control: Poor glycemic control can contribute to poor outcomes in critically ill patients.

The patient's medical progress indicates several potential complications that need to be closely monitored and managed in the ICU setting."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. Patient
s CHF will
   continue to be difficult to control with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
   and would benefit from TEE / cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm.
   Patient will need to be anticoagulated to undergo TEE and
   cardioversion; however she has not been a candidate for anticoagulation
   in the past due to prior episodes of melena. She has not undergone EGD
   or colonoscopy in the past due to difficulty tolerating procedure in
   the setting of multiple pulmonary comorbidities and morbid obesity.
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1.5-2L negative today with
   lasix gtt for closer monitoring; decrease I/O goal if significant
   creatinine bump in pm (increased from 1 to 1.2 last 24 hours) or
   worsening alkalosis
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue rate control with diltiazem and convert to long acting
   diltiazem 360
   - wean O2 as tolerated and would aim for O2 sat > 92-94%, currently on
   4L but baseline 3L
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR improved with diltiazem gtt last 24
   hours. She has not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due
   to previous GI bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate
   a colonoscopy or EGD in the past.
   - convert to PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily
   - continue aspirin for anticoagulation
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday to assess for evidence of
   active bleeding or ulcers
   - if no evidence of active bleeding, will plan to start anticoagulation
   both in preparation for possibleTEE / cardioversion as well as for
   long-term anticoagulation in the setting of afib
   - ECG this am
   COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments
   Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation. BP stable overnight. MAPs currently in 70s.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem and transition to diltiazem
   360mg daily
   Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation
   Hyperglycemia:
   Patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes but has elevated blood
   sugars on steroids. Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and COPD exacerbation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Shortness of breath: The etiology is most likely related to CHF exacerbation worsened by afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation. Additional factors contributing to the shortness of breath include obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's CHF is difficult to control due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and would benefit from transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm. However, the patient needs to be anticoagulated before undergoing these procedures, but she has not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to prior episodes of melena.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1.5-2L negative today with
   lasix gtt .  Add chlorthiazide as needed.
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR controlled fairly with PO dilt.  She has
   not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to previous GI
   bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate a colonoscopy
   or EGD in the past.
   - PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily
   - Heparin bridge to coumadin (start tomorrow)
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday to assess for evidence of
   active bleeding or ulcers
   - depending on GI w/u, possible TEE/CV if she has no active GIB
   COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments
   Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation
   Hyperglycemia:
   Patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes but has elevated blood
   sugars on steroids. Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency department with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and COPD exacerbation. The patient's shortness of breath is most likely due to CHF exacerbation worsened by afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation. Additional factors contributing to her symptoms include obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's shortness of breath is most likely due to CHF exacerbation. It is important to monitor her fluid balance, administer diuretics as needed, and continue with appropriate cardiac medications.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's elevated heart rate is contributing to worsened diastolic CHF. Heart rate control with PO diltiazem is currently being implemented, and plans are in place for a GI evaluation to assess for evidence of active bleeding or ulcers before initiating anticoagulation.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2. It is important to continue her home"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and chronic lung disease.

The patient's symptoms have improved compared to admission. She continues to diurese and aims for being 1.5-2L negative today with Lasix gtt. Chlorothiazide will be added as needed. Her electrolytes will be monitored regularly.

She is also on a steroid taper with azithromycin for COPD exacerbation. CPAP will be used at night, and ABG will be done as needed to assess acid-base status.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is being treated with PO diltiazem for rate control. Heparin will be bridged to coumadin, but reassessment will be done given the drop in HCT and transfusion requirement. A follow-up with GI regarding EGD is recommended, considering the likely active low-grade bleeding.

The patient's COPD will continue to be managed with her home regimen of Spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol, montelukast, theophylline, and [Doctor's Name]. Steroids and azithromycin will be continued since symptoms did not improve much with diuresis. Theophylline has been discontinued for now due to concerns about multiple drug interactions and increased use of xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments.

Her history of hypertension will be monitored, and antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) will be held for now. Rate control will be maintained with diltiazem.

Anemia and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) are also noted. The patient's HCT trended down to 23 on anticoagulation, so she received a transfusion of 1 unit overnight with a bump of 2 points post-transfusion. No frank melena or GIB was observed. Monitoring of HCT will be done every 8 hours, guaiac testing of stool will be performed, and iron supplementation will be continued. PIVs and PICC lines will remain active, and a type and crossmatch will be maintained.

Hyperglycemia will be closely monitored while the patient is on steroids.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive a low sodium diet, and glycemic control will be managed with HISS.

Lines include a 20-Gauge [date] at 9:00 AM. Prophylaxis for DVT will be done with heparin SC, and stress ulcer prophylaxis will be managed with a PPI. VAP prophylaxis is not indicated.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition will be to the ICU for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. Symtpoms much
   improved compared with admission
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1.5-2L negative today with
   lasix gtt .  Add chlorothiazide as needed.
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue steroid taper with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   - CPAP at night (unsure of settings at home)
   - ABG prn to assess acid base status
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR controlled fairly with PO dilt.  She has
   not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to previous GI
   bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate a colonoscopy
   or EGD in the past.
   - PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily for rate control
   - Heparin bridge to coumadin but will reassess given drop in HCT and
   transfusion requirement
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] given likelyu active low grade bleeding
   - depending on GI w/u, possible TEE/CV if she has no active GIB
   COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments
   Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   Anemia/history of GIB
   HCt trended down to 23 on anticoagulation so transfused 1 unit
   overnight with bump of 2 points post-transfusion. No frank melena or
   GIB. Pt denies BM since admission.
   - monitor HCT q8
   - guiaiac all stool
   - continue iron supplementation
   - maintain PIVs, PICC, active type and screen

   Patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes but has elevated blood
   sugars on steroids. Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and chronic lung disease.

Over the course of her stay in the ICU, the patient's symptoms have improved compared to admission. However, she continues to experience fatigue and shortness of breath. Her heart rate has been controlled fairly with PO diltiazem for rate control. She has not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.0 g/dL and a hematocrit (Hct) level of 23.5%. Her white blood cell (WBC) count is within normal range. Her blood glucose levels have been elevated, indicating possible hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's shortness of breath is most likely related to a CHF exacerbation worsened by afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring and diuresis are recommended to manage this condition.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and COPD exacerbation.

The patient's symptoms have improved compared to admission, but she continues to have a decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 23.5% despite diuresis and blood transfusion. Her fluid balance is positive, indicating ongoing fluid overload. She is receiving furosemide (Lasix) infusion and has a low urine output.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is within an acceptable range while on nasal cannula oxygen. Her respiratory rate (RR) is within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals signs consistent with heart failure, including a third heart sound (S3) and bilateral lower extremity edema. No chest wall deformities or abnormal breath sounds are noted. The patient has stasis dermatitis but no active ulcers or wounds.

Laboratory results show a decrease in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count, as well as elevated blood glucose levels. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, but her kidney function is slightly"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath: acute diastolic heart failure and COPD
   exacerbation
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. Symtpoms much
   improved compared with admission
   - continue to diurese her and aim 2L negative today with lasix gtt .
   Add chlorothiazide as needed.
   - continue steroid taper with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   - CPAP at night (unsure of settings at home)
   - ABG prn to assess acid base status
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR controlled fairly with PO dilt.  She has
   not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to previous GI
   bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate a colonoscopy
   or EGD in the past.
   - start digoxin for rate control since holding off on beta blockers
   secondary to reactive airway disease
   - PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily for rate control
   - Patient failed heparin trial [**3-7**] dropping hct. discontinue Heparin
   given drop in HCT
   - blood transfusion this AM
   - start heparin 325mg daily
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] given likely active low grade bleeding
   - depending on GI w/u, possible TEE/CV if she has no active GIB
   COPD EXacerbation
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments
   Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   Anemia/history of GIB
   HCt trended down to 23 on anticoagulation so transfused 1 unit
   overnight with bump of 2 points post-transfusion. No frank melena or
   GIB. Pt denies BM since admission.
   - blood transfusion this AM
   - monitor HCT q12
   - guiaiac all stool
   - continue iron supplementation
   - maintain PIVs, PICC, active type and screen, PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hyperglycemia:
   Patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes but has elevated blood
   sugars on steroids. Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and chronic lung disease.

The patient has been receiving diuretics and has shown improvement in her symptoms. Her atrial fibrillation is being managed with digoxin and diltiazem for rate control. Heparin therapy was initiated due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration, but it was discontinued after a blood transfusion. The patient's COPD exacerbation is being treated with her regular home regimen of medications, including steroids and azithromycin. Hypertension is currently being managed by holding antihypertensive agents. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and anemia, which is being monitored closely with frequent hemoglobin checks and stool guaiac testing. Close monitoring of blood sugars is necessary while the patient is on steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and low urine output suggest worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and continued diuretic therapy will be important to prevent further fluid accumulation.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (diastolic), impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD and acute on chronic heart failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation level of 89% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving diuretics and has undergone blood transfusion. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels and low albumin levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction and malnutrition. The patient's WBC count is within normal range, but there is a slight decrease in platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are mostly within normal range, except for low potassium levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation level indicates respiratory distress, which can progress to respiratory failure if not addressed promptly.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction, which can worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The patient's low WBC count may indicate an increased risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection is crucial.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, and the use of anticoagulants for AFib increases the risk"

","The patient is a 64-year-old obese female admitted to the ICU for acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on diuretics for heart failure management. 

The patient's recent progress notes indicate a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 26.5% to 23.5%, despite receiving blood transfusions and diuretic therapy. The patient has been diuresed a total of 3 liters over the past 24 hours. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate ranging from 88-114 bpm, blood pressure fluctuating between 123/61 mmHg and 144/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 89%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an arterial blood gas pending. 

The physical examination reveals an obese female who is not in acute distress. The patient is oriented and has appropriate mood and affect. No pallor or cyanosis is noted in the oral mucosa, and the conjunctiva is pink. The neck is supple, but the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is difficult to assess due to the patient's body habitus.

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and COPD on 3L home O2 was admitted from the
   ED with shortness of breath likely related to CHF exacerbation, atrial
   fibrillation with RVR, and chronic lung disease.
   Shortness of Breath
   Etiology of her shortness of breath is most likely related to CHF
   exacerbation worsened with her afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
   Additional factors likely worsening this are obesity hypoventilation,
   obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension
   - continue to diurese her and aim for being 1.5-2L negative today with
   lasix gtt .  Add chlorthiazide as needed.
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue steroid burst with azithro for COPD exacerbation
   - repeat sputum cx
   - see below for plan for afib with RVR
   Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
   Patient has elevated heart rate and this is certainly contributing to
   her worsened diastolic CHF. HR controlled fairly with PO dilt.  She has
   not been a candidate for anticoagulation in the past due to previous GI
   bleeds. According to GI, she has been unable to tolerate a colonoscopy
   or EGD in the past.
   - PO diltiazem 360mg PO daily
   - Heparin bridge to coumadin (start tomorrow)
   - follow-up with GI re EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday to assess for evidence of
   active bleeding or ulcers
   - depending on GI w/u, possible TEE/CV if she has no active GIB
   COPD
   Patient has a history of COPD and is on 3L home O2.
   - continue home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol,
   montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name **]
   - continue steroids and azithromycin since symptoms did not improve
   much with diuresis
   - discontinued theophylline for now due to concern for multiple drug
   interactions and increase xopenex and Atrovent nebulizer treatments
   Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past, although she is
   currently normotensive/borderline hypotensive. Etiology of her
   hypotension is unclear, although likely related to her atrial
   fibrillation.
   - hold antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now
   - continue rate control with diltiazem
   Anemia
   Stable
   - continue iron supplementation
   Hyperglycemia:
   Patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes but has elevated blood
   sugars on steroids. Will need close monitoring of blood sugars while on
   steroids.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical problems including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath likely related to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), and COPD exacerbation.
- The patient's shortness of breath is most likely due to CHF exacerbation worsened by afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
- Additional factors contributing to her condition include obesity hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient is being diuresed with lasix and may need additional diuretic, chlorthiazide, as needed.
- Her electrolytes are to be monitored closely.
- She is on a steroid burst with azithromycin for COPD exacerbation and will have a repeat sputum culture.
- For atrial fibrillation with RVR, the patient is on PO diltiazem for rate control and will undergo a ""heparin bridge"" to coumadin starting tomorrow due to previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds.
- A follow-up with GI is scheduled to assess for evidence of active bleeding or ulcers, and possibly a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)/cardioversion if there are no active GI bleeds.
- The patient's COPD management includes continuing her home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol, montelukast, theophylline, and [**Doctor First Name**].
- Steroids and azithromycin will be continued since symptoms did not improve much with diuresis, and theophylline has been discontinued due to concerns about multiple drug interactions.
- Hypertension management involves holding antihypertensive agents (lisinopril 10) for now and continuing rate control with diltiazem.
- Anemia is stable and will continue with iron supplementation.
- Hyperglycemia requires close monitoring of blood sugars while on steroids.
- ICU care includes nutrition with a low sodium diet, glycemic control with HISS (not specified), lines placed, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's shortness of breath and fluid overload suggest worsening congestive heart failure. This can lead to pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and potentially respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's elevated heart rate and rapid ventricular response contribute to diastolic CHF and increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Rate control and anticoagulation are essential in managing this condition.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and current symptoms indicate a worsening of her lung disease. This can result in increased respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potential respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
4. Obesity hypoventilation: The patient's morbid obesity puts her at risk for hypoventilation, particularly during sleep, which can lead to hypercapnia and respiratory failure.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's obesity and COPD history increase the likelihood of pulmonary hypertension, which can further compromise respiratory function and cardiac output.
6. GI bleeding: The patient's history of previous GI bleeds and the need for a ""heparin bridge"" to coumadin indicate the risk of bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation therapy.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood sugars while on steroids suggest a risk for hyperglycemia"
