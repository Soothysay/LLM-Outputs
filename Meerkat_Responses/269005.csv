   31 year old male with polysubstance abuse currently in rehab who
   presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of
   unknown medication, consistent with TCA versus antichlonigeric
   medication (bentyl)
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Likely secondary to drug ingestion.
   Clinicially suggestive of anticholenergic ingestion, as EKG has
   terminal R in AVR, sligthly wide QRS, slurred downsloping S wave in
   V6.  This points towards TCA/anticholinergic (bentyl) overdose.  Other
   less likely medications that can cause this condition include cocaine,
   sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical
   antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, carbamazepine.
   - f/u on  toxicology recs, especially the length of bicarb gtt and how
   often get ABG
   - Continue bicarbonate drip for 24 hours (150meq in 1 L D5W at
   200cc/h).  Keep pH 7.45-7.55.  This therapy will overcome sodium
   channel blockade and properly alkalinize the serum.
   - if pts pH approaches 7.55 and QRS remains prolonged, consider
   hypertonic saline or placing sodium bicarb in D5 1/4 NS to increase
   sodium load.
   - Follow EKG q4 hours
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - f/u quantitative TCA
   - TCA levels positive in urine and serum, toxicology screen

   - Head CT completed on way to ED, follow up final results
   - Obtain additional information from PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], friends when possible
   - CSF studies WNL

   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated to protect airway in the setting of
   altered mental status.  Currently on AC ventilation 600X14.  FiO2 0.5
   and PEEP 5. On propofol. On bicarb drip D5W with 2 amp bicarb at
   200cc/h.
   - attempt to wean FiO2, consider switch to pressure support,
   spontaneous breathing trial after discussing with Toxicology re length
   of bicarb gtt

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab. He presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of an unknown medication, consistent with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) versus anticholinergic medication (bentyl) overdose.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 133/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, and his EKG shows sinus rhythm with ventricular rate 61, normal axis, QRS duration of 118 msec (improved from >130 yesterday).

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T. However, the TCO2 is 32, glucose is 104 mg/dL, and the electrolytes show slightly low potassium (K+), slightly high sodium (Na+), and normal chloride (Cl-) and magnesium (Mg++) levels.

The patient's imaging shows an endotracheal tube placed correctly with no acute cardiopulmonary process noted.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab. He presented with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of an unknown medication, possibly a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) or anticholinergic medication. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/90 to 115/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is intubated and on assisted ventilation with FiO2 0.5 and PEEP 5. He is also receiving propofol and a bicarbonate drip.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and mildly elevated creatinine level. Troponin T is negative, indicating no cardiac damage. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, show no acute cardiopulmonary process. A head CT completed on the way to the emergency department is pending final results.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including altered mental status likely secondary to drug ingestion, respiratory failure requiring intubation, fever possibly due to anticholinergic medication, depression, polysubstance abuse, and possible seizure disorder.

Plan:

1. Monitor the patient closely and follow EKG every 4 hours.
2. Continue bicarbonate drip for "

   #) Altered mental status: Likely secondary to drug ingestion.
   Clinicially suggestive of anticholenergic ingestion, as EKG has
   terminal R in AVR, sligthly wide QRS, slurred downsloping S wave in
   V6.  This points towards TCA/anticholinergic (bentyl) overdose.  Other
   less likely medications that can cause this condition include cocaine,
   sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical
   antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, carbamazepine.

   channel blockade and properly alkalinize the serum.
   - if pts pH approaches 7.55 and QRS remains prolonged, consider
   hypertonic saline or placing sodium bicarb in D5 1/4 NS to increase
   sodium load.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab.
2. He presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of unknown medication, consistent with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) versus anticholinergic medication (bentyl).
3. The EKG shows terminal R in AVR, slightly wide QRS, and slurred downsloping S wave in V6, which suggests TCA/anticholinergic overdose.
4. Other less likely medications that can cause this condition include cocaine, sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine.
5. The patient has respiratory failure and was intubated to protect the airway in the setting of altered mental status. He is currently on assisted ventilation with FiO2 0.5 and PEEP 5.
6. The patient is on a bicarbonate drip D5W with 2 amp bicarb at 200cc/h to alkalinize the serum and overcome sodium channel blockade.
7. His fever is likely secondary to anticholinergic medication, and other causes have been ruled out.
8. The patient has a history of depression and is taking Prozac and Seroquel.

   Clinicially suggestive of anticholenergic ingestion, as EKG has
   terminal R in AVR, sligthly wide QRS, slurred downsloping S wave in
   V6.  This points towards TCA/anticholinergic (bentyl) overdose.  Other
   less likely medications that can cause this condition include cocaine,
   sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical
   antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, carbamazepine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab. He presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of an unknown medication, consistent with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) versus anticholinergic medication (bentyl). The patient's EKG shows terminal R in AVR, slightly wide QRS, and slurred downsloping S wave in V6, which suggests TCA/anticholinergic overdose. Other medications that can cause this condition include cocaine, sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine. The patient is being monitored on telemetry and is receiving a bicarbonate drip to overcome sodium channel blockade and properly alkalinize the serum. If the pH approaches 7.55 and the QRS remains prolonged, hypertonic saline or placing sodium bicarb in D5 1/4 NS will be considered to increase the sodium load. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Altered mental status: This can be caused by drug ingestion, particularly TCA or anticholinergic medication overdose. Other less likely medications that can cause this condition include cocaine, sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with presumed TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) overdose. He has been intubated for airway protection due to an inability to protect his own airway. The patient is currently in the ICU and remains intubated. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1°C (97%)
- Heart rate: 59 bpm (within normal range)
- Blood pressure: 128/88 mmHg (within normal range)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (within normal range)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and plateau pressure at 12 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, PaO2 of 268 mmHg, and HCO3- of 36 mEq/L. His oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube, and he is receiving oxygen through it.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, and no peripheral edema. Neurologically, the patient is sedated"

   Can wean fio2 to 35% Transition to PS and lighten sedation, can likely
   move to SBT for extubation, but would like to monitor ecgs closely once
   off bicarb initially.
   Overdose seems like TCA based on tox and ECG, though multiple
   substances could contribute to similar picture (anticholinergics in
   particular). Toxicology input appreciated. Will clarify plans with tox
   service, but can likely transition off bicarb and follow ecgs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with presumed tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, intubated for airway protection. He presents with OD (TCA), ECG changes, respiratory failure, and fever. The patient remains intubated and is being treated with bicarbonate gtt. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 128/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's medical history is significant for depression and a probable suicide attempt. Social work and psych consults have been requested when the patient is awake. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.5 K/uL, elevated platelets with a Plt count of 235, and slightly decreased hematocrit with an Hct of 42.3. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Imaging reveals no focal findings on chest X-ray, and ECGs have been reviewed. Microbiology tests, including blood and urine cultures, as well as a lumbar puncture culture, are pending. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 600 mL, RR set at 14, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and SpO2 of 100%. ABG results show a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, HCO3- of 36 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be prevented by maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing daily wake-up tests, and ensuring proper mouth care.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's ECG changes suggest potential cardiac involvement. Close monitoring of the ECG and cardiac enzymes will be necessary to rule out any ischemic changes or myocardial infarction.

3. Infectious Complications: The patient's fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for an infectious process. The pending results of blood and urine cultures, as well as the lumbar puncture culture, will help identify any bacterial infections.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and unresponsiveness indicate potential neurological complications. Frequent neurologic assessments and monitoring of sedation levels will be important to evaluate the patient's neurological status.

5. Hemodynamic Instability: Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and heart rate is essential to detect any hemodynamic instability."

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis secondary to an infection in her right lower leg. She has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and has shown improvement in her vital signs and laboratory values over the past few days.

On the current day, the patient's bicarbonate was discontinued at noon time, and her EKG showed overall improvement after discontinuation. She was successfully extubated, and her potassium levels were low at 2.9 and 3.6, which were repleted. The attending physician spoke with [**Name (NI) 8659**] regarding the patient's medication, Kepakote, but the reason for its administration is unclear. The social worker and psychologist did not see the patient yesterday.

The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics. She is currently receiving various infusions and other ICU medications. There are no changes to her medical or family history. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/71 to 146/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 78.2 kg at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab. He presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of medication consistent with TCA versus anticholinergic medication. The patient was intubated to protect his airway due to altered mental status and respiratory failure, but was successfully extubated yesterday. He has been diagnosed with fever, depression, possible seizure disorder, and code status full.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation to support his breathing due to respiratory failure. Although he was successfully extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory compromise if his mental status deteriorates again.
2. TCA/anticholinergic overdose: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of TCA or anticholinergic medication overdose. Further monitoring and management are required to address any potential complications related to this overdose.
3. Infection: Despite antibiotics being discontinued, the patient's fever persists. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate management will be necessary.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of possible seizure disorder, which may require ongoing treatment and monitoring.
5. Depression: The patient is diagnosed with depression and is currently on medication for it. Regular follow-up and management are essential to prevent any potential complications associated with untreated depression.
6. Polysubstance abuse: The patient's history of polysubstance abuse increases the risk of various medical complications, including withdrawal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab. He presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of medication consistent with TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) versus anticholinergic medication (bentyl). The patient's EKG showed terminal R in AVR, slightly wide QRS, and slurred downsloping S wave in V6, which are indicative of TCA/anticholinergic overdose. Positive TCA levels in urine and serum were also found. Other less likely medications that can cause similar symptoms include cocaine, sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine. Depakote levels were within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory failure initially required intubation to protect the airway, but he was successfully extubated yesterday. He was previously on assisted ventilation with FiO2 weaned to 0.35.

The patient had an initial fever, which is likely secondary to medication overdose (TCA). No other sources of infection were identified, and antibiotics were discontinued upon reaching the floor.

The patient has a history of depression, for which he is prescribed Prozac 20mg qAM and Seroquel 50mg QHS. Psychiatry did not leave recommendations yesterday.

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse currently in rehab. He presents with altered mental status after suspected ingestion of medication consistent with TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) versus anticholinergic medication (bentyl). 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Altered mental status: Likely secondary to drug ingestion, clinically suggestive of anticholinergic ingestion, as EKG has terminal R in AVR, slightly wide QRS, slurred downsloping S wave in V6. Positive TCA levels in urine and serum. Other less likely medications that can cause this condition include cocaine, sympathomimetic agents, proserotinergic agents, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, diphenhydramine, carbamazepine.

- f/u quantitative TCA.
- Head CT completed on way to ED, follow up final results.
- Obtain additional information from PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs)**], friends when possible.
- CSF studies WNL.

2) Respiratory failure: Initially intubated to protect airway in the setting of altered mental status. Patient was transitioned to PS and successfully extubated yesterday.
- Previously on AC vent 600X14 with FiO2 weaned to 0.35.
- FiO2 was weaned and patient was able to be extubated successfully.

3) Fever: Initially febrile, likely secondary to medication overdose (TCA). No other sources of infection. Will follow up on culture data.
- U/a negative.
- CSF gram stain showed no organisms.
- CXR within normal limits.
- CT head: no acute intracranial abnormalities.
- Antibiotics d/c on reaching the floor.

4) Depression:
- Psychiatry did not leave recommendations yesterday.
- Prozac 20mg qAM.
- Seroquel 50mg QHS.

5) Polysubstance Abuse: Alcohol, cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepine addiction documented. Currently in rehab. LFTS WNL (sent due to unknown ingestion of other medications).
- Social work consult did not leave recommendations yesterday.

6) Possible seizure disorder: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to withdrawal symptoms. At therapeutic levels. On day 6 of 7 with last day on [**2190-7-22**].
- Depakote 500mg [**Hospital**].
- [**Hospital3 8660**] was [**Name (NI) 161**], and they were not clear as to why patient was receiving depakote.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse and is currently in rehab. There is a possibility of a seizure disorder, which may be secondary to withdrawal symptoms.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory failure, but was successfully extubated yesterday.
3. Fever: The patient initially had a fever, which may be secondary to medication overdose. It is important to follow up on culture data to rule out any infection.
4. Altered mental status: The patient presented with altered mental status, which is likely secondary to drug ingestion. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and continue with appropriate management.
5. Possible overdose: The patient's ingestion of medication consistent with T"

   Overdose appears c/w TCA based on tox and ECG, though multiple

   particular). Toxicology input appreciated. His bicarb gtt is off and
   his QRS has narrowed on f/u ecg.  He does have changes in TW
   morphology- those these are not c/w TCA -changes and may be his
   baseline.  Will clarify w/ tox service.  Will need ecgs monitored on

   He remains af. Suspect his temp at presentation was related to
   toxins/OD. No clear sources and cx's remain neg to date.  Unclear

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male who presented with presumed TCA or anticholinergic overdose. The patient was intubated for airway protection and has since been extubated successfully. The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

- Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
- Heart rate: 106 bpm (normal range: 65-106 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 139/71 mmHg (with readings ranging from 92/56 mmHg to 155/100 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on room air

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of back pain. Physical examination findings include no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and warm skin without edema. Neurological examination reveals the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and showing purposeful movement without focal deficits.

Laboratory results show the following values:
- Hemoglobin: 14.0 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 7.3 K/uL (with previous readings ranging from 9.5 to 9.9 K/uL)
- Platelet count: 235 K/uL (with previous readings ranging from 180 to 203 K/uL)

   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M with PSA presents with presumed TCA or anticholinergic
   overdose, intubated for airway protection
   Issues include:
          OD (TCA)
          ECG changes
              Back pain
          Resp failure (extubated)
          Fever
              sz d/o
             depression
   Overdose seems like TCA based on tox and ECG, though multiple
   substances could contribute to similar picture (anticholinergics in
   particular). Toxicology input appreciated. His bicarb gtt remains off
   and his qrs has narrowed on ecg.  He does have changes in Tw
   morhpolgoiy--uncelar fi this is related to OD or his baseline.  WIll
   d/w tox service. He remains comfortbale from resp standpoint post
   extubation with clear imaging.
   Febrile initially. Likely related to toxins/OD.  AF since, with no
   other clear sources.  Cx's remain neg to date.  Back pain unclear if
   related to prior [**Name (NI) 8673**] vs LP.  Can use tyleonol and would follow and

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with presumed TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) or anticholinergic overdose, who was intubated for airway protection. The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently comfortable from a respiratory standpoint. There are concerns regarding potential medical complications related to the overdose, including ECG changes, fever, and back pain. The patient also has a history of depression and a suspected suicide attempt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Due to the TCA overdose, the patient may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring of the ECG and cardiac status is necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated successfully, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the airway becomes compromised or if respiratory drive decreases.
3. Seizures: TCA overdose can lead to seizures, which can be a medical emergency. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity is essential.
4. Hyperthermia: The patient initially had a fever, which could be related to the toxins/overdose. Close monitoring of body temperature is necessary to prevent further increases in temperature.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: TCA overdose can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Monitoring the patient's gastrointestinal status is important.
6. Renal dysfunction: Prolonged hypotension or decreased renal perfusion"
