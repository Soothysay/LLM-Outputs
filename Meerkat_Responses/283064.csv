   #  Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to alveolar hypoventilation
   due to LLL collapse causing a significant respiratory acidosis.  This
   was most likely a result of the pt lying on his left side for many
   hours during the surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased
   pulmonary secretions. The secretions have continued, and sedation was
   increased fent 200 / versed 4 at 4am.
   - monitor ABGs closely
   - CXR appears stable from yesterday afternoon, will repeat tomorrow AM
   - attempt to wean again today, can consider precedex if necessary given
   ETOH/percocet history
   - albuterol MDI q2 prn
   - aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   - caution with further IVF

   -> pre-renal, given 500cc NS bolus over 2 hrs twice overnight. UOP has
   not increased after IVF challenge, raising concern for ATN
   - cont to monitor UOP, have given 500cc at 5am

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement, resulting in large volume blood loss. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and remains intubated.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. This was likely a result of the patient lying on his left side for many hours during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. Sedation was increased with fentanyl 200 / versed 4 at 4am.

The patient's decreased urine output raises concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus pre-renal azotemia. Although the urine analysis (Una) is less than 10, the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.05%, and the intrabdominal pressure is less than 15. The urine output has not increased after the intravenous fluid challenge, which raises concern for ATN.

The patient's temperature spiked to 101 overnight, and the white blood cell count trended down slightly to 21. Antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn).

The patient's elevated lactate level raises concern for hypoperfusion in the setting of significant volume loss during surgery. He received 1 liter of normal saline upon arrival to the ICU and now has improved to around 1.7.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He has been admitted to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated. The patient has several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, decreased urine output, and an infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is elevated and he is experiencing atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. He has been started on metoprolol IV and diltiazem to control his heart rate.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe collapse. This could be a result of prolonged lying on his left side during surgery, volume overload, and increased pulmonary secretions. The patient's carbon dioxide levels are in the low 50s, indicating stable hypercapnia. He has been extubated and placed on CPAP, but will need close monitoring of ABGs and daily CXRs.
3. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output is decreased, raising concerns for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pre-renal azotemia. Although the patient's creatinine is trending down, further monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient has an infection indicated by his elevated white blood cell count and sputum culture showing growth"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent prolonged intramedullary nail removal and bipolar right hip replacement. He is still intubated and transferred to the ICU for monitoring. 

The patient has multiple medical complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which were partially responsive to metoprolol IV. Subsequently, he developed atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H was continued, and diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given. The current heart rate is in the range of 110s-120s. Further control of the heart rate is planned.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe collapse. This may be a result of prolonged pressure on the left side during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The patient's carbon dioxide levels are in the low 50s, indicating stable hypercapnia. He was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on CPAP. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases and daily chest X-rays is recommended. Albuterol MDI every two puffs as needed, and chest PT should be considered. Caution should be exercised with further intravenous fluids.

3. Decreased urine output: There is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient tolerated extubation well and was started on CIWA protocol with Valium, receiving 80mg overnight. He was also given morphine for pain, receiving 12g overnight. The patient could not be fitted for a brace due to sedation and pulled art line. No known drug allergies were reported. The patient received various medications including Cefazolin, Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn), and Vancomycin. Infusions included Famotidine (Pepcid), Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Morphine Sulfate, and Diazepam (Valium).

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), current temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 104 bpm (range 103-122 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 117/47 mmHg to 183/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (range 15-31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and his weight is currently 130.6 kg compared to the admission weight of 118 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,404 mL and output of 1,196 mL, with a negative balance of 208 mL.

The patient requires respiratory support with an aerosol-cool O2 delivery device, standby ventilator mode, Vt of 748 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 17, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, PIP of 11 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 96%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 53 mmHg, PaO2 of 164 mmHg, and HCO3 of 81 mEq/L. Peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, neurologic examination is also not assessed, and labs/radiology results are provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and ABG results suggest ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Acute renal failure: Elevated creatinine levels and low urine output indicate possible acute renal failure.
3. Hypovolemia: Negative fluid balance and high central venous pressure may suggest hypovolemia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's initial admission for severe sepsis and ongoing fever suggest the possibility of ongoing infection.
5. Delirium: Impaired arousal, attention, and cognition indicate the possibility of delirium.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and risk factors may increase the risk of DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and use of medications that can predispose to stress ulcers may increase the risk.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk for VAP."

   This is a 48 year-old man s/p prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R
   hip replacement complicated by large volume blood loss, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for monitoring still intubated.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to alveolar hypoventilation
   due to LLL collapse causing a significant respiratory acidosis.  This
   was most likely a result of the pt lying on his left side for many
   hours during the surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased
   pulmonary secretions. The secretions have continued, and sedation was
   increased fent 200 / versed 4 at 4am. CO2 in low 50s, likely stable
   hypercapnia given smoking history. Now on PS 5/5.
   - monitor ABGs closely / daily CXRs
   - attempt to wean again today with SBT, HOB elevated may help, can
   consider precedex if necessary given ETOH/percocet history
   - may need CIWA scale after extubation given h/o ETOH
   - albuterol MDI q2 prn
   - aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   - caution with further IVF
   .
   #  Decreased urine output:  Concern for ATN vs pre-renal. Although
   Una<10, FeNa 0.05%, intrabd pressure < 15, U/A improved, no e/o ATN/AIN
   -> pre-renal, given 500cc NS bolus over 2 hrs twice overnight. UOP has
   not increased after IVF challenge, raising concern for ATN.
   - cont to monitor UOP, have given 500cc at 5am
   - recheck afternoon lytes
   - can re-attempt fluid challenge after extubation
   .
   # ID: spiked to 101 overnight. WBC trended down slightly to 21. Sputum
   w/ GNR, GPR.
   - changed to vanc/unasyn, can consider [**Last Name (un) **] or zosyn for pseudomonal
   coverage if spikes again
   - f/u BCx, bronch washings
   #  s/p hip surgery:
   - ortho recs: unchanged today (see below)
   - start lovenox 30 [**Hospital1 **] in am
   - AP pelvis
   - strict posterior hip precautions
   - abduction pillow btw legs
   - hob not greater than 90
   .
   #  Elevated Lactate:  Concern for hypoperfusion in the setting of
   significant volume loss during surgery.  Received 1L LR on arrival to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Now improved to around 1.7
   - cont to monitor lactate
   - expect to improve with IVF

","The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He experienced large volume blood loss during surgery, resulting in respiratory failure due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. This collapse was likely a result of the patient lying on his left side for many hours during the surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The secretions have continued, and sedation was increased at 4 am. The patient is currently on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. It is important to monitor arterial blood gases (ABGs) closely and perform daily chest X-rays. The patient should be attempted to wean from mechanical ventilation today using a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), with the head of bed (HOB) elevated and consideration of precedex if necessary given the patient's history of ethanol and opioid use. 

The patient also has decreased urine output, which raises concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus pre-renal azotemia. Although the patient's urea nitrogen (Una) level is less than 10, fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.05%, and intrabdominal pressure is less than 15, the urine analysis (U/A) has improved, and there are no signs of ATN or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Therefore, it is more likely"

   This is a 48 year-old man s/p prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R
   hip replacement complicated by large volume blood loss, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for monitoring still intubated.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to alveolar hypoventilation
   due to LLL collapse causing a significant respiratory acidosis.  This
   was most likely a result of the pt lying on his left side for many
   hours during the surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased
   pulmonary secretions. The secretions have continued, and sedation was
   increased fent 200 / versed 4 at 4am. CO2 in low 50s, likely stable
   hypercapnia given smoking history. Now on PS 5/5.
   - monitor ABGs closely / daily CXRs
   - attempt to wean again today with SBT, HOB elevated may help, can
   consider precedex if necessary given ETOH/percocet history
   - may need CIWA scale after extubation given h/o ETOH
   - albuterol MDI q2 prn
   - aggressive suctioning and chest PT
   - caution with further IVF
   .
   #  Decreased urine output:  Concern for ATN vs pre-renal. Although
   Una<10, FeNa 0.05%, intrabd pressure < 15, U/A improved, no e/o ATN/AIN
   -> pre-renal, given 500cc NS bolus over 2 hrs twice overnight. UOP has
   not increased after IVF challenge, raising concern for ATN.
   - cont to monitor UOP, have given 500cc at 5am
   - recheck afternoon lytes
   - can re-attempt fluid challenge after extubation
   .
   # ID: spiked to 101 overnight. WBC trended down slightly to 21. Sputum
   w/ GNR, GPR.
   - changed to vanc/unasyn, can consider [**Last Name (un) **] or zosyn for pseudomonal
   coverage if spikes again
   - f/u BCx, bronch washings
   #  s/p hip surgery:
   - ortho recs: unchanged today (see below)
   - start lovenox 30 [**Hospital1 **] in am
   - AP pelvis
   - strict posterior hip precautions
   - abduction pillow btw legs
   - hob not greater than 90
   .
   #  Elevated Lactate:  Concern for hypoperfusion in the setting of
   significant volume loss during surgery.  Received 1L LR on arrival to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]. Now improved to around 1.7
   - cont to monitor lactate
   - expect to improve with IVF

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement.
- He experienced large volume blood loss and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring, still intubated.
- The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was partially controlled with metoprolol.
- He then transitioned into atrial flutter with a 2:1 block and was given diltiazem.
- The patient's current heart rate is in the 110s-120s range.
- He is at risk for respiratory failure due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe collapse.
- Sedation was increased, and the patient was successfully extubated yesterday and placed on CPAP.
- There is concern for decreased urine output, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis or pre-renal azotemia.
- The patient's creatinine level is trending down from 2.2 yesterday to 1.9 today.
- The patient has an infection, as indicated by elevated white blood cell count and presence of GNR and GPR in the sputum.
- He is being treated with vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam, with consideration for additional coverage if necessary.
- The patient's lactate level has improved from around 2.2 to 1.7 on [**8-22**].
- Ortho recs: unchanged today ("

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent prolonged surgery for the removal of an intramedullary nail and bipolar right hip replacement. He experienced large-volume blood loss during the procedure and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring, still intubated.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to alveolar hypoventilation due to left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. This collapse may be a result of the patient lying on his left side for an extended period during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The patient's CO2 levels are in the low 50s, indicating stable hypercapnia, likely exacerbated by his smoking history. The plan is to closely monitor ABGs and daily CXRs, attempt to wean off mechanical ventilation with a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), elevate the head of bed (HOB), and consider using precedex if necessary.

2. Decreased urine output: There is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus pre-renal causes. Although the patient's urea (Una) is less than 10, fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.05%, and intrabdominal pressure is less than 15, the urine analysis (U/A) has improved, with no evidence of ATN/AIN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He has been admitted to the ICU due to complications from large-volume blood loss. The patient is still intubated and on CPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of alveolar hypoventilation due to LLL collapse, which could have resulted in significant respiratory acidosis. This may be exacerbated by the patient's lying position during surgery, volume overload, and increased pulmonary secretions. The patient's current condition includes being on CPAP and requiring close monitoring of ABGs and daily CXRs.

2. Acidosis: The patient has respiratory acidosis likely secondary to hypoventilation. This condition needs to be managed by improving ventilation and avoiding further volume overload.

3. Hypovolemia: The patient experienced significant volume loss during surgery, leading to hypovolemia. Close monitoring of UOP and Cr levels is necessary to assess renal function.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to hypoperfusion in the setting of significant volume loss during surgery. Monitoring UOP and Cr levels is essential.

5. Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC count and sputum culture results indicating the presence of GNR and GPR. Antibiotic therapy needs to be adjusted accordingly.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and atr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement.
- He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated.
- The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, decreased urine output, and infection.
- Respiratory failure is likely due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe (LLL) collapse.
- Atrial fibrillation was treated with metoprolol and diltiazem.
- Decreased urine output may be due to pre-renal causes, and the patient's creatinine level is trending down.
- The patient is currently on antibiotics for an infection, which is showing improvement.
- Post-operative hip precautions are in place to prevent complications related to the surgery.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by LLL collapse. Close monitoring of ABGs and daily CXRs is recommended. Albuterol MDI can be used as needed, and a chest PT should be considered.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Metoprolol IV and diltiazem were given for rate control, and the patient's heart"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement.
- He experienced large volume blood loss and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring, still intubated.
- The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, decreased urine output, and infection.
- Respiratory failure is likely due to alveolar hypoventilation caused by left lower lobe (LLL) collapse.
- Atrial fibrillation was managed with metoprolol and diltiazem.
- Decreased urine output is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pre-renal causes, but it appears to be resolving.
- The patient has an infection with GNR and GPR in his sputum.
- Post-hip surgery precautions include strict posterior hip precautions, an abduction pillow between legs, and avoiding hobbling at angles greater than 90 degrees.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, arterial line placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and requires close monitoring of ABGs and daily CXRs.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which needs to be monitored and managed with appropriate medications.
3. Decreased urine output: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement surgery. He experienced large volume blood loss during the procedure and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. The patient is still intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on CPAP.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to alveolar hypoventilation due to LLL collapse. This was caused by the patient lying on his left side for many hours during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. Sedation was increased to address this issue, and the patient's CO2 levels are being closely monitored. Daily CXRs will be performed, and the patient is prescribed albuterol MDI every two hours as needed and a chest PT.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to 180s yesterday. He was given metoprolol IV 5 mg x 3, which resulted in a partial response with a decreased heart rate in the 140s. The patient then converted into atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H was started, and subsequently, diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given, resulting in a good response with a heart rate of 100s-110s."

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/62 to 191/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on CPAP mask with supplemental oxygen and has an ABG result of ///28/. 

The physical examination notes that the patient responds but neurologic assessment, movement, tone, and other assessments could not be performed. 

Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and abnormal kidney function. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired airway clearance, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/gas exchange, pain control, respiratory and mixed"

   This is a 48 year-old man s/p prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R
   hip replacement complicated by large volume blood loss, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for monitoring still intubated.
   #  Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to alveolar hypoventilation
   due to LLL collapse causing a significant respiratory acidosis.  This
   was most likely a result of the pt lying on his left side for many
   hours during the surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased
   pulmonary secretions. The secretions have continued, and sedation was
   increased fent 200 / versed 4 at 4am. CO2 in low 50s, likely stable
   hypercapnia given smoking history. Successfully extubated yesterday
   currently on CPAP.
   - monitor ABGs closely / daily CXRs
   - albuterol MDI q2 prn
   - chest PT
   #  Atrial Fibrillation:  Pt went into afib w/ RVR up to the 180s
   yesterday.  Was given metoprolol IV 5 mg x 3 with partial response, HR
   down 140s, subsequently converted into atrial flutter w/ 2:1 block.
   Metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H was started.  Pt was still tachy to the 140s and
   Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given w/ good response.  Current HR
   100s-110s.  BP was stable throughout.
   -cont metoprolol 5 mg iv q4h

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar right hip replacement. He has been admitted to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure secondary to alveolar hypoventilation due to left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. This was caused by the patient lying on his left side for many hours during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The patient has been successfully extubated and is currently on CPAP. It is important to monitor ABGs and daily CXRs, provide albuterol MDI as needed, and perform a chest PT.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to 180s yesterday. He was given metoprolol IV 5 mg x 3, which had a partial response, lowering his heart rate to the 140s. Subsequently, he converted into atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H was started, and Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given with a good response, bringing his heart rate to the 100s-110s. The current plan is to continue metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H.

3. Decreased urine output"

   due to LLL collapse causing a significant respiratory acidosis.  This
   was most likely a result of the pt lying on his left side for many

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He experienced large volume blood loss and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring, still intubated. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/gas exchange, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), respiratory acidosis, mixed acidosis, hypovolemia (volume depletion without shock), and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure secondary to alveolar hypoventilation due to left lower lobe collapse. This may be caused by the patient lying on his left side for many hours during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to the 180s yesterday. Metoprolol IV was given with partial response, reducing the heart rate to the 140s. Subsequently, the patient converted into atrial flutter with 2:1 block. Metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H was started, and Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given with good response, achieving a stable heart rate in the 100s-110s.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male now admitted following total hip replacement with prolonged
   OR procedure and in the setting of significant EtOH abuse has had high
   requirement for benzodiazepine replacement.  He has maintained stable
   respiratory status following extubation.  He has had encouraging
   decreased in WBC count across time and despite continued high dosing of
   benzodiazepines he has maintained continued good capacity to maintain
   airway but still has limited gag reflex.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient extubated at this time, persistent
   altered mental status
   -Continue suctioning
   -Utilize NIV as needed for respiratory supression
   -Continue with B-agonists as needed
   -OOB when possible
   2)Altered Mental Status-This is clearly multi-factorial and driven by
   EtOH withdrawl and with benzo Rx needed.
   -Valium PRN
   -CIWA scale
   -Thiamine/Folate/MVI
   -Continue close examinations
   3)Acute Renal Failure-Likely pre-renal
   -Renal dose all medications
   -Continue to follow Cr
   -IVF and urine lytes for any worsening
   -Goal I/O is even to negative across the day today.
   4)Leukocytosis-Improving WBC count
   -Unasyn continuing and current Rx is directed at possible pulmonary
   source of infection but with mixed flora noted on bronchoscopy done in
   the setting of active infection.
   -Will continue with broad spectrum ABX until sensitivities noted and
   bronchoscopy finalized
   -Primary insult may well be aspiration noted around time of intubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU following a total hip replacement surgery. The patient has a history of significant alcohol abuse and required prolonged mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient was recently extubated but continues to have altered mental status, likely due to ethanol withdrawal and benzodiazepine replacement therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of recurring respiratory failure, especially with limited gag reflex and ongoing benzodiazepine therapy.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to ethanol withdrawal and benzodiazepine replacement therapy. Close monitoring and appropriate management of withdrawal symptoms are necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient shows signs of pre-renal acute renal failure, which requires careful monitoring of renal function and fluid balance.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the source of infection needs to be identified and managed accordingly.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which increases the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.

6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient's impaired airway clearance and arousal response may contribute to OSA,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement, resulting in large volume blood loss. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and remains intubated.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, likely due to HAP (initially LLL infiltrate), now with a collapsed RLL. This may be a result of the patient lying on his left side during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions.
- The patient's WBC count is trending down from 21.1 to 5.8, indicating a possible improvement in infection.
- BAL with H. flu + beta lactamase (amp resistant), S. pneumo is pending.
- The patient has been prescribed vanc/zosyn for presumed HAP and will have repeat CXR today. Deep suction/chest PT and resend sputum are also planned.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation was partially responsive to metoprolol IV and subsequently converted into atrial flutter with 2:1 block. Diltiazem 10 mg IV was given with good response. The patient's BPs were in the low 200s with HRs in the 110s, and lopressor was increased to 10 IV q4.
- The patient's decreased urine output was initially concerning for ATN"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo male s/p hip repair with post operative course complicated by
   significant EtOH withdrawl.  This has been complicated by significant
   respiratory failure and with recurrent and persistent fevers likely
   attributable to both EtOH withdrawl and pneumonia resolution.
   Encouragingly patient has had capacity to maintain oxygenation at
   reasonable levels wtih FIO2=0.4
   1)Hip Repair
completed, pain controlled
   2)EtOH Withdrawl-
   -valium 40mg in past 24 hours
   -Thiamine
   -Based upon examination this morning patient has decreased
   responsiveness and concern for excess sedation in the setting of
   continued autonomic activation
   -Clonidine for withdrawl
   -Valium to continue
   -Haldol as needed
   3)Hypoxemia-
   -Pneumonia--Primary contributor to respiratory failure in addition to
   mental status.  He has had S. Pneumoniae and H. Flu identified on
   initial cultures.  We have concern for persistent active pneumonia with
   fever, sputum, hypoxemia.
                    -will broaden to Vanco/Zosyn
                    -Albuterol to continue as needed
   -Right Lower Lobe Collapse-
                    -will need to actively participate in chest PT
                    -In interim he needs NT suctioning
                    -CXR in morning
   -Aspiration
Raised as a concern
will very NGT placement
                    -CXR this morning to confirm NGT placement and
   continue RX
   4)Hypernatremia-
   1.8 liters/d free water given over past 24 hours
   Is 5 liter free water deficit
will need to be replaced over next 24-36

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent hip repair surgery and developed significant complications post-operatively. These complications include ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, respiratory failure, and recurrent fevers. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, and his clinical condition has worsened due to an inability to clear a significant pulmonary infection. 

Medical Complications:
1. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of EtOH withdrawal, which include autonomic activation and decreased responsiveness.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, primarily due to pneumonia, which is causing hypoxemia and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. There is concern for persistent active pneumonia, as evidenced by fever and sputum production.
4. Right Lower Lobe Collapse: The patient has right lower lobe collapse, which needs to be actively treated with chest physiotherapy and NT suctioning.
5. Aspiration: There is a concern for aspiration due to the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT).
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected by administering free water over the next 24-36 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium Tremens (DTs): The patient may develop DTs, which"

   volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The secretions have
   continued to be greenish and concerning. Fentanyl/versed sedation
   weaned off. CO2 in low 50s, likely stable hypercapnia given smoking

- The patient has multiple medical problems including hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, decreased urine output, hypernatremia, and impaired muscle performance.
- The patient's initial hypoxemia was likely due to HAP (initially LLL infiltrate) and is now complicated by a collapsed right lower lobe (RLL) on CXR. The secretions have been greenish and concerning. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on BiPAP.
- The patient's WBC count is trending down from 16.5 to 5.1, indicating a possible improvement in infection. BAL with H. flu + beta lactamase (amp resistant), S. pneumoniae (Cx above) suggests a respiratory infection.
- The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed HAP. Repeat CXR today and deep suction/chest PT are planned.
- The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which was partially responsive to metoprolol IV and subsequently converted into atrial flutter with 2:1 block. Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given with good response. The patient's blood pressure in the low 200s with HRs in"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He is still intubated and admitted to the ICU for monitoring. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had low oxygen levels due to HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), which was likely caused by lying on his left side for many hours during surgery. This was compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The patient's secretions have remained greenish and concerning. He successfully underwent extubation yesterday and is currently on BiPAP. The patient's WBC count is trending down, indicating a potential improvement. BAL results showed H. influenzae beta-lactamase positive (ampicillin resistant) and S. pneumoniae. The patient also has components of respiratory depression and withdrawal contributing to hypoxemia.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to 180s yesterday. He was given metoprolol IV 5 mg x 3 with partial response, reducing the heart rate to the 140s. Subsequently, he converted into atrial flutter with 2:1 block. Metoprolol 5 mg IV Q4H was started, and Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1 was given with a good response. The patient's blood pressure was in the low 200s, with heart rates in the 110s, and he was given CIWA and increased lopressor to 10 q4. He is currently on 50 tid po lopressor.

3. Decreased urine output: There is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) vs pre-renal azotemia. Although the patient's urea nitrogen (Una) is less than 10, the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.05%, and the intrabdominal pressure is less than 15. The urine analysis has improved, showing no evidence of ATN/AIN. The patient's acute tubular necrosis is now resolving, as indicated by the improvement in creatinine levels and good urine output of 70-80cc/hr. The goal of achieving a negative fluid balance of 1L was reached yesterday.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level increased from 151 to 153 today. To address this, the patient will receive 250cc of free water through tube feeds every four hours. The sodium level will be rechecked later today.

5. s/p hip surgery: The patient needs follow-up with orthopedic recommendations, including strict posterior hip precautions, an abduction pillow between legs, and avoiding a hobble exceeding 90 degrees.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will continue to be provided through a replete with fiber (full) regimen at a rate of 60 mL/hour. Glycemic control is also important in managing the patient's condition. The patient has multiple lines, including a 16-gauge line placed on 08/20/2022 and a 20-gauge line placed on 08/23/2022. Prophylaxis measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be continued. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

","The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement, resulting in large volume blood loss. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated. The patient's medical history includes hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/gas exchange, pain control, respiratory acidosis, mixed acidosis, hypovolemia, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes decreased urine output with a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pre-renal azotemia. The patient's serum sodium level is elevated at 153. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down from 16.5 to 5.1.

The patient's current treatment plan includes the administration of vancomycin andzosyn for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), repeat chest X-ray, deep suctioning, and chest physiotherapy. The patient is also receiving clonidine for sedation and prn haldol for agitation. Albuterol MDI is given every two hours as needed.

The patient's atrial fibrillation was managed with metoprolol IV and subsequently converted into atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Diltiazem 10 mg IV was given with good response. The patient's blood pressure"

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and collapsed right lower lobe suggest the possibility of acute respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygen saturation and repeated chest X-rays will help assess the progression of this condition.

2. Infection: The presence of greenish pulmonary secretions and positive cultures for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae indicate a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotics have been initiated to treat this infection.

3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of metoprolol and diltiazem suggest an ongoing risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate and rhythm is essential.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine, and the findings on urinalysis raise concerns for acute kidney injury (AKI). Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.

5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's elevated sodium level indicates hypernatremia. Careful management of fluid administration is required to correct this imbalance.

   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely secondary to HAP (initially LLL infiltrate), now
   CXR shows ?collapsed RLL. This was most likely a result of the pt lying
   on his left side for many hours during the surgery, compounded by
   volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The secretions have
   continued to be greenish and concerning. Fentanyl/versed sedation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He experienced large volume blood loss and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. The patient is still intubated and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, respiratory failure, acidosis, hypovolemia, renal failure, and pain control issues.

The patient's hypoxemia is likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by lying on his left side during surgery, volume overload, and increased pulmonary secretions. He was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on BiPAP. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating a decreasing infection.

Treatment plans include administering vancomycin andzosyn for presumed HAP, repeating a chest X-ray, performing deep suction and chest physiotherapy, changing the CIWA scale to every three hours, continuing clonidine and haloperidol as needed, and using albuterol MDI every two hours as needed.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation, for which he was given metoprolol IV and subsequently converted into atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Diltiazem was given with a good response. The patient's blood pressure has been in the low 200s"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He is still intubated and admitted to the ICU for monitoring. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypernatremia, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which may be secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). There is a concern about a collapsed right lower lobe (RLL) due to the patient lying on his left side for many hours during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) up to the 180s yesterday. He was partially responsive to metoprolol IV and subsequently converted into atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. Diltiazem was given with a good response, and the patient's heart rate was controlled.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired respiration/gas exchange due to the underlying respiratory issues and potential complications from being intubated.

4. Renal Failure: The patient initially showed signs of acute renal failure, but it is now resolving with improving daily creatinine levels and good urine output.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is"

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement complicated by large volume blood loss. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is high at 147. This could be due to free water deficit and dehydration. The calculated free water deficit was 4L, and the patient is receiving free water through tube feeds to correct the sodium levels.

2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has received Valium for his CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure) and has shown agitation. The physician is considering alternate causes for his delirium, including hypernatremia, pain, and sundowning (aggitation mostly at night). The CIWA and morphine dosing will be reassessed, and Zyprexa may be considered for his agitation.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient initially had an LLL infiltrate, which was likely caused by lying on his left side during surgery. This was compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The secretions are still greenish and concerning. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on BiPAP. His WBC is trending down, and he has been afebrile overnight. BAL results show H. flu + beta lactamase (amp resistant) and S. pneumo"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement complicated by large volume blood loss. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level was initially high at 153, which has been corrected to 147 with free water repletion. The calculated free water deficit was 4L.

2. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient has received a large amount of Valium for his CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure Scale) and ranges from barely arousable to agitation. Alternate causes for his delirium, including hypernatremia, pain, and sundowning (agitation mostly at night), should be considered. The CIWA will be discontinued for now to reassess the patient.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels are likely secondary to Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP), initially with a left lower lobe infiltrate. The chest X-ray shows a possibly collapsed right lower lobe. This was most likely caused by the patient lying on his left side for many hours during surgery, compounded by volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The secretions have continued to be greenish and concerning. Fentanyl/versed sedation has been weaned off, and the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent an IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He experienced large volume blood loss and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring, still intubated. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including Valium, morphine, and zyprexa for alcohol withdrawal, pain, and delirium.

The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 148, indicating hypernatremia. He is being given free water through tube feeds to help correct this condition.

The patient's platelet count has been decreasing steadily since admission, with today's count at 56 from 85 yesterday. This could be due to HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) or drug reaction.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with successful extubation yesterday and currently on BiPAP. However, he still requires albuterol MDI q2 prn for respiratory symptoms.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is stable without further episodes on the current regimen of 50 tid po lopressor and clonidine 0.4 daily.

There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) vs pre-renal azotemia. However, the patient's urine output is now around 90-100 cc/hr, indicating resolution of ATN.

Post-operative care for the hip surgery includes strict posterior hip precautions, abduction pillow between legs, and limited hip movement to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He experienced large volume blood loss and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. He remains intubated. The patient's sodium level is elevated at 148, indicating hypernatremia. He has received a large amount of Valium for agitation, but the cause of his delirium is still being evaluated. His platelet count has been decreasing steadily since admission, with a current count of 56 from 85 yesterday. This may be due to HIT or drug reaction. The patient likely has hypoxemia secondary to HAP, now with a collapsed right lower lobe. He was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on BiPAP. His WBC is trending down, indicating improvement. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is stable without further episodes. He is currently on a regimen of 50 tid po lopressor and clonidine 0.4 daily. The patient's decreased urine output was initially concerning for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus pre-renal azotemia. However, his urine output has improved, and his creatinine is steadily improving. He will continue to be monitored for any signs of ATN. The patient has several other medical issues, including alcohol withdrawal, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/g"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may be due to dehydration and fluid imbalances.

2. Alcohol withdrawal/pain/delirium: The patient has received valium for CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale) and has been experiencing agitation. Other causes for delirium are being considered, including hypernatremia, pain, and sundowning (aggitation at night).

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing steadily since admission. This could be due to HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia) or drug reaction.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels are likely secondary to HAP (Healthcare-associated Pneumonia), initially with a left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient's position during surgery, volume overload, and increased pulmonary secretions may have contributed to this condition. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on BiPAP.

5. Acidosis: The patient has respiratory acidosis, possibly due to hypoventilation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) history.

6. Hypovolemia: The patient has volume depletion without shock, possibly due to large volume blood loss during surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent a prolonged nail removal and subsequent bipolar hip replacement. He experienced significant blood loss during the surgeries and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring, still intubated. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypernatremia, alcohol withdrawal, thrombocytopenia, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and respiratory failure. He has received various medications and treatments for his conditions, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is being weaned off sedation. His laboratory values show improvement in some areas but remain concerning in others. The patient is expected to continue receiving ICU-level care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to neurological complications such as confusion, seizures, or coma if not managed properly.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient may experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including agitation, tremors, seizures, or delirium tremens. Appropriate management with benzodiazepines is crucial to prevent these complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating a potential risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent hemorrhagic complications.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring and respiratory support may be required"

   - Free water is being given through tube feeds at 250cc every 4 hours.
   - Sodium levels will be rechecked in the afternoon.

2. The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms, including delirium.
   - Valium has been administered to manage CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure) symptoms.
   - Other potential causes for delirium, such as hypernatremia, pain, and sundowning, are being considered.
   - Morphine is being given as needed for pain relief.
   - Zyprexa may be considered if agitation persists overnight.

3. Thrombocytopenia is present, with a platelet count decreasing from 85 to 56.
   - HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) or drug reaction is being considered.
   - A complete blood count will be checked in the afternoon.

4. Hypoxemia is present, likely secondary to HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia).
   - The patient initially had a left lower lobe infiltrate.
   - A CXR (chest X-ray) showed a possibly collapsed right lower lobe.
   - The patient's secretions have been greenish and concerning.
   - Fentanyl/versed sedation has been weaned"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male who underwent prolonged nail removal and bipolar hip replacement with complications of large volume blood loss. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and is still intubated.

The patient's current medical issues include hypernatremia (high sodium levels), alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired airway clearance, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/gas exchange, pain control (acute and chronic), respiratory acidosis, mixed acidosis, hypovolemia (without shock), acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

The plan includes discontinuing the use of Valium for alcohol withdrawal to reassess the patient, decreasing morphine dosing to reassess the patient's pain management, starting zyprexa for agitation, continuing free water repletion to address hypernatremia, weaning off sedation, and initiating treatment for pneumonia. The patient is currently on BiPAP and has shown improvement in his condition.

Other interventions include continuing lopressor for atrial fibrillation, restarting Unasyn for infection, and monitoring for decreased urine output. The patient's post-operative care will involve following up with orthopedic recommendations, using posterior hip precautions, providing an abduction pillow between legs, and limiting the patient's hip angle to less than 90 degrees.

Nutrition and glycemic control are being closely"

   This is a 48 year-old man s/p prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R
   hip replacement complicated by large volume blood loss, transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for monitoring.  Subsequently developed PNA w left lower lobe
   colapse and EtOH withdrawal.

   #Withdrawal/pain/delirum:  Pt has received a large amount of valium for
   his CIWA and ranges from barely arousable to aggitation.  Cosidering
   alternate causes for his delirum including hypernatremia, pain,
   sundowning (aggitation is mostly at night).  Not agitated overnight but
   was agitated and threatening in the am.  Received no meds.

   reaction.  Most likely lab error.

   #  Hypoxemia:  Likely secondary to HAP (initially LLL infiltrate), now
   CXR shows ?collapsed RLL. This was most likely a result of the pt lying
   on his left side for many hours during the surgery, compounded by
   volume overload and increased pulmonary secretions. The secretions have
   continued to be greenish and concerning. Fentanyl/versed sedation
   weaned off. CO2 in low 50s, likely stable hypercapnia given smoking
   history. Successfully extubated yesterday currently on BiPAP. Pt was
   afebrile overnight, although WBC trending down now 5.1. BAL w/ H. flu

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He has been experiencing multiple medical complications since his admission to the ICU.

The patient failed a bedside swallow but passed a video swallow study, indicating that he may have difficulty swallowing. He is not on oxygen and is able to sit and walk. His platelet count is stable at 96, and his sodium level is 143.

The patient's blood pressure was elevated last night, reaching up to 180/81. He was given metoprolol IV, which resulted in a decrease in blood pressure to 151/82. This indicates hypertension, which needs to be closely monitored.

The patient also has hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 142 today. To manage this, free water through tube feeds will be decreased to 100cc/hr, and the sodium level will be rechecked in the morning.

Withdrawal, pain, and delirium are ongoing issues for the patient. He has received Valium for his CIWA and has been ranging from barely arousable to agitation. Considering alternative causes for his delirium, including hypernatremia, pain, and sundowning (agitation mostly at night), it is planned to monitor the patient closely. Morphine will be given as needed for pain, and Zyprexa may be considered if the patient remains agitated and threatening.

","The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged IM nail removal and bipolar R hip replacement. He has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. The patient has altered mental status, hypernatremia, alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired airway clearance, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired respiration/gas exchange, pain control, acidosis, hypovolemia, renal failure, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current issues include hypertension, hypernatremia, withdrawal/pain/delirium, thrombocytopenia, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, decreased urine output, and s/p hip surgery. The patient's sodium levels are within normal range. The patient's platelet count is decreasing steadily, indicating thrombocytopenia. The patient has hypoxemia likely secondary to HAP with a collapsed right lower lobe. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which is stable on the current regimen. The patient's urine output is decreasing, and there is concern for acute tubular necrosis versus pre-renal azotemia. The patient's creatinine levels are improving, indicating resolving ATN. The patient underwent hip surgery and requires follow-up with physical therapy and orthopedic recommendations.

The patient's current medications include famotidine (Pepcid), metoprolol, and other ICU medications. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man who underwent a prolonged intramedullary nail removal and bipolar reverse hip replacement. He experienced significant blood loss during the procedure and was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient developed pneumonia with left lower lobe collapse, as well as ethanol withdrawal.

The patient's current conditions include hypertension, which was managed with metoprolol IV and resulted in a decrease in blood pressure. Hypernatremia is present, with a sodium level of 142 mg/dL. The patient's fluid intake through tube feeds will be decreased to 100 cc/hr to address this issue.

Withdrawal, pain, and delirium have been observed in the patient, who has received a large amount of Valium for CIWA. Alternate causes for delirium are being considered, including hypernatremia, pain, and sundowning (agitation mostly at night). Morphine will be given as needed for pain, and Zyprexa may be considered if agitation and threatening behavior persist.

Thrombocytopenia is evident, with a platelet count decreasing steadily since admission. A low suspicion for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) or drug reaction is being considered. Most likely, a lab error is the cause. The CBC will be checked in the PM.

Hypoxemia is likely secondary to HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), initially affecting the left lower lobe."
