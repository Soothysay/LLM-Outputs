   Assesment: 71 y/o M with h/o recent right MCA CVA stroke hospital
   course c/b bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn,
   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] likely source of infection.
   Removed last night and will plan to f/up catheter tip cultures from
   line. Also recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another source
   of infection given his recent history.
   - pan cultured blood, urine, and sputum and  will f/up results
   - placed new Left Subclavian central line last night
   - Will treat with Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, will
   hold off on Zosyn given no clear infiltrate on CXR
   - con
t generous volume repletion with normal saline for hypotension
   - follow UOP>30cc/hr, CVP goal [**9-13**] given on vent
   - weaned off pressors last night , BPs improved
   - consider abdominal source if continues to spike fevers, to look for
   abscess given recent procedure
   # Respiratory failure
   Multifactorial [**1-4**] bilateral PE, possible aspiration, severe OSA
   - wean vent settings
   - place arterial line
   - treat with Vanco as above
   # CVA / new hemorrhagic bleed: patient with changes in mental status
   with increased lethargy and recent history of R MCA ischemic stroke,
   now with hemorrhage. Will get repeat CT head in a.m. to assess
   magnitude of new bleed, holding all anticoagulation for now, will
   consult with neurology regarding potential bleed vs. infectious process
   likely underlying new altered MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3856**]c 1.1cm focus in right
   temporal lobe. Given small size of bleed and fevers and hypotensive
   episodes a sepsis picture is the more likely source of patient's
   altered MS.
   # Bilateral pulmonary emboli
   Contraindicated given hemorrhagic CVA
   - will need IVC filter to be placed
   - check bilateral LENI's
   - will decide along with neurology timing to restart heparin/coumadin
   .
   #Anemia
 Hct 22.6 this a.m. , may be secondary to some duilutional
   effects given substantial IVFs. Will recheck later today and transfuse

   and crossed and consent obtained
   - nml EGD this past month,  will find out when last colonoscopy was
   when pt. less sedated
   # Hypotension
   Likely secondary to septic shock given leukocytosis and fever. Also
   need to consider recurrent pulmonary emboli

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now admitted with a hemorrhagic focus in the right temporal lobe. The patient presented with fever and hypotension, suggesting sepsis as the likely etiology. Older right internal jugular (IJ) central line placed on 6/17 was likely the source of infection, which has been removed. The patient has been placed on a new left subclavian central line. Cultures have been obtained from blood, urine, and sputum, and the results will be followed up. The patient is being treated with Vancomycin to cover for line infection and MRSA, while holding off on Zosyn given no clear infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is receiving aggressive volume repletion with normal saline for hypotension, with goals of urine output greater than 30 cc/hr and central venous pressure (CVP) between 9-13 mmHg. Pressors have been weaned off, and BPs have improved. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including bilateral pulmonary emboli, possible aspiration, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and treatment involves weaning vent settings, placing an arterial line, and treating with Vancomycin. The patient also has a new hemorrhagic bleed in the right temporal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient arrived in the ICU from OSH with a triple lumen in place, most likely placed at Hospital1 prior to discharge. The blue port was unable to flush, and the brown & white ports were flushing with minimal return. The patient was intubated in the EW and had a multi-lumen line started at 07:22 PM. An arterial line was started at 10:00 PM, and the multi-lumen line was stopped at 10:47 PM. The patient received various infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/57 to 99/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient had a CVP of 9 mmHg, and fluid balance showed a total input of 4,271 mL and output of 750 mL. The patient received respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. ABG results showed pH 7.45, PaCO2 41 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 235, and Ve of 10.5 L/min. Lab results indicated elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 22.6%, platelet count (Plt) at 331 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 0.8 mg/dL, and lactic acid at 0.7 mmol/L. Other lab values were within normal limits. The patient's condition remained unchanged, and they were on full code status. Disposition was not mentioned in the progress note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and central venous catheter-related infections. Additionally, considering the patient's elevated lactic acid level, there is a possibility of underlying sepsis or poor tissue perfusion. However, further evaluation and clinical correlation are needed to confirm these potential complications."

The patient arrived in the ICU from OSH with a triple lumen placed at Hospital1. Upon arrival, the blue port was unable to flush and both the brown and white ports were flushing with minimal return. The patient was intubated in the EW and an arterial line was started. The multi-lumen catheter was eventually removed due to issues with flushing. The patient received fluid boluses for low urine output and low CVP. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are within normal limits, except for an elevated white blood cell count. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on pressors since admission. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient arrived in the ICU with a triple lumen in place, likely placed at another hospital prior to discharge. The blue port of the multi-lumen catheter was unable to flush, while the brown and white ports flushed with minimal return. The patient was intubated in the emergency department and started on invasive ventilation. An arterial line was also started. Sputum culture was obtained, and the multi-lumen catheter was stopped. The patient has allergies to Celebrex and experienced facial/mouth swelling as a reaction. The last dose of antibiotics given was Vancomycin at 10:00 PM. The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions. Pantoprazole was administered at midnight. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/57-99/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, with total fluid input of 4,271 mL and output of 750 mL. The patient received 2,271 mL of intravenous fluids and had a blood product transfusion of 750 mL. Respiratory support includes endotr"

   course c/b bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn,
   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] likely source of infection.
   Removed last night and will plan to f/up catheter tip cultures from
   line. Also recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another source
   of infection given his recent history.
   - pan cultured blood, urine, and sputum and  will f/up results
   - placed new Left Subclavian central line last night
   - Will treat with Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, will
   hold off on Zosyn given no clear infiltrate on CXR
   - con
t generous volume repletion with normal saline for hypotension
   - follow UOP>30cc/hr, CVP goal [**9-13**] given on vent
   - weaned off pressors last night , BPs improved
   - consider abdominal source if continues to spike fevers, to look for
   abscess given recent procedure
   # Respiratory failure

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, who was admitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now presents with fever, hypotension, and sepsis as likely etiology. The patient had a hemorrhagic focus in the right temporal lobe, likely secondary to septic shock. The source of infection is suspected to be an older right internal jugular (IJ) central line, which has been removed. Other potential sources of infection include recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including bilateral pulmonary emboli, possible aspiration, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been weaned from ventilator settings and is currently doing well on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The patient has a new hemorrhagic bleed in the right temporal lobe, which is being monitored closely. Neurology consultation has been requested to assess the magnitude of the bleed and determine if it is due to an infectious process or another underlying cause. The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to sepsis rather than the hemorrhagic bleed.

The patient has contraindications for anticoagulation, so an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter will be placed. The bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now admitted with hemorrhagic focus in the right temporal lobe. The patient presented with fever and hypotension, leading to a likely diagnosis of septic shock. The source of infection is suspected to be an older right internal jugular (IJ) central line, which was removed last night. The patient also has recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, and cultures have been obtained from blood, urine, and sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to the presence of fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, and a possible central line infection. Treatment includes aggressive volume repletion with normal saline, administration of Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, and consideration of an abdominal source if fevers continue.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to bilateral pulmonary emboli, possible aspiration, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Weaning from the ventilator settings has been well overnight, and the patient is currently doing well on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10 PS/7 PEEP.
3. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA"

   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25**], MD
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), altered mental status, aspiration, hypotension, and fever. 

The patient was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. They were also given fluid resuscitation, and their central venous pressure (CVP) improved with fluids. The right internal jugular (IJ) central line was removed, and the tip was cultured. The patient was transitioned from assist-control ventilation to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and showed good oxygen saturation (SpO2) on FIO2=0.4 with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 32.

The patient's medical history includes a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), anemia, and hypertension. They have allergies to Celebrex. The patient was started on vancomycin for possible line infection, and their antibiotic regimen included pantoprazole (Protonix). They were given fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, respectively.

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) ranging from 65-94 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 72-115/46-58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 9-24 breaths per minute, and SpO2"

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treated with zosyn, and now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in the right temporal lobe and new onset fevers, hypotension, and suspected sepsis.

24-hour events:
- Repeat head CT yesterday showed no transformation from the right temporal area 1.1cm hemorrhagic focus.
- IVC filter placement with no complications.
- Started percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube feeds, which he tolerates well.
- Started bowel regimen to encourage bowel movements.
- Overnight, he had some climbing blood pressures in the 160s systolic blood pressure (SBP) range. Given home enalapril, he was also given hydralazine and diltiazem to better control blood pressure. Currently on 60mg qid diltiazem and IV hydralazine PRN with daily home enalapril dose, aiming for SBP goal of 120-140.
- Placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight and is saturating above 95% consistently on 18/8 setting, now comfortable with 94% O2 saturation on 4L NC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. On admission, he was found to have an elevated blood glucose level of 167 mg/dL and a high WBC count of 14.2 K/uL. He was started on invasive ventilation and given antibiotics (Vancomycin) for suspected sepsis. The patient underwent an ultrasound to check for the presence of clots.

24-hour events:
- The patient was intubated in the EW and invasive ventilation was stopped.
- Diltiazem and hydralazine infusions were started.
- The patient received a dose of Celebrex orally.
- The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 100.2 F, blood pressure ranging from 104-167 mmHg, heart rate between 70-106 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Flow sheet data as of [2116-7-3] 06:21 AM:
- The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.9 C (100.2 F).
- Blood pressure readings were between 92/50-167/75 mmHg.
- Heart rate was between 70-106 bpm.
- Respiratory rate varied between 10-27 breaths per minute.
- Oxygen saturation remained above 95%.
- The patient's rhythm was sinus.
- Fluid balance showed a total input of 1,631 mL and output of 2,005 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -374 mL.
- Other vital signs, lab values, and medications are documented.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged use of invasive ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients often develop stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid production.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate potential kidney dysfunction.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac history increases the risk of arrhythmias.
7. Bloodstream infection: Central lines increase the risk of bloodstream infections.
8. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers.
9. Delirium: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing delirium due to the stress of illness and the effects of sedative medications."

   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] likely source of infection.
   Removed last night and will plan to f/up catheter tip cultures from
   line. Also recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another source
   of infection given his recent history.
   - pan cultured blood, urine, and sputum and  will f/up results
   - placed new Left Subclavian central line last night
   - Will treat with Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, will
   hold off on Zosyn given no clear infiltrate on CXR
   - con
t generous volume repletion with normal saline for hypotension
   - follow UOP>30cc/hr, CVP goal [**9-13**] given on vent
   - weaned off pressors last night , BPs improved
   - consider abdominal source if continues to spike fevers, to look for
   abscess given recent procedure
   # Respiratory failure
   Multifactorial [**1-4**] bilateral PE, possible aspiration, severe OSA
   - weaned from vent settings well overnight, doing well on CPAP
   currently (10PS/7PEEP)
   - place arterial line
   - treat with Vancomycin as above
   # CVA / new hemorrhagic bleed: patient with changes in mental status
   with increased lethargy and recent history of R MCA ischemic stroke,
   now with hemorrhage. Will get repeat CT head in a.m. to assess
   magnitude of new bleed, holding all anticoagulation for now, will
   consult with neurology regarding potential bleed vs. infectious process
   likely underlying new altered MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3856**]c 1.1cm focus in right
   temporal lobe. Given small size of bleed and fevers and hypotensive
   episodes a sepsis picture is the more likely source of patient's
   altered MS.
   # Bilateral pulmonary emboli
   Contraindicated given hemorrhagic CVA
   - will need IVC filter to be placed most likely, will call IR to see
   this a.m.
   - check bilateral LENI's
   - will decide along with neurology timing to restart heparin/coumadin
   .
   #Anemia
 Hct 22.6 this a.m. , may be secondary to some duilutional
   effects given substantial IVFs. Will recheck later today and transfuse
   if  Hct < 21, guaic negative in ER, continue  check stool guaics,  type
   and crossed and consent obtained
   - nml EGD this past month,  will find out when last colonoscopy was
   when pt. less sedated
   # Hypotension
   Likely secondary to septic shock given leukocytosis and fever. Also
   need to consider recurrent pulmonary emboli
   - treat for sepsis as above
   # OSA
   - on CPAP now doing well at 10PS / 7PEEP, oxygen saturations above 96%

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. He was admitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now presents with fever, hypotension, and sepsis as likely etiology. The patient has a hemorrhagic focus in the right temporal lobe, which may be due to sepsis or an infectious process.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests septic shock, possibly caused by an infected older right internal jugular (IJ) central line. The line has been removed, and cultures will be followed up. Treatment with Vancomycin has been initiated to cover for line infection and MRSA.
2. Respiratory failure: Multifactorial causes such as bilateral pulmonary emboli, possible aspiration, and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contribute to the patient's respiratory failure. The patient has been weaned from mechanical ventilation and is currently doing well on CPAP.
3. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/new hemorrhagic bleed: The patient has changes in mental status with increased lethargy and a recent history of right MCA ischemic stroke. Now, there is evidence of a new hemorrhage. A repeat CT head will be done to assess the magnitude of the bleed. All anticoagulation will be held, and neurology will be consulted regarding the potential"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Assessment and Plan:
   Assesment: 71 y/o M with h/o recent right MCA CVA stroke hospital
   course c/b bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn,
   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] likely source of infection.
   Removed last night and will plan to f/up catheter tip cultures from
   line. Also recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another source
   of infection given his recent history.
   - pan cultured blood, urine, and sputum and  will f/up results
   - placed new Left Subclavian central line last night
   - Will treat with Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, will
   hold off on Zosyn given no clear infiltrate on CXR
   - con
t generous volume repletion with normal saline for hypotension
   - follow UOP>30cc/hr, CVP goal [**9-13**] given on vent
   - weaned off pressors last night , BPs improved
   - consider abdominal source if continues to spike fevers, to look for
   abscess given recent procedure
   # Respiratory failure
   Multifactorial [**1-4**] bilateral PE, possible aspiration, severe OSA
   - weaned from vent settings well overnight, doing well on CPAP
   currently (10PS/7PEEP)
   - place arterial line
   - treat with Vancomycin as above
   # CVA / new hemorrhagic bleed: patient with changes in mental status
   with increased lethargy and recent history of R MCA ischemic stroke,
   now with hemorrhage. Will get repeat CT head in a.m. to assess
   magnitude of new bleed, holding all anticoagulation for now, will
   consult with neurology regarding potential bleed vs. infectious process
   likely underlying new altered MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3856**]c 1.1cm focus in right
   temporal lobe. Given small size of bleed and fevers and hypotensive
   episodes a sepsis picture is the more likely source of patient's
   altered MS.
   # Bilateral pulmonary emboli
   Contraindicated given hemorrhagic CVA
   - will need IVC filter to be placed most likely, will call IR to see
   this a.m.
   - check bilateral LENI's
   - will decide along with neurology timing to restart heparin/coumadin
   .
   #Anemia
 Hct 22.6 this a.m. , may be secondary to some duilutional
   effects given substantial IVFs. Will recheck later today and transfuse
   if  Hct < 21, guaic negative in ER, continue  check stool guaics,  type
   and crossed and consent obtained
   - nml EGD this past month,  will find out when last colonoscopy was
   when pt. less sedated
   # Hypotension
   Likely secondary to septic shock given leukocytosis and fever. Also
   need to consider recurrent pulmonary emboli
   - treat for sepsis as above
   # OSA
   - on CPAP now doing well at 10PS / 7PEEP, oxygen saturations above 96%

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology. He was treated with vancomycin, placed on a new left subclavian central line, and is being conservative with volume repletion using normal saline for hypotension.

The patient also has respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including bilateral PE, possible aspiration, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was weaned from ventilator settings well overnight and is currently doing well on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) at 10 PS (positive end-expiratory pressure) and 7 PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure).

Additionally, the patient has a new hemorrhagic bleed in the right temporal lobe. A repeat CT head is planned in the morning to assess the magnitude of the bleed. All anticoagulation is being held, and neurology consultation is being sought regarding potential bleed versus infectious process likely underlying new altered mental status (MS).

Furthermore, the patient has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 22.6 this morning, which may be secondary to dilutional effects due to substantial intravenous fluids (IVFs). It is planned to recheck"

","The patient is a 72-inch tall male with an unknown weight who is admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. He has been experiencing a fever of 102.5°F and evidence of a new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient also had hypotension, which was treated with a normal saline bolus. He was given cefepime, flagyl, and vancomycin to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia due to poor gag reflex and aspiration risks. The patient had some fleeting, non-sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, but it resolved without any medical intervention. He is currently on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation levels between 92-97% on 2L NC. The patient is unable to tolerate CPAP as he is aspirating more oral secretions. A cough peak flow (CPT) was performed twice with fair results, and the patient is able to cough to the back of his throat, requiring yankauer suctioning. A possible need for a formal swallow study is being evaluated to assess management of oral secretions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 71 y/o M with h/o recent right MCA CVA stroke hospital
   course c/b bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn,
   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] have been likely source
   of infection, catheter tip culture s/p removal is pending.  Also
   recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another likely source of
   infection given his impaired gag reflex s/p CVA and  recent history of
   PNAs.
   - urine Cx negative , willl f/up results blood cx, catheter tip cx
   - placed new Left Subclavian central line [**7-1**]
   - Will treat with Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, will
   hold off on Zosyn given no clear infiltrate on CXR
   - con
t generous volume repletion with normal saline if BP drops again,
   appears resolved now
   - follow UOP>30cc/hr, CVP goal [**6-10**]
   -new fevers today of 102s, reculture and follow, some eosinophilia on
   differential today so will check galactomannon & glucan, will encourage
   spirometry also as atelectasis noted on CXRs
   # Respiratory failure
 resolved, still some residual beaseline SOB
   likely [**1-4**] bilateral PE, severe OSA history so we will con
t nightly
   CPAP and daytime NC with low flow oxygen 4-8L PRN for Oxygen sat goal
   in mid-90s.  Con
t Vanco coverage for MRSA risks PNA, recent HAP
   # CVA / new hemorrhagic bleed: patient with changes in mental status on
   admission with increased lethargy and recent history of R MCA ischemic
   stroke, which transformed to hemorrhagic focus, 1.1cm at right temporal
   lobe. Repeat CT head last night showing no aadditional spread or
   evolution of new bleed.  Will holding all anticoagulation for now per
   neurology recs, IVC now in place.
   # Bilateral pulmonary emboli
   Anticoagulation being held given hemorrhagic CVA now,  IVC filter
   placed yesturday without complications.  Bilateral LENI's revealing a
   right peroneal DVT. Will discuss further benefit vs. risk of
   restarting any future heparin/coumadin with neurology
   #Right wrist pain
 will obtain right wrist XR, call OT/PT to get a
   splint and remove a-line at area which may also be causing patient
   discomfort.
   #Anemia
 Hct trend improving from 22.6 yesturday to 24.1 this a.m. ,
   will follow Hct trend overnight and hold off transfusions for now.
   Drop may be secondary to some duilutional effects given substantial
   IVFs on admission. Will recheck p.m. or tomorrow and transfuse if  Hct
   < 25.  History of  guaic negative stool  in ER and in ICU .  Type and
   crossed and consent obtained.  Also of note,  pt. had  a normal  EGD
   this past month.
   # HTN --- patient
s hypotension has resolved, and now conversely had
   issues overnight with HTN which was controlled with Diltiazem and
   Enalapril, will con
t Hydralazine PRN with goal SBP between 120-140
   range.
   # OSA
   - on CPAP overnight ,  set at 18PS/ 8 PEEP last night, oxygen
   saturations above 96% consistently, will continue nightly
   .
   # FEN:  Will continue PEG feeds for now with Nutrien, replete

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now admitted with hemorrhagic focus in the right temporal lobe and fever and hypotension suggestive of sepsis.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Septic shock: The patient is suspected to have sepsis as evidenced by fever and hypotension. The likely source of infection is an older right internal jugular (IJ) central line, which was removed. Another potential source could be recurrent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis due to impaired gag reflex after the CVA. Cultures from urine, blood, and catheter tip are pending.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient had resolved respiratory failure but still experiences residual baseline shortness of breath (SOB). He has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be used nightly, and the patient will continue to receive low flow oxygen through a nasal cannula.

3. CVA/Hemorrhagic bleed: The patient has changes in mental status on admission and a recent history of right MCA ischemic stroke, which transformed into a hemorrhagic focus in the right temporal lobe. Repeat CT head showed no additional spread or evolution of new bleed. Antico"

    71 y/o M with h/o recent right MCA CVA stroke hospital course c/b
   bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn, admitted to
   ICU now w/ hemorrhagic CVA, fevers and  hypotension with sepsis
   suspected.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had evidence of new RLL infiltrate on CXR and fever 102.5 F
   around 1-2pm yesturday.  Overnight he also had hypotension with SBPs in
   80-90s range and was given 500cc NS bolus to bring up BP.  Cefipime and
   Flagyl added to his Vanco regimen to cover for HAP given poor gag
   reflex and aspiration risks. He has some fleeting, non-sustained SVT
   10-20 beats x2 overnight which resolved and did not need any other [**Hospital **]
   medical management.
   He is on nasal cannula with O2 sats 92-97% on 2L NC .  No CPAP tonight
   as he seems to be aspirating more oral secretions with device.  CPT
   done x 2 with fair results, able to cough to back of throat requiring
   yankuer suctioning.  Possible need for formal swallow study to evaluate
   management of oral secretions

   course c/b bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn,
   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] have been likely source
   of infection, final catheter tip culture s/p removal is pending,
   negative growth to date.  Given impaired gag response recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another likely source of infection,
   especially given focal infiltrate on recent CXR RLL area  and  recent
   history of PNAs.

   to eosinophilia on differential [**7-3**] will check galactomannon & glucan,
   will encourage spirometry/Chest PT  also as atelectasis noted on CXRs
   # Cardiac arrhythmias /HTN
 had SVT last night for [**9-21**] second runs
   x2, had brief run of V-tach this a.m. which resolved in less than
   30secs. Patient without acute clinical symptoms during all episodes,
   comfortable, no SOB, no chest pains.  Will f/up with cardiology consult
   and will adjust cardiac medications to discontinue enalapril and
   Diltiazem and will plan to start IV Captopril for rate control /HTN
   control with goal SBP between 120-140 range
   # Respiratory failure
 resolved,  severe OSA history further
   complicates picture, holding nightly CPAP for now as patient appears to
   aspirate much more with mask in place. Will  maintain on NC with low
   flow oxygen 2-4L for Oxygen sat goal in mid-90s today and through night
   for now.  Con
t Vanco/Cefipime/Flagyl coverage for MRSA risks,
   suspected PNA, recent HAP hx
   # CVA / new hemorrhagic bleed: mental status changes improved from
   admission, decreased lethargy. Recent history of R MCA ischemic stroke,
   which transformed to hemorrhagic focus, 1.1cm at right temporal lobe.
   Repeat CT head [**7-2**] showing no additional spread or evolution of new
   bleed.  Will holding all anticoagulation for now per neurology recs,
   IVC now in place.  Will discuss long term anticoag advice with neuro
   team.
   # Bilateral pulmonary emboli
   Anticoagulation being held given hemorrhagic CVA ,  IVC filter  placed

   peroneal DVT.  As above, will discuss further benefit vs. risk of
   restarting any future heparin/coumadin with neurology
   #Right wrist pain
 will follow-up final right wrist XR, call OT/PT to
   get a splint and remove a-line at area which may also be causing
   patient discomfort.

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and now admitted with hemorrhagic CVA, fevers, and hypotension suspected to be sepsis.

24-hour events:
- The patient had evidence of new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and fever around 1-2 pm yesterday.
- Overnight, the patient experienced hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 80-90s range and was given a 500cc normal saline bolus to bring up the blood pressure.
- Cefipime and Flagyl were added to the Vancomycin regimen to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to the patient's poor gag reflex and aspiration risks.
- The patient had some fleeting, nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) for 10-20 beats twice overnight, which resolved without any intervention.
- The patient is on nasal cannula with oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 92-97% on 2 liters per minute (L/min) nasal cannula. No continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was administered overnight as the patient seemed to be aspirating more oral secretions with the mask.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there have been several significant events in the past 24 hours. The patient's lipid profile was sent, and the cardiology team advised trying to keep the potassium above 4.5. An echo is planned, and a TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) is still pending.

The patient received 1 unit of blood yesterday, which improved their Hct (hematocrit) from 23 to 24.9, and now it is at 25.3. The patient experienced a brief run of V-tach (ventricular tachycardia) that lasted less than a minute without any associated symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. No additional arrhythmias were observed overnight, except for occasional PVCs (premature ventricular contractions). The patient is now on Captopril PO for hypertension and rate control, while enalapril and Diltiazem were discontinued yesterday. SBPs (systolic blood pressures) have been in the range of 130-140 overnight. The patient is still awaiting PICC (peripheral inserted central catheter) placement, which is likely to take place on Monday. Additionally, the patient had a guaiac positive stool yesterday, indicating the presence of occult blood, although there was no hematochezia or bright red blood per rectum noted."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), who has been hospitalized for bilateral pulmonary emboli and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition includes hemorrhagic CVA, fevers, and hypotension with suspected sepsis. 

Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic CVA: The patient has developed a hemorrhagic stroke, which is a type of bleeding in the brain. This can lead to neurological deficits, increased intracranial pressure, and potential deterioration in consciousness.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.

3. VAP: The patient has a history of ventilator-associated pneumonia, indicating an infection acquired while on mechanical ventilation. This can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of further complications.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low (370 K/uL), indicating thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding, especially considering the patient's hemorrhagic CVA.

5. Abnormal Lipid Profile: The patient's lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, which may contribute to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical complications. The note details the patient's health progress over time, including changes in medication, vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.

Some potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient experienced a brief run of V-tach and occasional PVCs. These arrhythmias can be concerning and may require further evaluation and management.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the range of 130-140 mmHg, which is higher than the normal range. This could indicate hypertension or may be a result of the medications being administered.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 370 K/uL, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is low at 3.6 mEq/L, indicating hypokalemia. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL, indicating anemia. This can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.8 mg/dL, suggesting impaired kidney function. This can lead"

   24 Hour Events:
   Cardiology consulted yesturday and patient had lipid profile sent and
   team advised to try to keep potassium above 4.5, will plan to get
   echo,  still has TTE pending.
   Hct improved from 23
 24.9 after 1 Unit blood yesturday, now Hct 25.3.
   He had a brief run of V-tach yesturday afternoon that lasted less than
   a minute with no associated CP, SOB.  He had no additional arrhythmias
   overnight other than occasional PVCs.  Patient is now on Captopril PO
   for HTN and rate control, enalapril and Diltiazem discontinued
   yesturday.  SBPs in 130-140 range overnight.  He is still awaiting PICC
   placement which will likely take place Monday.  He also had a guiac
   positive stool yesturday, no hematochezia or BRBPR per R.N.  just a
   dark formed stool, occult blood noted.
   He is breathing regularly on 2L NC with oxygen sats 92-100% overnight.
   No CPAP last night  as he seems to be aspirating more oral secretions
   with the CPAP device.  Chest PT continues  with fair results, coughing
   up sputum and getting oral suctioning.

   course c/b bilateral pulmonary emboli, VAP s/p treatment with zosyn,
   now admitted with hemorrhagic 1.1cm focus in right temporal lobe and
   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] have been likely source
   of infection, final catheter tip culture s/p removal is pending,
   negative growth to date.  Given impaired gag response recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another likely source of infection,
   especially given focal infiltrate on recent CXR RLL area  and  recent
   history of PNAs.
   - urine Cx negative ,  blood cx, urine cx and catheter tip cx
   negative to date, will follow pending blood cx
   - placed new Left Subclavian central line [**7-1**]
   - Will treat with Vancomycin to cover for line infection MRSA, added
   Cefipime and flagyl coverage given newer  RLL infiltrate on CXR [**7-3**]
   - con
t generous volume repletion with normal saline if BP drops again,
   appears resolved now
   - follow UOP>30cc/hr, CVP goal [**6-10**]
   -con
t to have fevers 102s, recultured, will f/up cx results and  due
   to eosinophilia on differential [**7-3**] will f/up pending galactomannon &
   glucan
   # Cardiac arrhythmias /HTN
 had brief V-tach run  on [**7-3**] for less
   than 30secs episode, and NSVT  for [**9-21**] second runs x2 the night prior
   but no episodes overnight from [**Date range (1) 3901**], a few PVCs noted overnight.
   Patient without acute clinical symptoms during all episodes,
   comfortable, no SOB, no chest pains.  EKGs showing no new changes.
   Cardiology consult [**7-4**] advised lipid profile f/up, and ECHO which will
   likely be done Monday [**7-6**]. Also,  cardiac medications adjusted as we
   discontinued enalapril and Diltiazem and  started PO Captopril
   alongside Lopressor PO for rate control /HTN control with goal SBP
   between 120-140 range
   # Respiratory failure
 resolved,  severe OSA history further
   complicates picture, holding nightly CPAP for now as patient appears to
   aspirate much more with mask in place. Will  maintain on NC with low
   flow oxygen 2-4L for Oxygen sat goal in mid-90s today and through night
   for now.  Con
t Vanco/Cefipime/Flagyl coverage for MRSA risks,
   suspected PNA, recent HAP hx  ,
   will encourage spirometry/Chest PT also as atelectasis noted on CXRs,
   checking daily CXRs
   # CVA / new hemorrhagic bleed: mental status changes improved from
   admission, decreased lethargy. Recent history of R MCA ischemic stroke,
   which transformed to hemorrhagic focus, 1.1cm at right temporal lobe.
   Repeat CT head [**7-2**] showing no additional spread or evolution of new
   bleed.  Will holding all anticoagulation for now per neurology recs,
   IVC now in place.  Will discuss long term anticoag advice with neuro
   team.
   # Bilateral pulmonary emboli
   Anticoagulation being held given hemorrhagic CVA ,  IVC filter  placed
   [**7-2**] without complications.  Bilateral LENI's revealing a right
   peroneal DVT.  As above, will discuss further benefit vs. risk of
   restarting any future heparin/coumadin with neurology once patient
   stabilizes
   #Right wrist pain
 right wrist XR shows no fractures, called OT/PT and
   pt. fitted with splint,  a-line removed, x-ray c/w possible arthritic
   changes and has some local swelling at area which may also be causing
   patient discomfort. Will con
t monitor and Tylenol PRN for pain control
   #Anemia
patient got 1 Unit blood yesturday and Hct up to 25 range now
   after recent low Hct trend in 23-24 range for few days. Given new
   cardiac changes will watch Hct trend [**Hospital1 **].  Initial drop may have been
   secondary to some duilutional effects given substantial IVFs on
   admission. Last night had positive occult guaic of stool, no gross
   hematochezia or melena noted.  Type and crossed and consent obtained
   already.  Also of note,  pt. had  a normal  EGD this past month. New
   positive guiac and HCt trend warrant colonoscopy at future date and
   possible workup for underlying malignancy.
   # OSA
 holding  CPAP overnight  as aspirates actively w/mask,  oxygen
   saturations above 96% consistently, will continue nightly NC with low
   flow O2 2-4L
   .
   # FEN:  Will continue PEG feeds for now with Nutrien, replete
   electrolytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 142/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 21 mmHg, and their fluid balance over the past 24 hours is 3,797 mL total input and 1,500 mL total output, with a net fluid gain of 2,297 mL. The patient is receiving multiple intravenous medications, including antibiotics, and is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their skin, neurologic status, and other physical exam findings are also not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.9-14.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 22.6-25.3 %, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 370 K/uL. Renal function tests show normal creatinine (Cr) levels at 0.6-0.8 mg/dL. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin-T and CK-MB are within normal limits. Other lab results, such as electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal ranges or do not show significant abnormalities."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), bilateral pulmonary emboli, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hemorrhagic CVA. The patient has been treated with zosyn and admitted to the ICU. Currently, the patient presents with fevers and hypotension, suggesting suspected sepsis. 

Overnight, the patient's condition improved with a Hct level increasing from 23.6 to 25.3. The patient experienced a brief run of ventricular tachycardia but remained hemodynamically stable. Blood pressure readings were in the range of 130-140 mmHg overnight. The patient's oxygen saturation remained between 92-100% on 2L NC with oxygen. No CPAP was administered last night due to increased oral secretions. Chest physiotherapy was performed, and the patient was coughing up sputum and receiving oral suctioning. 

The patient's right arterial line was discontinued, and a wrist x-ray revealed no fractures but showed soft tissue swelling and chondrocalcification markings. The patient has a history of allergies to Celebrex, facial/mouth swelling, and a last dose of antibiotics taken on 07/03/2116. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/61 to 147/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 25.3%, platelet count of 370 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 16 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 32 mEq/L, blood glucose of 113 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination revealed a pale complexion, right-sided neglect, and left-sided hemiparesis. The patient's chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or effusion. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's general appearance is pale with no acute distress, more alert today, and noted gaze to the right with left neglect during interactions. The patient's HEENT exam revealed right neglect with gaze abating at midline, PERRL, sclera anicteric, no epistaxis, and no murmurs or rubs noted. The patient's neck exam showed a JVP of approximately 6 cm, 2+ carotid up"

   fever and hypotension with sepsis as likely etiology
   .
   # Septic shock :
   Older right IJ central line placed on [**6-17**] have been likely source
   of infection, final catheter tip culture s/p removal is pending,
   negative growth to date.  Given impaired gag response recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is another likely source of infection,
   especially given focal infiltrate on recent CXR RLL area  and  recent
   history of PNAs.

   30secs. Patient without acute clinical symptoms during all episodes,
   comfortable, no SOB, no chest pains.  Will f/up with cardiology consult
   and will adjust cardiac medications to discontinue enalapril and
   Diltiazem and will plan to start IV Captopril for rate control /HTN
   control with goal SBP between 120-140 range

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of recent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, hospital course complicated by bilateral pulmonary emboli and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was treated with zosyn and admitted to the ICU. Currently, the patient presents with hemorrhagic cerebral vascular accident (CVA), fevers, and hypotension suspected to be sepsis.

24-Hour Events:
- Cardiology consulted yesterday and recommended trying to keep potassium above 4.5. An echocardiogram will be planned, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is still pending.
- Hematocrit (Hct) improved from 23.0 to 24.9 after receiving 1 Unit of blood yesterday, and it is now 25.3.
- The patient had a brief run of ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) yesterday afternoon that lasted less than a minute without associated chest pain or shortness of breath. There have been no additional arrhythmias overnight except for occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
- The patient is now on captopril PO for hypertension and rate control, while enalapril and diltiazem were discontinued yesterday.
- Blood pressures have been in the range of 130-140 mmHg overnight.
- The patient is still awaiting placement of a percutaneous central venous cath"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a known cerebrovascular accident (cva), hemorrhagic conversion, bilateral pulmonary embolisms (pe), deep vein thrombosis (dvt), and likely aspiration pneumonia (pna). The patient has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently stable with improved oxygenation and no fever. Neurological exam remains unchanged after a repeat head CT showing stable hemorrhagic transformation. The decision to resume anticoagulation for known clots needs to be made in the next several days after detailed discussion with neurology. For now, anticoagulation will be held off, and pneumoboot on left lower extremity (LLE) will continue for dvt prophylaxis. The patient's wrist pain has improved, and an arterial line was discontinued. The patient should be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic conversion of the cva: The patient already has hemorrhagic conversion, which indicates bleeding into the brain tissue after a stroke. This condition can worsen and lead to further neurological complications.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient likely has aspiration pneumonia due to his history of aspiration. If not properly treated, it can progress and cause respiratory distress or systemic infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The patient has an existing dvt and bilateral pe. If anticoagulation is not properly managed, there is a risk of"
