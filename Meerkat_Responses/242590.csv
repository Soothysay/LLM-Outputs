   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old man with HTN, HL, DM, CKD, non-verbal from schitzophrenia
   and mental retardation presenting with NSTEMI and hyperglycemia.
   # NSTEMI:  EKG and cardiac enzymes consitent with NSTEMI.  He is not
   consentable for cardiac catheterization, but presumably full code.  We
   will medically manage for now.  He does not appear to have signs of
   cardiogenic shock, but will be gentle with beta-blockade for concern of
   worsening heart failure.
   - continue ASA, plavix, statin, ACE, heparin gtt x 48 hours
   - low-dose beta-blocker for HR goal < 90
   - make all attempts to reach guardian today
   - social work consult
   - ethics consultation.
   #Hemineglect: Check CT head today.
   #Distended bowel on CXR: continue to follow clinically.
   #Hematuria
 continue continuous bladder irrigation.
   # HYPOXEMIA: Likely secondary to fluid overload from MI, but patient
   does not appear to be in cardiogenic shock.
   - diuresis with lasix as needed to treat hypoxia, responded well to 10
   mg IV.
   - repeat cxr if not improving
   # HYPERTENSION:  Unclear if well controlled on home regimen, but
   current hypertension is contributing to demand.
   - Nitroglycerin gtt
   - add valsartan
   - beta blocker
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA: Likely precipitated by NSTEMI on top of diabetes.
   - restart home regimen and start insulin gtt if not controlled
   - check A1c to evaluate control at home
   - hold sulfonurea
   #Leucocytosis: also likely MI related, will trend WBC daily.
   # SCHITZOPHRENIA: Unable to determine home zyprexa dose after
   contacting psychiatrist, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] residence.  Will continue to try to
   track down info.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hyperglycemia. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, ACE inhibitors, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has some concerning symptoms such as possible left hemineglect, hypoxemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, leucocytosis, and schizotypal behavior.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemineglect: This refers to a neurological condition where the patient may not be aware of one side of their body or neglect to move it. It could be a result of a stroke or other brain injury. The patient's CT head should be checked today to further evaluate this condition.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels might be secondary to fluid overload from the myocardial infarction (MI). Diuretics like Lasix can be used to treat hypoxia, and a repeat chest X-ray should be done if there is no improvement.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure is contributing to increased demand. Nitroglycerin, valsartan, and beta-blockers can be used to manage"

He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hyperglycemia. The patient is not consentable for cardiac catheterization but will be managed medically. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/65 mmHg to 167/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has an EKG consistent with NSTEMI and elevated cardiac enzymes. He is on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, ACE inhibitor, heparin, and low-dose beta-blocker. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to ongoing myocardial ischemia.
2. Worsening heart failure as a result of the NSTEMI.
3. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.
4. Nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia) due to prolonged intubation and ventilation.
5. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of corticosteroids.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. Hyperglycemic crisis or diabetic ketoacidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old man with HTN, HL, DM, CKD, non-verbal from schitzophrenia
   and mental retardation presenting with NSTEMI and hyperglycemia.
   # Subacute Stroke:
   Large hypodense area on CT in Right occipital lobe, likely
   cardioembolic stroke.  Neurology consulted and prefers not to use
   heparin gtt though states that it is OK if absolutely necessary for
   ACS.   Patient appears to have some visual defects in Left eye; does
   not appear to have left-sided hemineglect.  Neuro exam limited due to
   patient
s schizophrenia and difficulty participating in exam.
   -          Repeat Head CT if neuro exam changes
   -          Restarting heparin gtt for now
   # NSTEMI:
   EKG and cardiac enzymes consitent with NSTEMI on presentation.
   Difficult to assess patient in terms of pain, so checked EKG last night
   which showed larger T wave inversions, similar to on presentation;
   concern for restarting heparin gtt for coronary reperfusion, medical
   management of NSTEMI.  Cardiac enzymes trending down, so heparin gtt
   not restarted.  He is not consentable for cardiac catheterization, but
   presumably full code.   He does not appear to have signs of cardiogenic
   shock, but will be gentle with beta-blockade for concern of worsening
   heart failure.  Social work involved and found guardian
s phone number;
   message left for guardian by social worker and CCU team.
   - continue ASA, plavix, statin, ACE
   - low-dose beta-blocker for HR goal < 90
   - contact guardian
   - appreciate social work help
   - appreciate ethics recommendations
   # HYPOXEMIA:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to fluid overload from MI.  Less likely to have PE b/c
   no signs of RH strain on EKG or Echo, though still possible.  Attempted
   diuresis with lasix overnight, responded moderately well w urine
   output; difficult to assess whether oxygenation improved because he was
   on more O2 than required.  Oxygenation worsens with agitation.
   -          diurese a little further, with care that patient likely
   somewhat preload dependent in setting of significant
   akinesis/hypokinesis
   -          repeat cxr if not improving
   -          on heparin gtt now which will help for possible PE as well
   # HYPERTENSION:
   Weaned of nitroglycerin gtt yesterday and BPs stable on valsartan and
   beta blocker.
   - continue valsartan ; will discuss with Neuro with regards to BP
   autoregulation
   - beta blocker
   # UTI:
   Not using ciprofloxacin b/c getting antipsychotics as well which could
   prolong QT.
   - started Ceftriaxone last night
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA: Likely precipitated by NSTEMI and UTI on top of
   diabetes.
   - F/U HbA1c.
   - insulin sliding scale
   #Distended bowel on CXR: continue to follow clinically.
   #Hematuria
 Discontinue continuous bladder irrigation.
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA:
   Unclear if home zyprexa dose is accurate.  Will continue to try to
   confirm information; PCP will be in office today.
   - zyprexa 5mg daily for now

","The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hyperglycemia, and was found to have a large hypodense area on CT scan in the right occipital lobe, consistent with a subacute stroke likely due to cardioembolism. Neurology prefers not to use heparin gtt but states it is okay if absolutely necessary for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has visual defects in the left eye but does not neglect the left side. He also has some abnormalities on the EKG, including T-wave inversions, which are consistent with NSTEMI. The cardiac enzymes are trending down, so heparin gtt was not restarted. However, there is concern for restarting heparin gtt for coronary reperfusion and medical management of NSTEMI. The patient is not consentable for cardiac catheterization but is presumed to be a full code. He does not appear to have signs of cardiogenic shock but will be gentle with beta-blockade for concern of worsening heart failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 137/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Subacute stroke: The patient has a large hypodense area on CT in the right occipital lobe, likely cardioembolic stroke. This increases the risk of further neurological complications and potential worsening of existing deficits.

2. NSTEMI (Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction): The patient's EKG and cardiac enzymes are consistent with NSTEMI on presentation. Although cardiac enzymes are trending down, there is still a concern for coronary reperfusion and medical management of NSTEMI. The patient's condition may deteriorate if there is a recurrence of chest pain or worsening of cardiac function.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygenation worsens with agitation. The cause of hypoxemia is secondary to fluid overload from MI. There is a possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE), but signs of right heart strain on EKG or Echo are absent. Diuretics have been attempted, but further diuresis should be done with care considering the patient's preload dependency due to significant akinesis/hypokinesis. Repeating a chest X-ray if not improving and continuing heparin gtt for possible PE as well is recommended.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable on valsartan and beta-blocker. Continuing valsartan and discussing with Neuro regarding BP autoregulation is advised.

5. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient's urine culture is positive, and antibiotics have been started. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, likely precipitated by NSTEMI and UTI on top of diabetes. Monitoring HbA1c and using insulin sliding scale for glycemic control is recommended.

7. Distended bowel on CXR: This should be followed clinically to rule out any underlying gastrointestinal issues.

8. Hematuria: The cause of hematuria needs further investigation. Discontinuing continuous bladder irrigation may be considered.

9. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia management needs confirmation of accurate home zyprexa dose. Continuing zyprexa 5mg daily for now is advised.

10. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is stable so far. Continuing to trend creatinine levels is recommended.

Overall, this patient requires close monitoring for potential complications related to stroke, heart disease, infection, diabetes, and other comorbidities."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. He underwent a three-way foley catheter placement for continuous bladder irrigation, which resulted in the removal of clots and clear urine. A CT scan was performed, and the patient received versed and zyprexa due to somnolence and mental status changes. The neurologist suspects a large posterior infarct. The patient's urine analysis showed positive results, prompting the start of ceftriaxone. He also experienced episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and ectopy. The patient requested removal of restraints, became agitated, and was given zyprexa-zydis. His urine output decreased, and he is being monitored closely. An EKG revealed worsening T-wave inversions (TWIs), similar to the initial presentation, but cardiac enzymes remained within normal limits. Heparin sodium infusion was held, and subcutaneous heparin was started instead. The patient's cardiac enzymes will be rechecked at midnight. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. He received IV lasix for hypoxia, which resulted in a significant output of urine. The patient has a history of review of systems unchanged from admission, except for the recent events. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old man with HTN, HL, DM, CKD, non-verbal from schitzophrenia
   and mental retardation presenting with NSTEMI and hyperglycemia.
   # Subacute Stroke:
   Large hypodense area on CT in Right occipital lobe.  Neurology
   consulted and prefers not to use heparin gtt though states that it is
   OK if absolutely necessary for ACS.   Patient appears to have some
   visual defects in Left eye; does not appear to have left-sided
   hemineglect.  Neuro exam limited due to patient
s schizophrenia and
   difficulty participating in exam.
   -          Repeat Head CT if neuro exam changes
   -          Holding heparin gtt for now
   # NSTEMI:
   EKG and cardiac enzymes consitent with NSTEMI on presentation.
   Difficult to assess patient in terms of pain, so checked EKG last night
   which showed larger T wave inversions, similar to on presentation;
   concern for restarting heparin gtt for coronary reperfusion, medical
   management of NSTEMI.  Cardiac enzymes trending down, so heparin gtt
   not restarted.  He is not consentable for cardiac catheterization, but
   presumably full code.   He does not appear to have signs of cardiogenic
   shock, but will be gentle with beta-blockade for concern of worsening
   heart failure.  Social work involved and found guardian
s phone number;
   message left for guardian by social worker and CCU team.
   - continue ASA, plavix, statin, ACE
   - low-dose beta-blocker for HR goal < 90
   - make all attempts to reach guardian again today
   - appreciate social work help in contacting guardian
   - appreciate ethics recommendations
   # HYPOXEMIA:   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to fluid overload from MI.  Less likely
   to have PE b/c no signs of RH strain on EKG or Echo.  Attempted
   diuresis with lasix overnight, responded moderately well w urine
   output; difficult to assess whether oxygenation improved because he was
   on more O2 than required.  Oxygenation worsens with agitation.
   -          repeat cxr if not improving
   # HYPERTENSION:
   Weaned of nitroglycerin gtt yesterday and BPs stable on valsartan and
   beta blocker.
   - continue valsartan
   - beta blocker
   # UTI:
   Not using ciprofloxacin b/c getting antipsychotics as well which could
   prolong QT.
   - started Ceftriaxone last night
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA: Likely precipitated by NSTEMI and UTI on top of
   diabetes.
   - F/U HbA1c.
   - restart home regimen and start insulin gtt if not controlled
   - hold sulfonurea
   #Distended bowel on CXR: continue to follow clinically.
   #Hematuria
 continue continuous bladder irrigation.
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA:
   Unclear if home zyprexa dose is accurate.  Will continue to try to
   confirm information; PCP will be in office today.
   - zyprexa 5mg daily for now
   # CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: at baseline Cr 1.8-2.0

","Summary:
- The patient is a 72-year-old man with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and schizophrenia.
- He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hyperglycemia, and an undetermined subacute right occipital lobe infarct on head CT.
- The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI), eosinophils negative, and was started on ceftriaxone.
- He also had hypoxemia, which was initially treated with oxygen and lasix.
- His blood pressure is stable on valsartan and a beta-blocker.
- The patient's mental status is fluctuating, with delirium and waxing and waning mental status.
- He is on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and antipsychotics.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine levels of 1.8-2.0.
- He is currently in the critical care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient has an undetermined subacute right occipital lobe infarct, indicating a potential stroke. Monitoring for any neurological changes and repeat head CT if neuro exam changes.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac enzymes are consistent with NSTEMI. Continuing medical management of NSTEMI, monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old man with HTN, HL, DM, CKD, non-verbal from schitzophrenia
   and mental retardation presenting with NSTEMI and hyperglycemia.
   # Subacute Stroke:
   Large hypodense area on CT in Right occipital lobe, likely
   cardioembolic stroke.  Neurology consulted and prefers not to use
   heparin gtt though states that it is OK if absolutely necessary for
   ACS.   Patient appears to have some visual defects in Left eye; does
   not appear to have left-sided hemineglect.  Neuro exam limited due to
   patient
s schizophrenia and difficulty participating in exam.  Likely
   what happened is that patient had an apical clot that embolized to the
   brain.
   -          Repeat Head CT if neuro exam changes
   -          heparin gtt for now
   # NSTEMI:
   EKG and cardiac enzymes consitent with NSTEMI on presentation.
   Difficult to assess patient in terms of pain, so checked EKG last night
   which showed larger T wave inversions, similar to on presentation;
   concern for restarting heparin gtt for coronary reperfusion, medical
   management of NSTEMI.  Cardiac enzymes trending down, so heparin gtt
   not restarted.  He is not consentable for cardiac catheterization, but
   presumably full code.   He does not appear to have signs of cardiogenic
   shock, but will be gentle with beta-blockade for concern of worsening
   heart failure.  Social work involved and found guardian
s phone number;
   message left for guardian by social worker and CCU team.  Guardian has
   been [**Name (NI) 167**], agrees with current management.
   - continue ASA, plavix, statin, ACE for medical management of NSTEMI
   - low-dose beta-blocker for HR goal < 90
   - warfarin for apical akinesis.
   # HYPOXEMIA:
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to fluid overload from MI.  Less likely to have PE b/c
   no signs of RH strain on EKG or Echo, though still possible.  Attempted
   diuresis with lasix overnight, responded moderately well w urine
   output; difficult to assess whether oxygenation improved because he was
   on more O2 than required.  Oxygenation worsens with agitation.
   -          Continue with lasix 20mg PO daily.
   -          on heparin gtt now which will help for possible PE as well
   # HYPERTENSION:
   Weaned of nitroglycerin gtt yesterday and BPs stable on valsartan and
   beta blocker.
   - continue valsartan ; will discuss with Neuro with regards to BP
   autoregulation
   - beta blocker
   # UTI:
   Not using ciprofloxacin b/c getting antipsychotics as well which could
   prolong QT.
   - switched to cefpodoxime, day 3
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA: Likely precipitated by NSTEMI and UTI on top of
   diabetes.
   - hgba1c 8.1
   - insulin sliding scale
   #Distended bowel on CXR: continue to follow clinically.
   #Hematuria
 Resolved
   # SCHIZOPHRENIA:
   Unclear if home zyprexa dose is accurate.  Will continue to try to
   confirm information; PCP will be in office today.
   - zyprexa 5mg daily for now
   # CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  baseline Cr 1.8, slightly elevated at
   2.0

","The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, non-verbal due to schizophrenia and mental retardation. He presented with NSTEMI and hyperglycemia. He has been diagnosed with a subacute stroke, likely cardioembolic in origin. The neurology team prefers not to use heparin gtt but states that it is okay if absolutely necessary for ACS. The patient has visual defects in the left eye but does not appear to have left-sided hemineglect. The neuro exam is limited due to the patient's schizophrenia and difficulty participating in the exam.
