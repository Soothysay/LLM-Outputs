   Hct increased from 21.3 to 30.6 then 29.6
   - Went for bleeding scan which was negative per IR
   - GI saw patient and recommended flex sig if he starts bleeding again,
   tranfuse for Hct<30, conservative management for now

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .
   Access: Rt PICC placed [**1-1**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea, and MRSA bacteremia. He has been experiencing various complications, including a melanotic GI bleed with a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), colitis of unknown etiology, enterobacter UTI, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient received 3 units of blood and 1 liter of normal saline, which responded well with an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 120-130. His Hct increased from 21.3 to 30.6, then 29.6. The bleeding scan was negative, and he is being monitored closely with serial hemocrits every 6 hours. He is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient is still experiencing melanotic stools, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy showed ulcerations consistent with colitis. The pathology has returned negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and viral culture has no growth to date. Despite this, he will continue to be treated for CMV with ganciclovir IV. He has been empirically treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with oral vancomycin, and his urine culture was positive for enterobacter.

The patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) was treated with ciprofloxacin IV, and he will continue to receive it for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding, which has been ongoing. The patient received 3 units of blood and 1 liter of normal saline, resulting in an improved blood pressure. Hematocrit levels increased from 21.3 to 30.6 and then to 29.6, indicating ongoing bleeding.

The patient's heart rate remains persistently high, ranging from 100 to 120 beats per minute, and he is in atrial fibrillation. Diltiazem was started at a dose of 30mg orally four times a day for rate control.

The patient has allergies to gluten and augmentin (Amox Tr/Potassium Clavulanate). He is currently receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, and antibiotics such as ganciclovir, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Blood pressure is within normal range but fluctuating. Respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals diminished peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, abdominal distension with hypoactive bowel sounds, and no lower extremity edema. There is also an area of erythema on"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt
   [**Name (NI) **] noted to have evolution of guaiac positive stools through day
   yesterday with stable PM HCT of 31.1 and subsequent melena overnight
   with passage of clots this morning and AM HCT of 21.4. Has known
   colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated empirically
   with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated for c. diff
   with oral vancomycin. Though he known causes for a lower GI bleed, the
   presence of melena is more suggestive.
   - Attempt to place additional IV access to assist in resuscitation
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse two units PRBC
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Bleeding scan to help localize location of bleeding
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and various medical complications. The key medical complications mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. GI bleed: The patient has experienced evolution of guaiac positive stools, melena, and passage of clots. This suggests an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations, being treated empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, he is being treated for C. diff with oral vancomycin. There are plans to place additional IV access, transfuse blood products, administer pantoprazole, and consider a bleeding scan.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had a positive urine culture for Enterobacter. Ciprofloxacin IV was started and will be continued for a total of 7 days.

3. MRSA bacteremia: The patient had a previous MRSA bacteremia, but surveillance blood cultures since admission have been without growth. The PICC tip culture showed no growth, indicating resolution of the infection. However, due to the patient's past history of endocarditis, there is an increased risk for recurrent endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been scheduled to evaluate for vegetations.

4. Right upper extremity (RUE) swelling: This is likely due to a right cephal"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, will consider flex sig
   if bleeds again.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h?
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and MRSA bacteremia on 12/17/2013. The patient's course has been complicated by melanotic GI bleed, Hct drop, and resuscitation with 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient's Hct is currently stable at 32.2. The patient also has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations, being treated empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, the patient is being empirically treated for C. diff with oral vancomycin. 

Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient experienced a melanotic GI bleed with a significant drop in Hct. The patient was resuscitated with 3 units of packed red blood cells and is currently stable with a Hct of 32.2. Further evaluation and management are ongoing.
2. Urinary tract infection: The patient had a positive urine culture for enterobacter on 12/31/2013. Ciprofloxacin IV was started and will be continued for a total of 7 days.
3. MRSA bacteremia: The patient had a previous episode of MRSA bacteremia. Surveillance blood cultures since admission have been without growth, and the PICC tip culture also showed no growth. Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h is being continued, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is scheduled for today.
4. RUE swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity (RUE), likely due to a right cephalic vein clot. Anticoagulation is not indicated at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with history of celiac disease and now with recent findings
   of ulcerations in colon has had onset of brisk GI bleed leading to
   transfer to ICU for further care.  We did pursue obtaining adequate IV
   access and then tagged RBC scan which failed to show source of bleeding
   and this in the setting of stabilization of HCT does suggest that acute
   and brisk bleeding has stopped but given production of maroon stool
   this morning ongoing bleeding is of concern.  This is, of course,
   clinical improvement in stability but does make identification of
   source of bleeding more challenging at this time.  With GI, IR and
   surgery all involved will move to coordinated plan of watchful waiting
   iwth continuation of current treatment plan.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of celiac disease who has been admitted to the ICU due to a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has been experiencing fatigue, and his vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 mmHg to 161/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's past medical history includes celiac disease, and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for constitutional fatigue. He has allergies to gluten and augmentin. The patient has received various medications including gancyclovir, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, morphine sulfate, and pantoprazole.

Laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, slightly low platelet count of 358, normal creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, elevated glucose level of 326 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, low magnesium, and normal calcium. Imaging reveals no evidence of bleeding, and the patient tested negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV).

   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32 this AM.  Cdiff negative.  Pt
   has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. GI following.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct Q12H
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - d/c PO Vanc
   #. Urinary tract infection: Urinalysis and culture was drawn on
   [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising
   leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision
   hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on
   [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**], now on day 4)
   #. MRSA bacteremia: PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood
   cultures since admission have been without growth. PICC tip was sent
   for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth. TTE on
   [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not
   rule out small vegetations. Patient has a past history of endocarditis
   in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID
   consult recommending TEE.
   - TEE likely today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**] , now on
   day 16/indeterminant course)
   #. RUE swelling: Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
    #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with
   ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has returned negative for CMV, viral
   culture no growth to date. CMV viral load negative. Despite this will
   continue to treat for CMV with ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the
   ICU, patient had received a few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic
   dilation as a hearld for worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative
   for concerning changes. C. diff has been negative for 6 separate
   measures (last on [**2164-1-2**]).
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue IV ganciclovir, d/c PO Vanc. Ideally will switch to PO
   ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:  Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking
   gluten free medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - consider restarting metoprolol
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - consider restart Metoprolol with holding parameters, hold femlodipine
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and various complications including MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter urinary tract infection. He was admitted to the ICU for melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight. The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, and multiple other medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of melanic stools and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating possible ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, has been started to reduce the risk of further bleeding.

2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for enterobacter, which suggests a urinary tract infection. Ciprofloxacin IV has been initiated for a total of 7 days.

3. MRSA Bacteremia: Although the patient's PICC line tip culture was negative for MRSA, there is still a concern for recurrent endocarditis due to his past history. Vancomycin IV will be continued for an indeterminate course.

4. Colitis: The patient has ulcerations in the colon, leading to the diagnosis of colitis. Ganciclovir IV has been started empirically, although pathology has returned negative for cytomegalovirus (CM"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and various medical complications. He presented with diarrhea and was diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and an enterobacter urinary tract infection. The patient has been in the ICU for melanic stools with a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, requiring blood transfusions. He also has a history of endocarditis, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended to determine the length of treatment. The patient's conditions include gastrointestinal bleed, fever of unknown origin, urinary tract infection, MRSA bacteremia, right upper extremity swelling due to a superficial vein clot, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and colitis. The patient has severe refractory celiac disease and is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He also has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has experienced a melanotic GI bleed, which resulted in a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. Further evaluation and management are required to prevent recurrent bleeding.
2. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has persistent low-grade temperatures, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Identification of the source of infection is crucial to guide appropriate treatment.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine culture was positive for Enterobacter"

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32 this AM.  Had brown stool
   today.  Cdiff negative.  Pt has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations
   which is being treated empirically with ganciclovir. GI following.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole at home dose, PO
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct Q12H
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - d/c PO Vanc
   #. Urinary tract infection: Urinalysis and culture was drawn on
   [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising
   leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision
   hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on
   [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**], now on day 4)
   #. MRSA bacteremia: PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood
   cultures since admission have been without growth. PICC tip was sent
   for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth. TTE on
   [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not
   rule out small vegetations. Patient has a past history of endocarditis
   in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID
   consult recommending TEE.
   - TEE likely today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**] , now on
   day 16/indeterminant course), hold tomorrow mornings dose and check a
   level given elevated level this AM
   #. RUE swelling: Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
    #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with
   ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has returned negative for CMV, viral
   culture no growth to date. CMV viral load negative. Despite this will
   continue to treat for CMV with ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the
   ICU, patient had received a few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic
   dilation as a hearld for worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative
   for concerning changes. C. diff has been negative for 6 separate
   measures (last on [**2164-1-2**]).
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue IV ganciclovir, d/c PO Vanc. Ideally will switch to PO
   ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:  Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking
   gluten free medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - restart metoprolol and d/c diltiazem (on home metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - restart Metoprolol with holding parameters, hold femlodipine
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and presentation with diarrhea. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, urinary tract infection, MRSA bacteremia, and colitis of unknown etiology. The patient has received treatment for these conditions including red blood cell transfusion, pantoprazole, ganciclovir, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but there are ongoing concerns regarding the potential for further complications such as recurrent endocarditis, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's family will bring in all foods and medications to ensure they are gluten-free due to his celiac disease. The plan moving forward includes a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for valvular vegetations, continuing with ganciclovir treatment, restarting metoprolol, discontinuing diltiazem, and holding aspirin and femlodipine. The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will continue with glycemic control measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with significant celiac disease and ulcerating lesions noted
   in the colon we have patient admitted with GI bleed concerning for
   lower source.  Importantly bleeding appears to have slowed
   substantially and we have seen an increasing difficulty in capacity to
   identify source.  We have coordinated plan with GI and surgery and IR
   and will currently continue to monitor HCT and consider flexible
   sigmoidostomy vs. bleeding scan for any recurrent evidence of bleeing.
   We will have to consider treatment for CMV as reasonable across time
   given concern for contribution to ulcerating lesions.
   1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)-
   -Flex sig deferred with stable HCT
   -GCV to be continued x 21 days
   -HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -Monitor BM's for evidence of blood.
   -PPI to continue
   -With stability will have to consider transfer to floor following TEE
   today
   2)UTI-
   -Cipro day [**5-10**]
   3)MRSA Bacteremia-
   -TEE today to evaluate for vegitations
   -Continue Vancomycin
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: PO diet to advance as limited by celiac
continue with TPN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with significant celiac disease and ulcerating lesions in the colon. He was admitted with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which appears to have slowed down substantially. The source of the bleeding is difficult to identify. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 C (99.8 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/58 mmHg to 148/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on various medications including pantoprazole, augmentin, gancyclovir, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 445 K/uL, platelet count of 358, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 109 to 236 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated levels of PT and PTT with a normal INR, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's physical examination revealed signs of atrial fibrillation, diminished breath sounds, and right lower extremity edema. The patient's neurologic status is described as attentive and responsive to verbal stimuli.

The assessment and plan include monitoring the patient's hematocrit (H"
