","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, diabetes, and a T12 burst fracture resulting in lower extremity paralysis. She was admitted from a nursing home with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia consistent with sepsis physiology. She is currently in the ICU for sepsis, presumed urosepsis due to a prior UTI in the nursing home. She has been receiving fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) for the infection. She is also on phenylephrine for pressure support and has been given a total of 8 liters of fluids since ER admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition is complicated by sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has hypoxia with an unclear etiology and a convincing pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray. This may indicate early ARDS, which is a serious complication characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired oxygenation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely secondary to sepsis physiology. Close monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap metabolic acidosis with an AG (anion gap) of 18,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus, and a T12 burst fracture resulting in lower extremity paralysis. She was admitted from a nursing home with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia, suggesting sepsis physiology. The patient is currently on phenylephrine and receiving fluid boluses. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn) have been initiated. The goal for the next 24 hours is to continue volume resuscitation as needed, follow up on blood cultures, and titrate phenylephrine for pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia, which are consistent with sepsis physiology. Presumed urosepsis due to a prior urinary tract infection (UTI) in the nursing home is a concern.
2. Hypoxia: The etiology of the hypoxia is possibly due to aspiration, pneumonia (PNA), or volume overload. There is no convincing pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray, but oxygenation is improving. Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a concern, especially considering the patient's baseline Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, diabetes, and T12 burst fracture admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia consistent with sepsis physiology. The patient is presumed to have urosepsis due to a prior urinary tract infection in the nursing home. She is currently receiving fluid boluses and phenylephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia suggests sepsis. The presumed urosepsis may progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia could be related to aspiration, pneumonia, or volume overload. There is a concern for early ARDS, especially considering the baseline COPD.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's likely secondary acute renal failure is due to sepsis physiology. Close monitoring of creatinine levels is necessary.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 18, likely secondary to lactate elevation in the setting of sepsis physiology.
5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that was recently seen by plastics as an outpatient. It is important to continue wound care and prevent further deterioration.

   # Sepsis. Presumed urosepsis due to prior UTI in nursing home,
   currently on phenylephrine (1.5mcg) and receiving fluid boluses.
   - Follow up blood, urine, sputum cultures.
   - Check vancomycin trough today (goal 15-20)
   - Continue to volume rescucitate as needed.
   - Continue Broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and zosyn.
   - Titrate phenylephrine for pressure support as necessary.
   # Hypoxia. Etiology possibly due to aspiration, PNA, or volume
   overload. No convincing pulmonary infiltrate on CXR. Improving
   oxygenation on presentation to the ICU. Concern for early ARDS. This
   may also be related to baseline COPD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus, and a T12 burst fracture complicated by lower extremity paralysis. She was admitted from a nursing home with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia consistent with sepsis physiology. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, presumed urosepsis due to a prior urinary tract infection in the nursing home. She is currently on phenylephrine and receiving fluid boluses. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered, and she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient also has hypoxia, possibly due to aspiration, pneumonia, or volume overload. No convincing pulmonary infiltrate was seen on the chest X-ray, but her oxygenation is improving. There is concern for early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or it may be related to baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis physiology. Her creatinine levels are elevated, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is also increased. A gap metabolic acidosis has been identified, with an anion gap of 18, likely secondary to lactate elevation in the setting of sepsis physiology.

The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that has improved since being seen by plastics as an outpatient. She will continue to be monitored, and wound care nursing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus, and a T12 burst fracture resulting in lower extremity paralysis. She was admitted with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia consistent with sepsis physiology. The patient has been liberated from vasoactive medications and is now normotensive. Her vital signs are stable, and she is oxygenating well on room air. The patient has multiple comorbidities including COPD, anemia, cardiac enzyme elevation, mild transaminitis, GERD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and neuropathy. She requires ongoing management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia suggests sepsis. It is crucial to continue monitoring her vitals, blood cultures, and urine/sputum cultures to identify the source of infection and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's etiology of hypoxia may be due to aspiration, infectious pneumonia, or pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support if needed is essential.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis physiology. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary.
4. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:"
