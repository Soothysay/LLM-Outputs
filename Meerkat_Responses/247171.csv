   known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST depression
   consistent with NSTEMI.
   #Aortic stenosis: Undergoing evaluation by cardiac surgery for
   potential CABG, aortic valve replacement.  Patient is extremely high
   risk for surgery, particularly if MR continues to be present and if
   patient would need both aortic and mitral valve replacement.  Patient
   however wants to have surgery as he feels that this is his only
   option.  Pre-op workup complete, urinalysis, carotid ultrasound done
   yesterday.
   -          repeat echo today to evaluate any improvement in MR s/p
   diuresis.

   # NSTEMI: Cath with stenting of RCA with BMS
   -          continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   -          no ace-I currently given [**Last Name (un) 2406**] and low pressures.
   # Shortness of breath, hypoxia: secondary to acute systolic congestive
   heart failure. improved today on new diuretic regimen of lasix gtt and
   metolazone.
   - continue low dose beta blocker at 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **].
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient has a [**Hospital1 4578**]
   creatinine of 1.2-1.4. On presentation at 1.6, now 2.6.  Likely due to
   poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis.  Patient however
   absolutely needs to be diuresed, this will only be corrected with
   aortic valve repair in all likelihood.
   - will trend creatinine, lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   # Diabetes: controlled on metformin at home
   - continue on glargine.
   - ISS

   - Hold home meds
   # Hypertension.  Patient is now normotensive likely due to mild
   cardiogenic shock. Continue beta blocker
   - Hold ACEi given compromised kidney function
   - Hold Nifedipine
   - Continue with low dose beta blocker if pressure tolerates
   # Trauma to face, s/p fall onto right side.  Patient denies LOC,
   altered sensorium, weakness, palpitations, preceding chest pain, and
   postictal state.  Patient is neurologically intact on exam.  No broken
   bones visible on CXray.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He was admitted with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the right coronary artery using bare-metal stent.

The patient's current presentation includes shortness of breath and hypoxia secondary to acute systolic congestive heart failure, which has improved with a new diuretic regimen. He also has acute-on-chronic kidney disease, likely due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis. The patient's creatinine level has risen from 1.2-1.4 to 2.6.

The patient's medications include aspirin, Plavix, high-dose atorvastatin, and metoprolol at a dose of 12.5mg. His diabetes is controlled with metformin at home, and he will continue on glargine insulin. The patient's hypertension is being managed with beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors are held due to compromised kidney function.

The patient has a history of trauma to his face after a fall, but he denies any loss of consciousness, altered sensorium, weakness, palpitations, or postictal state. His neurological exam is intact, and there are no visible broken bones on the chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the RCA using a bare-metal stent. The patient also has aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and is being evaluated by cardiac surgery for potential CABG and aortic valve replacement. However, he is considered extremely high risk for surgery due to his condition. The patient's current issues include acute systolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, trauma to the face, atrial fibrillation, and pernicious anemia. He is currently in the ICU receiving treatment and monitoring for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's shortness of breath and hypoxia are secondary to acute systolic congestive heart failure. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening kidney function. If left untreated, this can progress to end-stage renal disease and may require dialysis.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis can worsen over time, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential complications such as syncope, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with diabetes, hyperlipedemia, and hypertension without past
   known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST depression
   consistent with NSTEMI.
   #Aortic stenosis:
   Scheduled for CABG, aortic valve replacement next week.  Patient is
   high risk for surgery, particularly if MR continues to be present and
   if patient would need both aortic and mitral valve replacement.
   Moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], though [**Last Name (Titles) **] does not show up in computer system.
   Patient feels is his only option.  Pre-op workup complete, urinalysis,
   carotid ultrasound done yesterday (<40% stenosis bilaterally).

   of electrolytes
   - continue low dose beta blocker at 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]
   # Acute on chronic kidney failure:
   The patient has a [**Hospital1 4578**] creatinine of 1.2-1.4. On presentation at
   1.6, now 2.6.  Likely due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic
   stenosis.  Patient however needs continued diuresis in order to get
   surgical aortic valve repair, which would improve his forward cardiac
   flow
   - will trend creatinine, lytes [**Hospital1 **].

   - Hold oral home meds
   # Hypertension:
   Patient is now normotensive in setting of mild cardiogenic shock.
   - Hold ACEi given compromised kidney function

   heart rate
   # Trauma to face, s/p fall onto right side.  Patient denies LOC,
   altered sensorium, weakness, palpitations, preceding chest pain, and
   postictal state.  Patient is neurologically intact on exam.  No broken

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent coronary catheterization and had a bare-metal stent placed in the right coronary artery. The patient is now being evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). He also has atrial fibrillation and has been loaded with amiodarone. His kidney function has worsened from a baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.4 to 2.6 due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis. The patient requires continued diuresis to optimize his condition for upcoming surgical aortic valve repair. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic stenosis: The patient has aortic stenosis and is scheduled for CABG and aortic valve replacement next week. He is at high risk for surgery, particularly if MR continues to be present and if the patient would need both aortic and mitral valve replacement.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms have improved with diuresis, but he continues to have ongoing fluid overload. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary, and the diurese rate needs to be adjusted accordingly.
3. Acute on chronic kidney failure: The patient's"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He also has aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the right coronary artery using a bare metal stent (BMS). He is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement next week. However, he is considered high risk for surgery due to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and the possibility of needing both aortic and mitral valve replacement.

The patient was loaded with amiodarone twice and is currently on PO doses of 400mg. He started anticoagulation yesterday after an episode of atrial fibrillation. The dose of amiodarone can be decreased to 200mg tomorrow, and he will continue on low-dose beta blockers.

The patient's NSTEMI symptoms improved with stenting of the RCA using a BMS. He will continue aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin. No ACE inhibitors are currently given due to low pressures.

The patient's acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure symptoms improved with diuresis. He will continue lasix gtt at a slower rate, aiming for an output of -500cc, with close monitoring of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient has been diagnosed with aortic stenosis and is scheduled for CABG and aortic valve replacement next week.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac Complications:
   - Aortic stenosis can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
   - Coronary artery disease may result in recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
   - Postoperative complications such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and pericardial effusion are possible after cardiac surgery.

2. Renal Complications:
   - Acute kidney injury due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis and use of nephrotoxic medications.
   - Chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension.

3. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pneumonia due to immobility and aspiration risk.
   - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following cardiac surgery.

4. Neurological Complications:
   - Stroke due to atrial fibrillation or embolism from atherosclerotic disease.
   - Cognitive impairment or delirium due to metabolic disturbances or medication effects.

5. Infection Complications:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient has been scheduled for CABG and aortic valve replacement next week but is considered high risk due to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and the potential need for both aortic and mitral valve replacement.

The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, which has been loaded with amiodarone twice, and a decrease in the PO dose of amiodarone to 200mg. He is also on heparin gtt for paroxysmal AFib. The patient has undergone catheterization with stenting of the RCA using a bare metal stent (BMS).

The patient also has acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure secondary to aortic stenosis. His symptoms have improved with diuresis, and he needs to be well diuresed prior to surgery without being over-diuresed. The patient's acute on chronic kidney failure is likely due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis. He needs continued diuresis to get surgical aortic valve repair, which would improve his forward cardiac flow.

The patient's diabetes is controlled on metformin at home, and his hypertension is now normotensive in the setting of mild cardiogenic shock. His current medications include aspirin,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent a PCI procedure and is scheduled for CABG and AV replacement tomorrow. The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic kidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, and trauma to the face.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Post-operative complications: The patient is undergoing major surgery (CABG and AV replacement), which carries a risk of post-operative complications such as bleeding, infection, arrhythmias, and heart attack.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis, there is a risk of cardiac complications during and after surgery, including myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Kidney complications: The patient has acute on chronic kidney failure, and the use of contrast during cardiac catheterization and potential intraoperative fluid shifts may further compromise renal function.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and there is a risk of exacerbation during and after surgery due to blood loss or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Infection: As with any invasive procedure, there is a risk of infection at the surgical site or elsewhere in the body.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's breathing may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient underwent a PCI procedure and is scheduled for CABG and AV replacement tomorrow. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are as follows:
1. Aortic stenosis: The patient has moderate MR (mitral regurgitation) due to aortic stenosis. This condition will be addressed during CABG and AV replacement surgery. However, the patient is at high risk for surgery, and there is a possibility of complications during the procedure.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms improved with diuresis but requires careful management to avoid over-diuresis. Delicate balance is needed as the patient has severe AS (aortic stenosis).
3. Acute on chronic kidney failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from presentation, likely due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis. Diuresis has helped improve kidney function, but ongoing monitoring is required.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is currently controlled on metformin at home. In the ICU, the patient will continue on glargine insulin and ISS (insulin sliding scale) as needed.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is now controlled with low-dose beta-blocker"

   Imaging: CXR [**3-25**]
   HISTORY: Pre-op for CABG.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-21**], there has been substantial
   decrease in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications. This is probably
   related
   to the upright position with the pleural effusions bilaterally no
   longer
   layering along the posterior chest wall. There is increased
   opacification in
   the retrocardiac region. It is unclear whether this represents
   atelectatic
   change or possibly supervening consolidation.
   No evidence of vascular congestion at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient underwent PCI procedure and is now scheduled for CABG and AV replacement tomorrow. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient feels surgery is his only option, and pre-operative workup is complete. Fluid status should be optimal for surgery. The patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday and has a mildly positive guaiac. Heparin was stopped due to concern for GI bleed. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been loaded with amiodarone twice, and is currently on low dose beta blocker and 200mg amiodarone. The patient also has a history of acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic kidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, and trauma to the face from a fall. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the patient is neurologically intact on exam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a mildly positive guaiac and heparin was stopped due to concern for GI bleed. This indicates a potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently on diuretics to manage fluid balance. There is a risk of fluid overload if the patient receives excessive fluids or if the diuretics are not effective.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has a history of acute on chronic kidney failure and elevated creatinine levels. There is a risk of further renal dysfunction during and after surgery.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure during and after surgery.
5. Infection: The patient is in the ICU and has multiple lines and tubes, which increases the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and surgery. Prophylactic measures such as heparin SQ are in place, but there is still a risk of developing a DVT.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential complications based on the provided information. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of NSTEMI, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient underwent a PCI procedure and is now scheduled for CABG and aortic valve replacement tomorrow. 

The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure secondary to aortic stenosis, acute on chronic kidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, trauma to the face, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been loaded with amiodarone twice and is on heparin gtt for paroxysmal AFib. The plan is to continue low-dose beta-blocker and 200mg amiodarone. Controlling heart rate is crucial to prevent hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient needs to be well diuresed prior to surgery but not over-diuresed. Close monitoring of fluid status is essential to avoid fluid overload.
3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated due to poor forward flow as a result of aortic stenosis. Diuresis has helped improve kidney function. Trending creatinine and electrolytes is important to monitor kidney function.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is trending down, and there is evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding."
