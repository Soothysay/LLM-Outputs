   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on [**Hospital 5398**] transfered to the MICU for
   respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/-
   multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient noted to have diffuse bleeding on
   right side today during bronchoscopy.  On lovenox for mechanical valve,
   however, given that patient is having significant bleed, will stop
   anticoagulation.  Cause for DAH remains unclear, but will evaluate for
   rheamtolgocial illnesses such as goodpastures, wegeners, SLE,
   antiphospholipid syndrome.  Alveolar bleeding may be secondary to
   superimposed infection, athough, chest CT abnormalities have been
   present for several months but is now worsening.  BAL positive for GNRs
   and GPC is concerning for superimposed pneumonia, so will double cover
   with vanco/zosyn/cefepime.
   - stop lovenox
   - wean FI02 as tolerated
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia
   - heme/onc consult for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   - right side down
   - ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   -f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures
   - f/u DIC labs (fibrinogen, FDP, d-dimer)
   - glucan, galactomannan
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to sedating medication.  However, will evaluate for
   sepsis.  Pulmonary bleeding does not appear significant enough to
   explain hypotension.
   - transfuse PRBCs
   - f/u blood, urine, bal cultures
   - send pleural fluid for cultures
   - d/c propoforl and use fent/versed for sedation
   - hold home Toprol dose
   .
   2.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).
   - send specimen from from pleurex catheter
   - consider CT chest with contrast for better evaluation
   .
   3.  Fever/ leukocytosis.  Developed leukocytosis following bronch.
   Undergoing evaluationg for infection.
   - f/u blood, bal, urine cultures
   - send pleural fluid culture
   - echo to evaluate for endocarditis
   .
   4.  Hematuria.  Patient noted to have hematuria prior foley placement.
   Previous urine samples have had hematuria as well.  Now anticoagulated
   with lovonex.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to a pulmonary-renal syndrome.
   - hold lovenox
   - renal consult to evaluate urine
   .
   5.  Aortic valve replacement.  Patient developed aortic secondary to
   radiation change.  Will have to hold anticoagulation for now given
   ongoing bleeding.
   - hold anticoagulation
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor
   .
   PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, VAP precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers and a mechanical heart valve, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and possible multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, pleural effusion, hematuria, and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing bleeding and requires further evaluation for potential underlying conditions such as Goodpasture's syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately supported with mechanical ventilation and interventions to control bleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the infectious source are crucial.
3. Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: The patient's hematuria and renal consultation raise the possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome. This condition can cause kidney dysfunction and further complicate the patient's respiratory status.
4. Bleeding Disorder: The patient's ongoing bleeding despite anticoagulation therapy indicates a possible bleeding disorder. Discontinuation of anticoagulation and evaluation for underlying bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on [**Hospital 5398**] transfered to the MICU for
   respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/-
   multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient noted to have diffuse bleeding on
   right side following bronchoscopy yesterday.  On lovenox for mechanical
   valve, however, given that patient is having significant bleeding,
   anticoagulation with lovenox was stopped. Cause for hemoptysis remains
   unclear, but will evaluate for rheamtolgocial illnesses such as
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  Alveolar
   bleeding may be secondary to superimposed infection, athough, chest CT
   abnormalities have been present for several months but is now
   worsening.   Also has history of radiation to chest, which may cause
   some bronchiectasis.   BAL positive for GNRs and GPC is concerning for
   superimposed pneumonia, so will double cover with
   vanco/zosyn/cefepime.  Currently on minimal vent support, so will hold
   off on steroids at present.
   - hold lovenox
   - wean FI02 as tolerated
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia
   - heme/onc consult for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   - right side down
   - ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures
   - f/u DIC labs (fibrinogen, FDP, d-dimer)
   - glucan, galactomannan
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to medications.  However, did require neo for 12 hours
   yesterday.   Will evaluate for sepsis.  Pulmonary bleeding does not
   appear significant enough to explain hypotension.
   - transfuse PRBCs to Hct of 25
   - f/u blood, urine, bal cultures
   - send pleural fluid for cultures
   -  fent/versed for sedation
   - hold home Toprol
   .
   2.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).   Pleural fluid now positive for GNRs and GPC
   (previously only positive for MRSA).
   - f/u cultures from pleurex catheter
   .
   3.  Fever/ leukocytosis.  Developed leukocytosis following bronch.
   Leukocytosis improved this morning.  Undergoing evaluationg for
   infection.
   - f/u blood, bal, urine cultures
   - send pleural fluid culture
   - echo to evaluate for endocarditis
   .
   4.  Hematuria.  Patient noted to have hematuria prior to foley
   placement.  Previous urine samples have had hematuria as well.  Now
   anticoagulated with lovonex.  Was evaluated by renal who does not feel
   that she has a pulmonary renal syndrome.  However, noted to have muddy
   brown casts today with no renal failure, which may be due to
   hypoperfusion yesterday following intubation.
   - hold lovenox
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   5.  Aortic valve replacement.  Patient developed aortic secondary to
   radiation change.  Will have to hold anticoagulation for now given
   ongoing bleeding.  Will need to re-address need for anticoagulation
   when hemoptysis is improved.
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor
   .
   PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, VAP precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers and an aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible multifocal pneumonia. She is currently intubated and on minimal ventilatory support. The patient has developed significant bleeding, including hemoptysis, and is on lovenox for her mechanical valve. The cause of the hemoptysis is unclear, but there are concerns for rheumatological illnesses such as Goodpasture's syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, SLE, or antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient's BAL culture is positive for gram-negative rods (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci (GPC), which suggests a superimposed infection. The patient will be covered with vancomycin, zosyn, and cefepime. Her platelet count is low, and she has a prolonged PT/PTT/INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress, and her condition may worsen if the alveolar bleeding continues or if there is a progression of pneumonia.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has developed hypotension following intubation, which could be due to medications or sepsis. It will need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a history of empyema and now has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient has a history of fever, diaphoresis, and significant bleeding. He was started on invasive ventilation and an arterial line. Bronchoscopy and multi-lumen catheter placement were also performed. The patient received blood transfusions and received treatment for suspected pulmonary-renal syndrome. Allergies to levofloxacin were noted. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg, with fluid intake and output recorded. The patient is receiving medications for pain, sedation, and vasopressor support. Blood cultures were obtained, and extensive workup was sent to investigate a potential bleeding disorder. Renal consultation was sought due to hematuria, but pulmonary renal syndrome was deemed unlikely. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies were performed, but no details are provided in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and blood cultures suggest the possibility of an infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of fever, hypotension, and hematuria. The patient has undergone multiple interventions including invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient's blood cultures were drawn, and he is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Renal and hematologic consultations have been requested due to concerns about potential bleeding disorders and pulmonary-renal syndrome. The patient's vital signs indicate fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased urine output. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,495 mL and output of 1,175 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. Blood tests reveal elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with elevated levels of D-dimer and LDH. The patient is receiving nutrition via a pulmonary formula and is being monitored for glycemic control. The patient's code status is unknown, and his disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Bleeding disorder: The patient's hematuria and low platelet count may indicate a bleeding disorder, which is being evaluated by hematologic consultation.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on [**Hospital 5398**] transfered to the MICU for
   respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/-
   multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient noted to have diffuse bleeding on
   right side following bronchoscopy yesterday.  On lovenox for mechanical
   valve, however, given that patient is having significant bleeding,
   anticoagulation with lovenox was stopped. Cause for hemoptysis remains
   unclear, but will evaluate for rheamtolgocial illnesses such as
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  Alveolar
   bleeding may be secondary to superimposed infection, athough, chest CT
   abnormalities have been present for several months but is now
   worsening.   Also has history of radiation to chest, which may cause
   some bronchiectasis.   BAL positive for GNRs and GPC is concerning for
   superimposed pneumonia, so will double cover with
   vanco/zosyn/cefepime.  Currently on minimal vent support, so will hold
   off on steroids at present.
   - hold lovenox
   - wean FI02 as tolerated
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia
   - heme/onc consult for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   - right side down
   - ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   -f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures
   - f/u DIC labs (fibrinogen, FDP, d-dimer)
   - glucan, galactomannan
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to sedating medication.  However, will evaluate for
   sepsis.  Pulmonary bleeding does not appear significant enough to
   explain hypotension.
   - transfuse PRBCs
   - f/u blood, urine, bal cultures
   - send pleural fluid for cultures
   - d/c propoforl and use fent/versed for sedation
   - hold home Toprol dose
   .
   2.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).
   - send specimen from from pleurex catheter
   - consider CT chest with contrast for better evaluation
   .
   3.  Fever/ leukocytosis.  Developed leukocytosis following bronch.
   Undergoing evaluationg for infection.
   - f/u blood, bal, urine cultures
   - send pleural fluid culture
   - echo to evaluate for endocarditis
   .
   4.  Hematuria.  Patient noted to have hematuria prior foley placement.
   Previous urine samples have had hematuria as well.  Now anticoagulated
   with lovonex.  [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to a pulmonary-renal syndrome.
   - hold lovenox
   - renal consult to evaluate urine
   .
   5.  Aortic valve replacement.  Patient developed aortic secondary to
   radiation change.  Will have to hold anticoagulation for now given
   ongoing bleeding.
   - hold anticoagulation
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor
   .
   PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, VAP precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight, but the hemoglobin level did not increase appropriately. Another unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was ordered this morning. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis and remained unchanged. Liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated. ANCA and [**Doctor First Name 1205**] tests were negative. Blood cultures were taken, and a trans thoracic echo was performed. The patient's allergies include levofloxacin, with a history of facial swelling. The last doses of antibiotics given were cefipime at 8:00 PM on 08/10/2129, vancomycin at 10:00 PM on 08/10/2129, and piperacillin at 12:00 AM on 08/11/2129. The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions, along with other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with hemoptysis, who is currently in the ICU. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight but did not show an appropriate increase in hematocrit levels. Another unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was ordered this morning. An echocardiogram did not reveal endocarditis and remained unchanged. Liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated. ANCA and [**Doctor First Name 1205**] were negative. The patient was evaluated by a renal specialist who does not believe she has hepatorenal syndrome. Muddy brown casts were observed in the urine, indicating hypotension following intubation. Thoracic surgery recommends a bronchoscopic procedure for the patient. The patient was afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Transfusion Reaction: The patient did not show an appropriate increase in hematocrit levels after receiving a blood transfusion. This could indicate a transfusion reaction or incompatibility. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of allergic reactions, fever, or other symptoms associated with transfusion reactions.

2. Infection: The patient's elevated LFTs may suggest liver involvement, which could be due to an infection. Additionally, the presence of muddy brown casts in the urine may indicate acute tubular necrosis, which can occur"

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
   aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
   motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
   mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral
   annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-5**], no
   change. If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude
   endocarditis

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on [**Hospital 5398**] transfered to the MICU for
   respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/-
   multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient with alveolar bleeding in context of
   anticoagulation with lovenox. However, undergoing workup for other
   causes of hemoptysis including goodpastures, wegeners, SLE,
   antiphospholipid syndrome.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**12-25**] history of radiation to chest,
   which may cause some bronchiectasis.   BAL positive for GNRs and GPC is
   concerning for superimposed pneumonia, has been on double coverage with
   vanco/zosyn/cefepime.  Currently on minimal vent support, so will hold
   off on steroids at present. s/p 5 units of PRBCs without appropriate
   bump in hct
   - bronchoscopy this AM
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (check vanc trough prior to next
   dose)
   - wean down PEEP, check ABG and see if patient ready for extubation
   - f/u heme/onc consult recs for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - hold lovenox
   - f/u ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - f/u glucan, galactomannan
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, but still without appropriate bump in Hct and
   required 5 units of pRBCs. Concern for hemolysis or bleeding into other
   areas. Also had some hematuria s/p foley placement but no hematuria
   noted overnight
   - check hemolysis labs
   - CT torso to r/o bleed
   - guiac stools
   - follow Hct Q8hrs
   .
   3.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to medications.  Also need to watch for sepsis. Now
   weaned off pressors, but developed shock liver with elevated
   transaminitis likely [**12-25**] hypotension. ECHO negative for vegetations
   - f/u blood, urine, bal cultures
   - send pleural fluid for cultures
   - watch BP and restart home metoprolol when stable and tolerated
   .
   4.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Have been anticoagulation for now
   given ongoing bleeding, however, if patient is not found to be actively
   bleeding and with no other sources of bleeding, consider starting on
   heparin gtt for her valve.
   - hold anticoagulation for now but if Hct stable and Ct torso and guiac
   negative, restart heparin gtt without bolus
   .
   5.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).   Pleural fluid now positive for GNRs and GPC
   (previously only positive for MRSA).
   - f/u cultures from pleural catheter
   .
   6.  Hematuria.  Patient noted to have hematuria prior to foley
   placement.  No hematuria noted overnight. No hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   - hold lovenox
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor
   .
   PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, VAP precautions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers (Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, thyroid cancer) who underwent aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been on anticoagulation therapy with lovenox, but developed bleeding and required 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) without an appropriate increase in hematocrit (Hct) level. She also has hypotension following intubation and is weaned off pressors. The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and an abnormal echo showing severe mitral annular calcification with mild functional mitral stenosis and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. She is on minimal ventilatory support and awaiting bronchoscopy results.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and pneumonia, which may lead to respiratory failure. She is currently on minimal ventilatory support.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's Hct level did not increase appropriately despite receiving 5 units of PRBCs, raising concerns for hemolysis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding into the lung and possible other areas could indicate a bleeding disorder or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Hypotension: The patient developed"

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
   aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
   motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
   mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral
   annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-5**], no

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of various cancers, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. She underwent an aortic valve replacement and has been on anticoagulation therapy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible multifocal pneumonia. She has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown hemoptysis as her chief complaint. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. There is a concern for superimposed pneumonia, as indicated by the presence of GNRs and GPC in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is currently on minimal vent support and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, cefepime).

2. Decreased Hct: The patient has had an episode of bleeding into the lung, which may explain some loss of blood. However, there has been no appropriate bump in Hct, and the patient required 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). This suggests potential ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension following intubation, likely secondary to medications. There is also concern for sepsis. The patient has been weaned off pressors but developed shock"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers and recent aortic valve replacement, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible multifocal pneumonia. She has been on anticoagulation with lovenox and has experienced bleeding, including hemoptysis and hematuria. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is intubated and receiving minimal ventilatory support. She has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to hypotension following intubation. Other findings include severe mitral annular calcification and mild functional mitral stenosis on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible pneumonia.
2. Hemolysis or bleeding into other areas, as indicated by the lack of appropriate bump in Hct despite receiving 5 units of PRBCs.
3. Hypotension following intubation, possibly secondary to medications.

   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
   aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
   motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is
   mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral
   annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-7-5**], no
   change. If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude
   endocarditis
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on [**Hospital 5398**] transfered to the MICU for
   respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/-
   multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient noted to have diffuse bleeding on
   right side following bronchoscopy yesterday.  On lovenox for mechanical
   valve, however, given that patient is having significant bleeding,
   anticoagulation with lovenox was stopped. Cause for hemoptysis remains
   unclear, but will evaluate for rheamtolgocial illnesses such as
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  Alveolar
   bleeding may be secondary to superimposed infection, athough, chest CT
   abnormalities have been present for several months but is now
   worsening.   Also has history of radiation to chest, which may cause
   some bronchiectasis.   BAL positive for GNRs and GPC is concerning for
   superimposed pneumonia, so will double cover with
   vanco/zosyn/cefepime.  Currently on minimal vent support, so will hold
   off on steroids at present.
   - hold lovenox
   - wean FI02 as tolerated
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia
   - heme/onc consult for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   - right side down
   - ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures
   - f/u DIC labs (fibrinogen, FDP, d-dimer)
   - glucan, galactomannan
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to medications.  However, did require neo for 12 hours
   yesterday.   Will evaluate for sepsis.  Pulmonary bleeding does not
   appear significant enough to explain hypotension.
   - transfuse PRBCs to Hct of 25
   - f/u blood, urine, bal cultures
   - send pleural fluid for cultures
   -  fent/versed for sedation
   - hold home Toprol
   .
   2.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).   Pleural fluid now positive for GNRs and GPC
   (previously only positive for MRSA).
   - f/u cultures from pleurex catheter
   .
   3.  Fever/ leukocytosis.  Developed leukocytosis following bronch.
   Leukocytosis improved this morning.  Undergoing evaluationg for
   infection.
   - f/u blood, bal, urine cultures
   - send pleural fluid culture
   - echo to evaluate for endocarditis
   .
   4.  Hematuria.  Patient noted to have hematuria prior to foley
   placement.  Previous urine samples have had hematuria as well.  Now
   anticoagulated with lovonex.  Was evaluated by renal who does not feel
   that she has a pulmonary renal syndrome.  However, noted to have muddy
   brown casts today with no renal failure, which may be due to
   hypoperfusion yesterday following intubation.
   - hold lovenox
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   5.  Aortic valve replacement.  Patient developed aortic secondary to
   radiation change.  Will have to hold anticoagulation for now given
   ongoing bleeding.  Will need to re-address need for anticoagulation
   when hemoptysis is improved.
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of various cancers and a mechanical aortic valve, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress caused by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible multifocal pneumonia. She has been experiencing hemoptysis, which is the coughing up of blood. The patient was transferred from another hospital and has a past medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which may lead to respiratory failure. The cause of hemoptysis is unclear, but it could be due to superimposed infection or radiation-induced bronchiectasis. She is currently on minimal ventilator support, and double coverage with vancomycin, zosyn, and cefepime is being given for pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension following intubation, likely secondary to medications. She required neosynephrine for 12 hours yesterday. Her hypotension may be due to sepsis or medication-related side effects.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient had a recent treatment for empyema with vancomycin. She now has a pleural effusion positive for GNRs and GPC (previously only positive for MRSA). There is no history of increased drainage from the pleurex catheter, and the effusion does"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on Vanco, found to have diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage +/- multifocal pneumonia extubated yesterday and reintubated
   this AM for respiratory failure.
   .
   1.Respiratory failure.  Reintubated this AM after respiratory failure
   off vent for 12 hours. Likely needs time to clear infection and also to
   recover from bleeding. No evidence of new bleed by CT chest. Patient
   with alveolar bleeding in context of anticoagulation with lovenox.
   However, undergoing workup for other causes of hemoptysis including
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  So far, lupus
   anticoagulant came back positive, but [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA negative. Other studies
   anti GBM, anticardiolipin are all still pending. Also with superimposed
   infection with BAL positive for GNRs and coag positive staph.
   - continue  vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (day#6)
   - type and screen, Q8h Hct, transfuse to Hct >25
   - f/u Anti-GBM, anti-cardiolipin, complements, vWD, riscocetin
   cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - no role for steroids currently
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, s/p 7 total units of prbcs. No active bleed on CT
   chest and no hematuria.  Guiac negative
   - follow Hct Q8hrs
   - continue to hold any anticoagulation
   .
   3.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Patient
s INR now subtherapeutic for
   anticoagulation for her mechanical AVR. Spoke to pt
s cardiologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1137**] this AM which noted that her type of mechanical AVR was lower
   risk for clot so ok to continue to hold anticoagulation while in acute
   risk for bleed
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   - follow coags
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Initially thought to be shock liver [**12-25**] hypotension.
   However, still trending upwards despite good BP over last 24 hours. No
   known h/o liver disease
   - continue to trend
   - send hepatitis serologies
   .
   5. Pleural effusions: Patient with left pigtail in. Followed by
   thoracics. Minimal serosanguinous drainage
   - per thoracics recs, start flush with 10cc saline QQ8h
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46-year-old female patient with a history of various cancers (Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, thyroid cancer) and an aortic valve replacement. She has been admitted to the ICU with hemoptysis and respiratory failure. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed no active sites of bleeding. She was intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated. However, she required reintubation this morning due to worsening respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Cefepime) for pneumonia, as well as other medications such as Lasix, Morphine, and Lorazepam. She has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for decreased hematocrit (Hct) levels. CT torso revealed no evidence of active bleeding or extravasation of contrast into the pleural space or abdomen. The patient has minimal free fluid in the abdomen, which is of simple fluid attenuation and not bloody in nature.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on Vanco, found to have diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage +/- multifocal pneumonia extubated yesterday and reintubated
   this AM for respiratory failure.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Reintubated this AM after respiratory failure
   off vent for 12 hours. Likely needs time to clear infection and also to
   recover from bleeding. No evidence of new bleed by CT chest. Patient
   with alveolar bleeding in context of anticoagulation with lovenox.
   However, undergoing workup for other causes of hemoptysis including
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  So far, lupus
   anticoagulant came back positive, but [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA negative. Other studies
   anti GBM, anticardiolipin are all still pending. Also with superimposed
   infection with BAL positive for GNRs and coag positive staph.
     is concerning for superimposed pneumonia, has been on double coverage
   with vanco/zosyn/cefepime.  Currently on minimal vent support, so will
   hold off on steroids at present. s/p 5 units of PRBCs without
   appropriate bump in hct
   - bronchoscopy this AM
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (check vanc trough prior to next
   dose)
   - wean down PEEP, check ABG and see if patient ready for extubation
   - f/u heme/onc consult recs for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - hold lovenox
   - f/u ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - f/u glucan, galactomannan
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, but still without appropriate bump in Hct and
   required 5 units of pRBCs. Concern for hemolysis or bleeding into other
   areas. Also had some hematuria s/p foley placement but no hematuria
   noted overnight
   - check hemolysis labs
   - CT torso to r/o bleed
   - guiac stools
   - follow Hct Q8hrs
   .
   3.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to medications.  Also need to watch for sepsis. Now
   weaned off pressors, but developed shock liver with elevated
   transaminitis likely [**12-25**] hypotension. ECHO negative for vegetations
   - f/u blood, urine, bal cultures
   - send pleural fluid for cultures
   - watch BP and restart home metoprolol when stable and tolerated
   .
   4.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Have been anticoagulation for now
   given ongoing bleeding, however, if patient is not found to be actively
   bleeding and with no other sources of bleeding, consider starting on
   heparin gtt for her valve.
   - hold anticoagulation for now but if Hct stable and Ct torso and guiac
   negative, restart heparin gtt without bolus
   .
   5.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).   Pleural fluid now positive for GNRs and GPC
   (previously only positive for MRSA).
   - f/u cultures from pleural catheter
   .
   6.  Hematuria.  Patient noted to have hematuria prior to foley
   placement.  No hematuria noted overnight. No hepatopulmonary syndrome.
   - hold lovenox
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 731], a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers (Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, thyroid cancer) and aortic valve replacement, was admitted to the ICU with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and suspected multifocal pneumonia. She underwent bronchoscopy without active bleeding sites, invasive ventilation, and was successfully extubated yesterday but required reintubation this morning due to respiratory failure. The patient received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and had blood streaked sputum post-extubation. A CT torso showed no active bleeding into the pleural space or abdomen, only minimal free fluid in the abdomen, which is likely simple fluid and not blood.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient required reintubation after experiencing respiratory failure off vent for 12 hours. This indicates ongoing respiratory distress and the need for continued mechanical ventilation support.
2. Alveolar bleeding: The patient has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which could be related to anticoagulation with lovenox. Other potential causes of hemoptysis, such as Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and antiphospholipid syndrome, are being evaluated. Lupus anticoagulant came back positive, while ANCA is negative.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2129-8-11**] 09:27 AM, which showed no active sites of bleeding.
- The patient was successfully extubated at 6pm, with some blood-streaked sputum observed post-extubation. A CT torso showed no active bleeding into the pleural space or abdomen.
- Early in the morning, the patient started to experience increased respiratory rate, tachycardia, and hypertension. Blood gases indicated decreasing ventilation, so the patient was switched to high-flow mask ventilation and then BIPAP. The examination and chest X-ray revealed increased fluid overload consistent with acute pulmonary edema. The patient was given 40mg IV lasix, 1mg IV morphine, and ativan. The CVP level was 10-12. The patient responded well to the treatment, with significant diuresis and improvement in breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate. Since then, the patient has been gradually weaned off BIPAP.
- The patient has a history of allergies to levofloxacin and facial swelling. They have been receiving various antibiotics, including piperacillin, cefipime, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/79mmHg to 188/100mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP level of 14mmHg. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 2,246mL and total output of 1,970mL since midnight, with a positive balance of 276mL.
- The patient requires respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The tidal volume (Vt) is 780mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 19cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 8cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 55, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 432.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function test results. The D-dimer level is also elevated.
- The CT torso reveals no evidence of active bleeding or contrast extravasation into the pleural space or abdomen. There is minimal free fluid in the abdomen, which is of simple fluid attenuation and not bloody in nature.
- The patient's assessment includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a full code status and the current disposition is unknown."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on [**Hospital 5398**] transfered to the MICU for
   respiratory distress secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/-
   multifocal pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient with alveolar bleeding in context of
   anticoagulation with lovenox. However, undergoing workup for other
   causes of hemoptysis including goodpastures, wegeners, SLE,
   antiphospholipid syndrome.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**12-25**] history of radiation to chest,
   which may cause some bronchiectasis.   BAL positive for GNRs and GPC is
   concerning for superimposed pneumonia, has been on double coverage with
   vanco/zosyn/cefepime.  Currently on minimal vent support, so will hold
   off on steroids at present. s/p 5 units of PRBCs without appropriate
   bump in hct
   - bronchoscopy this AM
   - vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (check vanc trough prior to next
   dose)
   - wean down PEEP, check ABG and see if patient ready for extubation
   - f/u heme/onc consult recs for etiology of pulmonary hemmorhage
   - type and screen, transfuse to Hct >25
   - hold lovenox
   - f/u ANCA, RF, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], Anti-GBM, antiphospholipid, anti-cardiolipin,
   complements, vWD, riscocetin cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - f/u glucan, galactomannan
   - consider steroids if patient decompensates, pulmonary block
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, but still without appropriate bump in Hct and
   required 5 units of pRBCs. Concern for hemolysis or bleeding into other
   areas. Also had some hematuria s/p foley placement but no hematuria
   noted overnight

   3.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation,
   likely secondary to medications.  Also need to watch for sepsis. Now
   weaned off pressors, but developed shock liver with elevated
   transaminitis likely [**12-25**] hypotension. ECHO negative for vegetations

   4.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Have been anticoagulation for now
   given ongoing bleeding, however, if patient is not found to be actively
   bleeding and with no other sources of bleeding, consider starting on
   heparin gtt for her valve.
   - hold anticoagulation for now but if Hct stable and Ct torso and guiac
   negative, restart heparin gtt without bolus

   5.  Pleural effusion.  Patient recently treated for empyema with
   vancomycin.  No history of increased drainage from pleurex catheter.
   Given, fevers, will evaluate for ongoing or new infection, though does
   not appear increased in size on chest imaging (although it was a
   non-contrast CT).   Pleural fluid now positive for GNRs and GPC
   (previously only positive for MRSA).

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers and recent aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and possible multifocal pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed no active bleeding sites. She was successfully extubated but experienced some blood-streaked sputum post-extubation. A CT torso showed no active bleeding into the pleural space or abdomen.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has alveolar bleeding while on anticoagulation therapy. Other causes of hemoptysis are being investigated, including Goodpasture's syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome. BAL results are positive for GNRs and GPC, suggesting a superimposed pneumonia. The patient is currently on minimal ventilator support, and steroids have been withheld for now.
2. Decreased Hct: The patient has had an episode of bleeding into the lung, which has contributed to a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. Despite receiving 5 units of packed red blood cells, the Hct has not improved significantly, raising concerns for ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. A CT torso is needed to rule out bleeding in other areas, and hemolysis labs should be checked.
3. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension following intubation, likely secondary to medications. This"

   1.Respiratory failure.   Respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia,
   hemoptysis, and pulmonary edema.  Patient was briefly extubated
   yesterday then re-intubated for flash pulmonary edema.  Self-extubated
   overnight and doing well.   Patient with alveolar bleeding in context
   of anticoagulation with lovenox and pneumonia. However, undergoing
   workup for other causes of hemoptysis including goodpastures, wegeners,
   SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  So far, lupus anticoagulant came back
   positive, but [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA negative. Other studies anti GBM,
   anticardiolipin are all still pending. Also with superimposed infection
   with BAL positive for GNRs and coag positive staph.
   - continue  vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (day#6)
   - type and screen, Q8h Hct, transfuse to Hct >25
   - f/u Anti-GBM, anti-cardiolipin, complements, vWD, riscocetin
   cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - no role for steroids currently
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, s/p 7 total units of prbcs. No active bleed on CT
   chest and no hematuria.  Guiac negative
   - follow Hct Q8hrs
   - continue to hold any anticoagulation
   .
   3.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Patient
s INR now subtherapeutic for
   anticoagulation for her mechanical AVR. Spoke to pt
s cardiologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1137**] this AM which noted that her type of mechanical AVR was lower
   risk for clot so ok to continue to hold anticoagulation while in acute
   risk for bleed
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   - follow coags
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Initially thought to be shock liver [**12-25**] hypotension.
   However, still trending upwards despite good BP over last 24 hours. No
   known h/o liver disease
   - continue to trend
   - send hepatitis serologies
   .
   5. Pleural effusions: Patient with left pigtail in. Followed by
   thoracics. Minimal serosanguinous drainage
   - per thoracics recs, start flush with 10cc saline QQ8h
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers and an aortic valve replacement. She presented with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, hemoptysis, and pulmonary edema. She was reintubated for respiratory distress and self-extubated overnight. The patient is being treated for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and multifocal pneumonia. She also has pleural effusions, one of which is positive for E. coli and Coag + staph. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is undergoing a workup for other causes of hemoptysis. She has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells. Her Hct is currently low, and she is being monitored closely. She has a history of hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. The patient's transaminitis is still trending upwards despite good blood pressure. She is also being evaluated for potential liver disease. The patient's anticoagulation therapy has been held due to her mechanical aortic valve replacement and the risk of bleeding. She is currently on noninvasive ventilation but has required invasive ventilation in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure due to pneumonia, hemoptysis, and pulmonary edema. She required reintubation and self-extubation. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and the need for continued ventilatory support.
2. Diffuse Alveolar"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished female who presented with cough, tachypnea, and dry mouth. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and required non-invasive ventilation, which was unsuccessful. The patient then required invasive mechanical ventilation and experienced self-extubation. She had been on nonrebreather support overnight. The patient has a history of allergies to levofloxacin with facial swelling, and she is currently on various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, cefepime, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 127/69 to 154/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on aerosol-cool with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, FiO2 of 70%, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,846 mL since 12 AM, with outputs totaling 4,970 mL including 270 mL of urine output. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2 of 150 mmHg, and HCO3- of 26 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, anxious expression, and diaphoresis. The patient has crackles and wheezing breath sounds, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Lab results show elevated leukocyte count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium, potassium, and glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

Potential Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), barotrauma, volutrauma, infection (due to central line, urinary catheter, or other invasive devices), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcer. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on Vanco, found to have diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage +/- multifocal pneumonia extubated yesterday and reintubated
   this AM for respiratory failure.
   .
   1.Respiratory failure.  Reintubated this AM after respiratory failure
   off vent for 12 hours. Likely needs time to clear infection and also to
   recover from bleeding. No evidence of new bleed by CT chest. Patient
   with alveolar bleeding in context of anticoagulation with lovenox.
   However, undergoing workup for other causes of hemoptysis including
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  So far, lupus
   anticoagulant came back positive, but [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA negative. Other studies
   anti GBM, anticardiolipin are all still pending. Also with superimposed
   infection with BAL positive for GNRs and coag positive staph.
   - continue  vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (day#6)
   - type and screen, Q8h Hct, transfuse to Hct >25
   - f/u Anti-GBM, anti-cardiolipin, complements, vWD, riscocetin
   cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - no role for steroids currently
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, s/p 7 total units of prbcs. No active bleed on CT
   chest and no hematuria.  Guiac negative
   - follow Hct Q8hrs
   - continue to hold any anticoagulation
   .
   3.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Patient
s INR now subtherapeutic for
   anticoagulation for her mechanical AVR. Spoke to pt
s cardiologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1137**] this AM which noted that her type of mechanical AVR was lower
   risk for clot so ok to continue to hold anticoagulation while in acute
   risk for bleed
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   - follow coags
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Initially thought to be shock liver [**12-25**] hypotension.
   However, still trending upwards despite good BP over last 24 hours. No
   known h/o liver disease
   - continue to trend
   - send hepatitis serologies
   .
   5. Pleural effusions: Patient with left pigtail in. Followed by
   thoracics. Minimal serosanguinous drainage
   - per thoracics recs, start flush with 10cc saline QQ8h
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor
   .
   PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, VAP precautions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing several health issues. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. She has also undergone an aortic valve replacement.
- The patient was initially placed on non-invasive ventilation but required invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. She self-extubated but was reintubated again.
- The patient has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and multifocal pneumonia. She is receiving treatment with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime for the infection.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammation.
- The patient has anemia with a decreased hematocrit level, possibly due to bleeding into the lungs.
- The patient has positive lupus anticoagulant, but ANCA is negative. Further tests for other causes of hemoptysis are pending.
- The patient's coagulation profile shows an increased prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a potential bleeding risk. However, her INR is subtherapeutic, suggesting a lower risk for clotting in the mechanical aortic valve.
- The patient has transaminitis, which is a condition characterized by elevated liver enzymes. This could"

She is undergoing a workup for other causes of hemoptysis, including Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient tested positive for lupus anticoagulant but negative for ANCA, complement, and galactomannan. Other studies such as anti-GBM, anticardiolipin, VWF, Factor 8, are still pending. She also has superimposed infection with BAL positive for Serratia marcescens, which is pansensitive. Pleural fluid is positive for E. coli and Coag + staph. The patient's hemoptysis has resolved off anticoagulation.

Plan:
1. Continue vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia (day#7), but discontinue Zosyn given sensitivities of bugs in BAL and pleural space.
2. Transfuse to Hct >25.
3. Follow-up Anti-GBM, anti-cardiolipin, VWD, ristocetin cofactor,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of multiple cancers, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. She underwent an aortic valve replacement and was found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, possibly multifocal pneumonia, and self-extubated overnight. The patient is currently on noninvasive ventilation and has been reintubated for flash pulmonary edema. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, hemoptysis, and pulmonary edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia, hemoptysis, and pulmonary edema. She was briefly extubated but required reintubation due to flash pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial.
2. Alveolar Bleeding: The patient is experiencing alveolar bleeding, which may be related to anticoagulation therapy. She is undergoing workup for other causes of hemoptysis, including Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Further investigation and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Superimposed Infection: The patient has a superimposed infection with BAL positive for Serratia marcescens, which is pansensitive. The pleural fluid is positive for E. coli and coag positive staph. Appropriate antibiotic therapy needs to"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 yo female with h/o Hodkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on Vanco, found to have diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage +/- multifocal pneumonia extubated yesterday and reintubated
   this AM for respiratory failure.
   .
   1.Respiratory failure.  Reintubated this AM after respiratory failure
   off vent for 12 hours. Likely needs time to clear infection and also to
   recover from bleeding. No evidence of new bleed by CT chest. Patient
   with alveolar bleeding in context of anticoagulation with lovenox.
   However, undergoing workup for other causes of hemoptysis including
   goodpastures, wegeners, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome.  So far, lupus
   anticoagulant came back positive, but [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA negative. Other studies
   anti GBM, anticardiolipin are all still pending. Also with superimposed
   infection with BAL positive for GNRs and coag positive staph.
   - continue  vanco/zosyn/cefepime for pneumonia (day#6)
   - type and screen, Q8h Hct, transfuse to Hct >25
   - f/u Anti-GBM, anti-cardiolipin, complements, vWD, riscocetin
   cofactor, factor VIII level
   - f/u BAL results, serial blood cultures, fungal cultures)
   - no role for steroids currently
   .
   2 Decreased Hct: Patient with episode of bleeding into lung explaining
   some loss of blood, s/p 7 total units of prbcs. No active bleed on CT
   chest and no hematuria.  Guiac negative
   - follow Hct Q8hrs
   - continue to hold any anticoagulation
   .
   3.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Patient
s INR now subtherapeutic for
   anticoagulation for her mechanical AVR. Spoke to pt
s cardiologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1137**] this AM which noted that her type of mechanical AVR was lower
   risk for clot so ok to continue to hold anticoagulation while in acute
   risk for bleed
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   - follow coags
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Initially thought to be shock liver [**12-25**] hypotension.
   However, still trending upwards despite good BP over last 24 hours. No
   known h/o liver disease
   - continue to trend
   - send hepatitis serologies
   .
   5. Pleural effusions: Patient with left pigtail in. Followed by
   thoracics. Minimal serosanguinous drainage
   - per thoracics recs, start flush with 10cc saline QQ8h
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue zocor
   .
   PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, VAP precautions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Lastname 731], a 46-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple cancers including Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. She underwent an aortic valve replacement and has a mechanical aortic valve. The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.

The patient was initially placed on non-invasive ventilation but required invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. She was extubated the next day but self-extubated at 1:00 AM on [8-13]. She was reintubated this morning for respiratory failure. The patient has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and multifocal pneumonia. She is receiving vancomycin, Zosyn, and cefepime for the pneumonia.

Laboratory results show an elevated WBC count and slightly low platelet count. The patient's Hct has decreased from 31.3 to 28.8. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, indicating anticoagulation. The patient is also positive for lupus anticoagulant, but ANCA negative. Other tests for anti-GBM, anticardiolipin, and complement levels are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

1. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to an infection and alveolar bleeding. She needs time to clear the infection and recover from bleeding. A workup is being done for other causes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hemoptysis. The patient has been extubated and remains on supplemental oxygen. Fluid balance is even after administration of lasix. Sputum culture is positive for serratia marscens, and pleural fluid is positive for MRSA and E. coli. The patient has a history of allergies to levofloxacin and facial swelling. Antibiotics have been stopped due to sensitivities. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 131/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 22 mmHg, with fluid intake and output balanced. The patient has crackles in the bases bilaterally, and imaging reveals severe consolidation in the right mid and lower lung and left lower lobe, which has improved slightly since admission. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, liver enzymes, and lactate levels. The patient is also found to have elevated levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen. Microbiology reports show growth of serratia marscens in the respiratory culture and E. coli and MRSA in the pleural fluid culture."

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known lastname 731], a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and aortic valve replacement, is currently admitted to the ICU. She was found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage +/- multifocal pneumonia, polymicrobial empyema, and underwent self-extubation. The patient's hemoptysis has resolved, likely due to anticoagulation, but further workup for other causes is ongoing. She has positive lupus anticoagulant, but negative ANCA, RF, complement, and galactomannan. Anti-GBM, anticardiolipin, VWF, Factor 8 levels are pending.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, and polymicrobial empyema.
2. Anemia: The patient remains anemic, but there is no evidence of further blood loss in the lungs, and a CT torso is negative for bleeding. The patient has received 7 total units of packed red blood cells, and her Hct is currently stable.
3. Anticoagulation management: The patient's INR is subtherapeutic for anticoagulation for her mechanical aortic valve replacement. Her cardiologist has agreed to continue holding anticoagulation while in the acute risk for bleed. Heparin will be resumed today with a goal"

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer. She underwent an aortic valve replacement and is currently on anticoagulation with lovenox. The patient was found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, multifocal pneumonia, and polymicrobial empyema. She self-extubated but is now breathing on her own.

The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly since the last update, with crackles at the bases bilaterally. However, she remains at risk for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient's hemoptysis has resolved since stopping anticoagulation.

The patient's anemia persists, but there is no evidence of further blood loss in the lungs or elsewhere. She has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells and her hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable. However, she will be resuming heparin today, so close monitoring is necessary.

The patient's liver enzymes continue to rise, initially thought to be shock liver due to hypotension. Further evaluation for hepatitis is being conducted.

The patient has left-sided empyema, with fluid positive for E. coli (sensitive to cefepime) and MRSA. The pigtail catheter will need to be removed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pleural effusion and respiratory distress. He has a history of polymicrobial empyema and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/76 to 173/138 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 17 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an intake of 2,167 mL, output of 3,920 mL, and a negative balance of 1,753 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, proton pump inhibitors, and other ICU medications. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, C-reactive protein, liver enzymes, and lactate levels, along with low albumin and lymphocyte count. Imaging reveals diffuse hazy lung fields consistent with pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of pneumonia and empyema, there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations and elevated CVP suggest a potential risk for hem"

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's disease, multiple complications from mantle XRT, breast and thyroid cancer. She was admitted to the MICU for hemoptysis and respiratory failure following left VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) done for workup of bloody pleural effusion. She developed left MRSA empyema and right PNA with evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage on bronchoscopy. She is now extubated since [**8-12**].

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/76 to 173/138 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Her recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 g/dL, hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL, platelet count of 360 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 28.3 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, glucose of 97 mg/dL, and an arterial blood gas showing pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 231.

Her physical examination reveals fine crackles in the right lower lung fields and a mechanical click from her mechanical aortic valve. Her left chest tube is draining 30cc of fluid overnight. Her peripheral pulses are assessed in the right radial, left radial, right dorsal pedal, and left dorsal pedal pulses. The rest of her examination findings are not assessed.

The patient's imaging shows a CXR with diffusely hazy lung fields consistent with layering pleural effusions. Her assessment and plan include continuing existing antibiotics, diuresis to achieve a target body weight loss of 500g, and discussing the possibility of discontinuing the left pigtail catheter with the thoracic team. Other plans include restarting heparin to achieve a target partial thromboplastin time of 50-60 seconds, transaminase follow-up to assess potential secondary liver involvement, discontinuation of statin therapy, and a regular diet.

Regarding potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her history of respiratory problems and recent complications. She also has a mechanical aortic valve, which requires anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. Additionally, her history of Hodgkin's disease and multiple complications from mantle XRT puts her at risk for further infectious and immunological complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's disease and complications from mantle XRT, including valvular disease and breast and thyroid cancer. She was admitted to the MICU for hemoptysis and respiratory failure following left VATS. The patient has had multiple complications, including left MRSA empyema, right PNA, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). She has been extubated since [**8-12**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which necessitated ICU admission. Given her history of valvular disease and previous complications, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The patient has had multiple infections, including MRSA empyema and PNA. There is a risk of further infections, especially with her compromised immune system due to previous treatments.

3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced hemoptysis and DAH. There is a risk of ongoing bleeding, particularly if her coagulation status is not carefully monitored and managed.

4. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), especially due to her mechanical atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR) and immobil"

","Summary:
The patient is in the ICU and has been receiving various medications including heparin for anticoagulation, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and furosemide for fluid management. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 to 140/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and has a sinus rhythm. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and lactate levels, as well as increased levels of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and D-dimer. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. Electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's critical condition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
2. Infection due to prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive lines.
3. Fluid overload or imbalance due to fluid management with furosemide.
4. Stress ulcer due to prolonged ICU stay.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 731**] is a 46 year old female with h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma,
   breast cancer, thyroid cancer, s/p aortic valve replacement on lovenox,
   with left sided empyema on Vanco, found to have diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage +/- multifocal pneumonia, polymicrobial empyema, doing well
   after extubation and resumption of heparin drip.
   .
1. Respiratory failure.  Patient currently doing well status post self-exubation
 over the weekend. Her prior respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia, hemopty
sis, pulmonary edema, and polymicrobial empyema, with re-intubation necessary af
ter receiving several blood products. Cause of patient
s alveolar bleeding still
 remains unclear aside from her anticoagulation (on lovenox) and pneumonia. Work
up for other causes of her DAH have has included Goodpastures, Wegeners, SLE, an
tiphospholipid syndrome.  So far, lupus anticoagulant, ACA, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA and comple
ment have been negative/within normal limits. RF, galactomannan ,GBM, VWF, Facto
r 8, are all still pending. Also with superimposed infection with BAL positive f
or Serratia Marscescens, pansensitive.  Pleural fluid positive for E. coli and M
RSA.  No further hemoptysis for >24 hours while on heparin gtt.
   - Continue  vanco /cefepime for pneumonia ( patient was on vanco for
   empyema previously), today is day#9
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts, transfuse to Hct >25
   - f/u pending studies as noted above.
   - no role for steroids currently
   - If patient is markedly positive, will plan to diurese with lasix,
   goal Os>Is 500 cc
 1 L, she appears fairly euvolemic on exam
   .
   2. Anemia.  Anemia remains stable.  No evidence of further blood loss
   in lungs and CT torso negative for bleeding.  Guaiac has been negative
   as well.   S/p 7 total units of prbcs. Hct currently stable, since
   re-initiation of heparin.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   3.  s/p Aortic valve replacement.  Patient
s INR now subtherapeutic for
   anticoagulation for her mechanical AVR. Team has discussed with
   patien
s cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1137**] which noted that her type of
   mechanical AVR was lower risk for clot so ok to continue to hold
   anticoagulation while in acute risk for bleed
   - Yesterday heparin gtt was resumed with goal PTT of 50-60, no bolus;
   monitor for hemoptysis
   - Following [**Hospital1 **] HCT and coag
   - Once stable on heparin gtt, will need to discuss re-initiation of
   lovenox.
   .
   4. Transaminitis: Trend improved today. Initially thought to be shock
   liver [**12-25**] hypotension. Studies sent off to evaluate for hepatitis as
   well given that LFTs appeared to still be rising over the weekend.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u hepatitis serologies (hepatitis, CMV, Herpes, varicella all sent)
   - d/c simvastatin
   .
   5. Empyema. Patient with left pigtail in.  Fluid positive E. coli
   (sensitive to cefepime) and MRSA.  Followed by thoracics. Minimal
   serosanguinous drainage.  Now afebrile with resolved leukocytosis.
   - per thoracics recs, flush with 10cc saline QQ8h
   - continue vanco/cefepime for empyema
will need to discuss length of
   treatment plans with thoracics team, as well as when pigtail should be
   removed. Will likely  need longer term abx therapy and PICC for cont
   abx.
   .
   6.  Hypothyroid.
   - continue levothyroxine supplementation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and aortic valve replacement. She was previously diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), multifocal pneumonia, polymicrobial empyema, and respiratory failure. She self-extubated over the weekend but is currently doing well on a heparin drip.

The patient's respiratory failure was initially caused by pneumonia, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema, and polymicrobial empyema. Re-intubation was necessary after receiving several blood products. The cause of the patient's alveolar bleeding remains unclear aside from her anticoagulation (on lovenox) and pneumonia. Workup for other causes of DAH has included Goodpastures, Wegeners, SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome. So far, lupus anticoagulant, ACA, ANCA, and complement have been negative/within normal limits. RF, galactomannan, GBM, VWF, Factor 8, and other tests are still pending.

The patient has a superimposed infection with BAL positive for Serratia marcescens, which is pansensitive. Pleural fluid positive for E. coli and MRSA. No further hemoptysis for >24 hours while on heparin gtt.
