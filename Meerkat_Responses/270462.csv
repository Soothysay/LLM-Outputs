","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) likely related to diverticulosis. The source of the bleed is unclear, possibly from the small bowel or diverticular bleed. A C-scope examination was negative, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at the outside hospital was also negative. There are no symptoms besides bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), which is not consistent with ischemic colitis, infectious enterocolitis, or a Crohn's flare.

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been transfused with 2 units of blood due to a low hematocrit (hct) level of 24.5%. Another 2 units have been ordered. The patient has experienced two episodes of maroon liquid stool, totaling 450cc, which prompted an immediate call to the interventional radiology (IR) department. They recommended a tagged red blood cell scan, which was performed stat at 5 a.m.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 100 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 109/59 mmHg to 112/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is on sinus tachycardia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's medical progress note in the ICU includes details such as chief complaint, 24-hour events, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, other medications, changes to medical and family history, review of systems, flowsheet data including vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, physical examination findings, lab results, imaging studies, microbiology reports, ECG findings, assessment, and plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infections: The presence of antibiotics and microbiology reports may indicate ongoing efforts to manage or prevent infections. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) could be potential risks.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis for DVT suggests the risk of blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: This indicates the risk of stress-related mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract, which can result in ulcers or bleeding.
4. Glycemic Control: Poor glycemic control can lead to complications like hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, increasing the risk of infections and other adverse outcomes.
5. Fluid Balance: Imbalances in fluid management may contribute to complications such as pulmonary edema or renal dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of the bleed is unclear, possibly originating from the small bowel or diverticular bleed. A colonoscopy was negative, and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not reveal any findings. The patient has been experiencing maroon liquid stool and has received blood transfusions. Additional tests, including a nuclear medicine RBC scan, have been ordered. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has been placed on NPO status. Medications include Vitamin K, levothyroxine, and H2 blockers. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's current condition of experiencing maroon liquid stool indicates ongoing bleeding. If the bleeding continues or worsens, it could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.

2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive procedures performed, such as the insertion of a power PICC line and potential endoscopic procedures. Infections can be caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through these lines or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding is likely related to diverticulosis. The patient has undergone an EGD at the OSH which was negative, and a C-scope that did not reveal a clear source of bleeding. The patient has been transfused with 2 units of blood and her hematocrit level is now 28%. A repeat RBC scan was negative this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 113/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on full code status and has been started on Golytely bowel prep for tomorrow's procedures. Surgery and GI consults have been obtained, and the patient will undergo EGD with push enteroscopy and colonoscopy tomorrow. The patient's labs show an elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and increased platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of Crohn's disease and the current lower gastrointestinal bleed, there is a risk of continued or recurrent bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to Crohn's disease and potential transfusion-related"

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, received an additional 3 Units of PRBCs and hematocrit went
   to 28.5% from 24% on admission here.
   Tm: 98   P: 90     BP: 113/62   Oxygen Sat: 95%  on Fio2
   General: Awake, alert NAD
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: Soft NT ND
   Ext: No edema
   Labs: reviewed and as above
   Assessment:
   1)      GI bleed
 likely lower GI bleed
   2)      History of Chrohn
   Plan:
   1)      Transfuse PRBC
   2)      Planning for upper and lower endoscopy tomorrow
   Addendum: In the afternoon, patient had sudden drop in blood pressure
   to 60 systolic and high volume of blood per rectum.  Despite initial
   resuscitation, patient remained hypotensive and hypo-perfused with
   mottling throughout her body.  We activated the massive transfusion
   protocol and provided resuscitation, intubated the patient when she
   developed mental status changes/shaking chills, and went to IR with
   patient but no active arterial bleeding noted.  Surgery was present for
   entire time period and decided not to go to the OR because unclear
   where the bleeding is coming from and did not want to take out portions
   of bowel that were not the source of the bleeding.  Thus, patient will
   be brought back to the ICU, prepped overnight, and have upper and lower
   endoscopy in the morning.
   Time Spent: 120 minutes
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The bleeding was likely related to diverticulosis. She underwent colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and a possible push enteroscopy. The source of the bleeding could not be localized, and the patient received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and 1 platelet transfusion. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) stabilized after the transfusions.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4. She is tachycardic and has a regular rhythm with no murmurs on cardiac examination. There is crepitation anteriorly on lung examination. Her abdomen is soft, nontender, and without masses or organomegaly. There is no edema or cyanosis on extremity examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.0-9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 14.0-18 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 28.5%-47.3%, platelet count of 96-155 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 17-21 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, total CO2 (TCO2) of 17-21 mmHg, glucose of 79-128 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

The patient's plan includes maintaining active type and cross-matching, monitoring potassium and calcium levels, removing the power PICC line, and maintaining a peripheral IV line. She will undergo further evaluation for the source of bleeding, and possible surgical intervention will be considered if necessary. The patient will be extubated following the c-scope/EGD if no other intervention is planned."

- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely related to diverticulosis.
- The patient has been experiencing intermittent bleeding, and angiography overnight did not indicate active bleeding despite a drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) and significant bloody rectal output.
- Surgery is holding off on total colectomy due to uncertainty about the location of the bleed.
- The patient has been started on a bowel prep for colonoscopy tomorrow, and a gastrointestinal consult has been ordered for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with push enteroscopy.
- The patient's blood products have been cross-matched and are available for transfusion, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given if more than 4 units of blood are transfused.
- Daily coagulation studies and hemoglobin checks will be performed.
- The patient's calcium levels will be repleted.
- Medications for Crohn's disease (asacol) and hypothyroidism (levothyroxine) are being held.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) as she may undergo endoscopic therapy (FEN).
- The patient's pain and discomfort are being managed with appropriate analgesics.

The source of the bleed has not been isolated, and angiography did not indicate active bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable overnight. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding: There is still a high suspicion for lower GI bleed, indicating a risk of re-bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, increasing the risk of infection.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and it needs to be managed while in the ICU.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient has a low calcium level, which needs to be repleted.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, likely related to diverticulosis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient underwent 12 units of packed red blood cells transfusion yesterday. Her hemoglobin concentration has dropped, and there is a high suspicion for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, although no source has been isolated. Angiography overnight did not indicate active bleeding despite a drop in hematocrit and significant bloody rectal output. Surgery is holding off on total colectomy due to uncertainty about the location of the bleed.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on current ventilator settings, and consideration for extubation will be made when she is hemodynamically stable. Daily chest X-rays will be performed. The patient's Crohn's disease requires continued azathioprine treatment, and she also has hypothyroidism, which requires continuation of levothyroxine.

The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed, and glycemic control should be monitored. The patient currently has two central lines, a right cordis and a left PICC line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed. She underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy, which showed no evidence of active bleeding but revealed several diverticuli in the sigmoid colon and shallow ulceration at the site of anastomosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remained stable, and she was extubated. She has left arm swelling, low-grade temperature, and an outer upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detected through bedside ultrasound. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/68 mmHg to 152/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's height is 65 inches, and her weight is not mentioned. Fluid balance shows an intake of 535 mL of total fluids, with 77 mL of that being intravenous fluids (IVF). Output includes 5580 mL of total out, consisting of 495 mL of blood products. Urine output is 1730 mL, and negative gastric (NG) output is recorded. The patient is not receiving respiratory support. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleed. She underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy, which showed no evidence of active bleeding, but revealed several diverticuli in the sigmoid colon and shallow ulceration at the site of anastomosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remained stable, and she was successfully extubated. She is currently experiencing left arm swelling, low-grade temperature, and has an OSH PICC line in place. The PICC line was removed and sent for culture. A chest X-ray was performed, and blood cultures were sent for evaluation of the low-grade temperature. Bedside ultrasound found left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient initially presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which is likely related to diverticulosis. Further diagnostic tests, such as colonoscopy, endoscopy, and possible push enteroscopy, will be performed to localize the bleed and determine the appropriate surgical intervention if necessary.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient previously required invasive ventilation but has now been successfully extubated. Monitoring her respiratory status will be important to ensure she maintains adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The bedside ultrasound confirmed the presence of a DVT in the patient's left arm. This"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed. The cause of the bleed is likely related to diverticulosis. The patient underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy, which showed no evidence of active bleeding but revealed several diverticuli in the sigmoid colon and shallow ulceration at the site of anastomosis.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/68 to 152/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a slight imbalance in fluid balance.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly decreased platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The assessment plan includes monitoring hemoglobin levels, maintaining active type and cross, monitoring potassium and calcium levels, maintaining peripheral intravenous access, and continuing medication for Crohn's disease and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of diverticulosis increase the risk of further gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with massive Crohn's and LGIB, likely from diverticulosis but
   source not completely clear, possibly from anastemosis at prior
   surgery, now stable. Unfortunately, she has a newly identified LUE clot
   associated with the prior PICC, but she has a clear contraindication to
   anticoagulation. Her crohn
s is a risk factor for clots, but no signs
   of clotting in other areas.
   Will continue discussion with GI and surgery about any additional
   studies. If rebleeds, plans may include for colectomy.
   GNRs on the gram stain noted but patient without respiratory symptoms
   and no infiltrate on the cxr. Will monitor for now and follow-up sputum
   cx. Given chronic tobacco use she may have colonizers.
   Will d/c aline but keep the cortis for now.
   Encouraged tobacco cessation and offered support. Pt is very motivated

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of massive Crohn's disease and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), likely due to diverticulosis. She is currently stable but has a newly identified left upper extremity (LUE) clot associated with the prior percutaneous insertion catheterization (PICC) line. However, she has a contraindication to anticoagulation. Her condition puts her at risk for further clotting, but no signs of clotting in other areas have been observed. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
- Heart rate: 77 bpm (64-110 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 141/77 mmHg (100-152/59-84 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (12-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of massive Crohn's disease and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), likely due to diverticulosis.
- The source of bleeding is not completely clear, but it may be from anastomosis at a prior surgery.
- The patient is currently stable, but a newly identified left upper extremity (LUE) clot has been identified, which is associated with the prior percutaneous internal jugular central venous catheter (PICC).
- The patient has a contraindication to anticoagulation, and her Crohn's disease is a risk factor for clots, although there are no signs of clotting in other areas.
- The patient's white blood cell count has fluctuated between 6.7 and 11.4 thousand cells per microliter.
- Her hematocrit levels have ranged from 43.2% to 47.3%.
- The platelet count has varied between 118 and 171 thousand cells per microliter.
- Other lab results show normal creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose levels, and electrolyte levels.
- The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 195, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35.
- Chest X-ray shows no infiltrate.
- The patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, have been within normal range.
- The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress.
- Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, anasarca (generalized edema), and warm skin.
- Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person.
- The patient has a history of chronic tobacco use and has expressed motivation to quit.
- The patient's care plan includes advancing diet to clear liquids, discussing additional studies with GI and surgery, monitoring for signs of rebleeding, and considering colectomy if rebleeding occurs.
- The patient's arterial line and central venous catheter were inserted on specific dates.
- Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with boots, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of massive Crohn's disease and LGIB, and there is a possibility of rebleeding, which could require surgical intervention such as colectomy.

2. Pulmonary embolism: The presence of a LUE clot raises the concern"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely related to diverticulosis. The patient had a large bleed on [**2141-2-8**] and is currently undergoing colonoscopy. Endoscopic therapy has been attempted but unsuccessful. The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 118/57 mmHg to 142/86 mmHg. The patient is also experiencing moderate bilateral arm erythema and has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, elevated potassium at 5.5 mg/dL, and low calcium at 6.9 mg/dL. The patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Imaging studies reveal active extravasation in the ileocecal region, which is most compatible with an acute bleed. The patient is being monitored closely for any further complications and potential medical complications that may arise."

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease presenting with a lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely related to diverticulosis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory compromise and low-grade fevers. The patient has undergone various interventions including angiography, which revealed active extravasation in the ileocecal region, indicating an acute bleed at that location. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being prepared for a colonoscopy to further evaluate the source of bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is tachycardic with a heart rate of 104 bpm. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is at 92% on room air. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin levels, indicating ongoing blood loss. She also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 156 thousand. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her upper extremity and is likely experiencing a lower GI bleed due to diverticulosis. The bleeding site was identified at the ileo-colonic anastomotic site, 1-2 cm distal to a clip placed during a recent colonoscopy. The patient underwent angiography, which revealed actively extravasating blood in the ileocecal region, most compatible with an acute bleed at that location. Despite attempts at endovascular treatment, the bleeding persisted, leading to a re-bled and an increase in heart rate from 70 to 100 beats per minute. The patient received 1 liter of normal saline and was prepared for surgery. However, the bleeding stopped, and the patient was placed on a conservative management plan. She also has a distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid, which requires clinical correlation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. Her laboratory results indicate anemia and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal a hemangioma and multiple cysts within the liver. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and anticoagulation therapy. Her code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU."

She has undergone colonoscopy and EGD with possible push enteroscopy. The patient experienced a large bleed on [**2141-2-8**] and is currently being monitored for any signs of bleeding. Her hemoglobin levels will be checked every 8 hours, and she will be transfused if her hemoglobin is below 30. She is also being monitored for potassium and calcium levels.

The patient has developed a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity and a possible lung embolism (LUE DVT). She has tested positive for GNR in her sputum and blood culture. Antibiotics have not been started unless the patient is febrile, unstable, or shows an increase in sputum production. She is currently on a clear diet and will follow up with gastrointestinal recommendations if any.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she had low-grade fevers overnight, so sputum was sent for culture. She tolerated extubation well. Her Crohn's disease is being managed with azathioprine, and she will continue with levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to divert"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The bleeding site was identified at the ileo-colonic anastomotic site, 1-2 cm distal to a clip placed during a recent colonoscopy. The patient experienced a re-bleed, resulting in an increase in heart rate from 70 to 100 beats per minute. The patient was given intravenous fluids and blood products, but further intervention, including angiography and catheterization, was required.

During the angiography, actively extravasating blood was found in the ileocecal region, consistent with an acute bleed at that location. The patient underwent repeated angio, but the bleeding source could not be localized. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, revealing actively extravasating blood in the ileocecal region, which increased in the later phases of the study. This finding is most compatible with an acute bleed at this location, adjacent to surgical clips.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination revealed tachycardia and moderate bilateral arm erythema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC)"

The bleed is likely from the anastomosis site of her prior surgery in 2126. The patient has been closely monitored in the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

The patient rebled, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) localized the bleeding to the anastomosis at the distal ileum. She received 2 units of PRBC and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with distension, and warm skin. Neurological assessment is not available due to the patient being unconscious. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes.

Imaging studies reveal active extravasation in the ileocecal region, compatible with an acute bleed at that location. There are"

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 175 K/uL, blood glucose level of 8 mg/dL, sodium level of 23 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. The imaging studies reveal active extravasation in the ileocecal region compatible with acute bleeding, adjacent to surgical clips. There are also findings of a hemangioma and multiple cysts within the liver, as well as a distended gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing supportive care with blood products, close monitoring,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed. The source of bleeding was identified as diverticulosis and was managed through colonoscopy, where five clips were applied to friable tissue at the anastomosis site. Despite no active bleeding observed during the colonoscopy, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) level decreased by 9 points overnight. The patient received 2 units of blood transfusion and her vital signs remain stable. She is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. Further plans include monitoring the post-transfusion Hct level, following up on coagulation studies, and consulting with GI and surgery teams. Additionally, the patient has a PICC line-associated left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is contraindicated for heparin. She will continue with azathioprine for Crohn's disease and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. In the ICU, she is being closely monitored for nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. Prophylaxis is provided for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient has a full code status and will be kept in the ICU for now. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Continued bleeding: Despite the application of clips during the colonoscopy, there is still a risk of ongoing or re-bleeding"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely related to diverticulosis. The patient underwent a colonoscopy today, during which no active bleeding was found. However, friable tissue along anastomosis was identified and treated with clips.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level trended down from 33% to 24% overnight, indicating significant blood loss. Vital signs have remained stable, with a blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl for sedation and pain management, respectively. Pantoprazole (Protonix) is being administered for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,982 mL, including 1,081 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 5,395 mL. Urine output is 2,495 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 45.5 g/dL (pre-transfusion), 39.3 g/dL (post-transfusion), and 33.8 g/dL on admission. Platelet count"

   Plan:

   2)      Remove all IVs from the left arm and treat with warm compresses
   and relative elevation.  Clearly, she is too high of risk for any form
   of anti-coagulation.  After surgery is complete and hemostasis is
   confirmed over a period of days, then I think that a repeat ultrasound
   of the left arm should be considered/performed to evaluate resolution
   vs. extension.  At that point a decision could be made about pro vs con
   of any form of anti-coagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding is likely related to diverticulosis. She underwent a colonoscopy and had five clips applied to friable tissue at the anastomosis site. The patient has been transfused with two units of blood overnight. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has trended down from 33% to 24%. No bloody stool has been observed, and her vital signs are stable. She is currently on midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the bleeding episodes. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on nasal cannula oxygen and in sinus rhythm.

On physical examination, she appears well, with no signs of distress. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, and her heart rhythm is regular with a slightly elevated heart rate. She has mild abdominal tenderness but no guarding or rebound. There is also mild lower extremity edema noted.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 x 10^3/mm^3, hemoglobin concentration of 45.5%, platelet count of 175 x 10"
