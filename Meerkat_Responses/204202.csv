","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), and uncontrolled type II diabetes. She was admitted with sepsis, multiple possible etiologies for infection, including abdominal infection, colonitis, thigh abscess, and line infection. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement in blood pressure and other vital signs. The patient's current conditions include an abdominal wall abscess, c.difficile infection, hypercoagulable state, liver disease, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which could be due to multiple possible sources of infection such as abdominal infection, colonitis, thigh abscess, and line infection. The sepsis has improved with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Abdominal Infection: The patient has an abdominal wall abscess that may require drainage. There is also evidence of diffuse bowel wall thickening, which could be due to third spacing and hypoalbuminemia, but colitis cannot be excluded.

3. Clostridium difficile Infection (c.diff): The patient has a history of recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use and positive c.diff test at her rehabilitation center. She will need to continue receiving metronidazole and vancomycin for at least 10 days post-completion of other antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, history of necrotizing fasciitis, abdominal wall abscess, and recent E. coli and Pseudomonas bacteremia. She presented with sepsis but has improved overnight, weaned off pressors, and no fever spikes. The patient has multiple possible sources of infection including abdominal infection, colonitis due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff), thigh abscess, and central venous line infection. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids. Further investigations are planned, including identification of abscesses, daily blood cultures, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). The patient also has evidence of a hypercoagulable state with splenic infarcts, concern for autoimmune cholangiopathy with increased bilirubin levels, and uncontrolled type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including abdominal infection, colonitis due to C. diff, thigh abscess, and central venous line infection. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover these possible infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has impaired skin integrity and hypotension. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/79 to 151/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on TPN with lipids and receiving various medications including micafungin, meropenem, metronidazole, vancomycin, and heparin sodium. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes, but normal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a risk that the infection could progress and lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Skin infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing a skin infection, which could potentially become complicated if not properly managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability and could lead to complications such as organ perfusion issues or shock.
4. Medication complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and antifungals. There is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old female with ESRD on HD, Chronic HBV, on wound vac for
   abdominal wall abscess s/p exlap, closure of gastrostomy and peg
   removal, I&D abd wall abscess x3/necrotizing fascitis and recent
   E.Coli, [**Female First Name (un) **], and Pseudomonas bacteremia, with recent
   diagnosis/initiation of treatment for positive cdiff admitted for
   sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: Given multiple possible etiologies in woman with recent
   candidemia, pseudomonas (resistant to Zosyn), E coli bacteremia, and
   new leukocytosis in setting of multiple abx will attempt source control
   with broad antibiotics/antifungals at this time. Sources include cdiff
   with pancolitis vs line infection (high risk with TPN) vs cholangitis
   with increased Tbili vs right thigh abcess. No ascites on wet read of
   CT abd or exam to indicate SBP, no hypoxia or convincing new infiltrate
   on CXR to suggest PNA (has baseline atelectasis). Patient on levophed
   and s/p 2L fluid in ED.
   - PO vanco and IV flagyl for possible C diff
   - IV vancomycin, Fluconazole and meropenem to cover for possible line
   related infection vs cholangitis in setting of resistant bacteria in
   the past. IV vanco may need to be dosed at HD - received first dose in
   ED today
   - surgery following - consider whether need exploration of abdominal
   wound or I/D of thigh abcess with cultures
   - ID consult in AM
   - monitor serial lactate, 1.9 in ED
   - check stool C diff and cx, urine cx, blood cx from PICC, HD cath, and
   peripheral
   - levophed to maintain goal MAP>65 but try to wean down overnight
   - if remains on pressors, will likely need new triple lumen line and
   aline in AM
   - f/u final read CT abdomen
   - f/u BCx from ED
   - give dose hydrocortisone given recently on steroids
   - consider PC to r/o SBP
   .
   # HBV/autoimmune cholangiopathy: Patient with known HBV on treatment
   and autoimmune cholangiopathy in past. Bilis are increased from prior -
   up to Tbili 11.7. MELD 33 - on transplant list. s/p recent prednisone
   course (unclear end date)
   - liver consult in AM - patient's last 2 month course was on liver
   service
   - trend bili
   - continue ursodiol
   - continue tenofovir and entecavir
   .
   # Abdominal wall abcess: s/p complicated course with multiple I/D,
   debridements and multiple courses of antibiotics for resistant
   organisms. Was sent to rehab off antibiotics and on wound vac
   - surgery following, appreciate recs, discuss drainage of 2cm thigh
   fluid collection
   - keep NPO for now in case needs procedure
   - talk to surgery regarding recs on wound vac/whether plastics will
   need to be involved
   - broad spectrum antibiotics as above
   .
   # Cdiff: Per rehab was positive for cdiff and was on PO vanco after not
   tolerating flagyl [**2-2**] nausea. Patient has baseline diarrhea but at high
   risk [**2-2**] long courses of antibiotics from last hospital stay
   - maintain PO vanco and IV flagyl
   - send stool for cdiff for confirmation here
   - follow stool output
   .
   # DM. Has history of uncontrolled type II diabetes followed at [**Last Name (un) 294**].
   - continue current regimen of 10 units lantus qhs and Humolog SS.
   .
   # ESRD. The patient receives HD M/W/F at [**Hospital1 97**] via R
   tunnelled line. Patient has had infections in prior lines and last
   temp dialysis line was again removed [**2-24**] and grew pseudomonas,

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of ESRD, chronic HBV, and autoimmune cholangiopathy. She is currently admitted for sepsis and has multiple potential sources of infection including CDIF, line-related infection, cholangitis, and abdominal wall abscess. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. She is also on TPN and has a history of uncontrolled type II diabetes. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 148/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she requires close monitoring and further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to multiple possible etiologies. Immediate source control with broad antibiotics/antifungals is being attempted.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDIF): The patient has a positive stool culture for CDIF and is receiving PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
3. Line-related infection: The patient has had previous line infections, and her recent temporary dialysis line grew resistant bacteria. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and the HD line is being evaluated for infection.
4. Cholangitis: The patient's bilirubin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and recent prolonged hospitalization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement with subsequent abdominal wound infection. The patient was transferred to the ICU with suspected Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sepsis. She is currently hemodynamically stable, tolerating hemodialysis, and off vasopressors. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis likely due to C. diff, possible deep vein thrombosis with splenic infarcts, adrenal insufficiency, chronic HBV infection, abdominal wound infection, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis due to C. diff infection: The patient's current condition suggests that she has sepsis caused by C. diff infection. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals for a total of 48 hours if cultures remain negative.

2. Thrombosis with splenic infarcts: The presence of diminished pulses in the lower extremities and the potential for a thigh abscess suggests a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with associated splenic infarcts. Further evaluation and management are required.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is currently on hydrocortisone 50 q"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and uncontrolled type II diabetes. She was admitted with necrotizing fasciitis, E. coli and Pseudomonas bacteremia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and sepsis. The patient underwent several surgeries, including the removal of an abdominal wall abscess and closure of a gastrostomy site.

Current Condition:
The patient is now off of pressors and hemodynamically stable. Her diarrhea has markedly improved, and she is showing signs of recovery. However, she still has a wound vac in place for an abdominal wall abscess, and her blood cultures are pending. The patient's bilateral upper extremity clots were identified, with an older left brachial clot. It was decided not to anticoagulate her at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercoagulable state/evidence of emboli: The patient has evidence of emboli and a possible hypercoagulable state. She has new splenic infarcts, and upper extremity ultrasound showed a right internal jugular (IJ) clot and an older left brachial clot. It is important to monitor for any further clot formation and consider appropriate management.
2. Chronic HBV infection: The patient has known HBV infection and autoimmune cholangiopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with no known drug allergies. He was called out of the ET due to concerns about infections and exposure to transplant patients. The patient has had several events over the past 24 hours, including improvement in diarrhea, negative LENIs, aspiration of fluid collection in the left thigh, bilateral upper extremity clots, and initiation of clears. The patient's blood pressure remains stable off of pressors, and low vancomycin trough levels were noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's exposure to transplant patients raises concerns for potential infections. The aspiration of fluid collection in the left thigh and negative LENIs indicate that further evaluation for infection is necessary.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of bilateral upper extremity clots suggests a potential risk for DVT. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent complications such as pulmonary embolism.

3. Coagulation Abnormalities: The elevated PT/PTT/INR levels indicate coagulation abnormalities. This may require close monitoring and adjustment of anticoagulation therapy to prevent bleeding or clotting complications.

4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance over the past 24 hours. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to avoid fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

5. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating. It is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including ESRD, chronic HBV, wound vac for abdominal wall abscess, previous laparotomy, and necrotizing fasciitis. She has a history of recent E. coli and Pseudomonas bacteremia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was admitted with sepsis but is now hemodynamically stable and off of pressors. She has bilateral upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), an abdominal wall abscess, and evidence of emboli. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple possible etiologies for infection including abdominal infection, colitis due to Clostridium difficile, thigh abscess, and line infection. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of sepsis recurrence.
2. Upper Extremity DVTs: The patient has right internal jugular vein clot and an older left brachial artery clot. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent complications associated with DVTs such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Abdominal Wall Abscess: The patient has a history of complicated abdominal wall abscess requiring multiple incision and drainage procedures. Close monitoring and surgical consultation are needed to address this issue.
4. Hypercoagulable State: The patient has evidence of emboli and new splenic infarcts, raising concern for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent abdominal infection, and complicated by hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU with the following conditions: sepsis (improving), adrenal insufficiency, upper extremity clots, hepatitis B-related colopathy, abdominal wound, and ongoing treatment for ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been improving but still requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: Tapering off hydrocortisone and discussing with the liver service regarding glucocorticoid needs for possible autoimmune colitis.
3. Upper extremity clots: These do not appear acute, so systemic anticoagulation may not be necessary. However, further evaluation is needed to determine the appropriate course of action.
4. HBV colopathy: Follow-up with the liver service and continue antiviral therapy.
5. Abdominal wound: Continue vacuum dressing.
6. FEN (likely referring to fluid overload or fluid management): Continue total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and adat (likely referring to a medication or treatment).
7. ESRD: Continue with hemodialysis treatment.
8. HTN (hypertension): Restart home blood pressure regimen if the patient remains normotensive post-HD.

   2. Adrenal insufficiency:
    - taper hydrocort: 50 Q 8 today then [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow
    - will discuss with liver service regarding GC needs for possible
   autoimmune colitis
   3. Upper extremity clots:
    - do not appear acute, will hold off on systemic a/c.  Not involving
   picc so will keep picc
   4. HBV colopathy: f/u with liver service, continue antivirals
   5. Abdominal wound: cont vac dressing

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, recent abdominal infection, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She presented to the hospital with hypotension secondary to C. diff colitis. The patient's condition has been improving, and she has been hemodynamically stable. 

24-hour events include the placement of upper extremity dopplers which revealed a right internal jugular vein (IJV) clot and left brachial artery clot. A vacuum dressing was also placed. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and she is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, proton pump inhibitors, and heparin.

The patient's physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities except for diminished pulses in both lower extremities, edema in the lower extremities, and muscle wasting. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main concerns include sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, upper extremity clots, hepatitis B-related colopathy, abdominal wound, fluid-electrolyte imbalance, and hypertension. Treatment plans include discontinuing certain antibiotics, tapering hydrocortisone, managing the abdominal wound, continuing total parenteral nutrition (TP"
