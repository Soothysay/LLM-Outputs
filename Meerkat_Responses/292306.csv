   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of likely CAP
   .
   # Dyspnea:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in setting
   of known HTN, with overlying CAP.  Pt quite hypertensive upon arrival
   to CCU, very anxious, with labored breathing.  No diastolic murmur
   noted on exam, but given history, must also consider prosthetic valve
   endocarditis.  Suspect that patient is not preload dependent.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off yesterday
   -  lasix 80 mg IV x 1 with metolazone 2.5 mg PO x 1, with goal (-) 1 to
   2 liters overnight -> little response, will defer additional diuretic
   therapy as pt now appears euvolemic, and worsening renal function
   likely pre-renal in etiology
   -  will give lisinopril, coreg, amlodipine tonight, hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting
   of aggressive diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen
   except for ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and hydralazine with good BP
   control
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, most likely [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   -  will obtain non-contrast chest CT this morning, cont to renally dose
   levofloxacin and ceftriaxone
   -  will follow up blood culture and send urine culture to further eval
   leukocytosis; likely [**2-8**] CAP
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland sediment
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound
   - strict Is/Os
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**]
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   -  will cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs yesterday with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, will start
   iron today

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient has known hypertension and flash pulmonary edema, which suggests diastolic dysfunction. This condition can lead to congestive heart failure if not managed properly.

2. Prosthetic valve endocarditis: The patient's history of aortic valve replacement and the presentation of acute onset shortness of breath raise suspicion for prosthetic valve endocarditis. This condition can lead to serious complications such as septic emboli or heart failure.

3. Multifocal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and oxygen requirement suggest an underlying respiratory infection. The presence of leukocytosis further supports the possibility of pneumonia.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and the recent development of anemia and bland sediment suggests worsening renal function. This condition can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.

5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of mild CAD from a previous cardiac catheterization. This condition increases the risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction.

6. Iron-deficiency anemia: The patient's low iron studies suggest the possibility of iron-deficiency anemia. This condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen carrying capacity.

7. Type II diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes, which"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR) complicated by prosthetic valve endocarditis. He presented with acute onset shortness of breath and was found to have flash pulmonary edema, likely due to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's initial presentation included severe hypertension, anxiety, and labored breathing. There was no diastolic murmur noted on examination, but given the patient's history, prosthetic valve endocarditis must also be considered. 

The patient was started on nitroglycerin infusion immediately upon arrival to the critical care unit (CCU), which resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure from 220s to 170s-180s and improved dyspnea. Nitroglycerin was weaned off the previous day. Lasix 80 mg IV and metolazone 2.5 mg PO were given overnight with the goal of removing 1 to 2 liters of fluid, but there was little response. Additional diuretic therapy was deferred as the patient now appears euvolemic, and worsening renal function is likely pre-renal in etiology. 

The patient will receive lisinopril, coreg, and amlodipine tonight, and hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] in the setting of aggressive"

","Summary:
The patient presents with dyspnea and is admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes aortic valve homograft, for which they have mild LVH with normal LVEF. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin and antibiotics (ceftriaxone and levo). They experienced systolic hypertension and received 2 units of PRBCs with good response. The patient's renal function is being assessed due to concerns of renal failure. They have trace AR and trace MR on TTE. The patient is anxious but denies fevers, chills, chest pain, or pressure. They have non-productive dry cough and improving dyspnea. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for agitated behavior.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output indicate potential renal dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary edema: The presence of crackles on lung auscultation and dullness at the right lung base suggest fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Right heart failure (cor pulmonale): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and findings of peripheral edema may indicate right-sided heart failure.
4. Infective endocarditis: The patient's history of aortic valve homograft increases the risk for infective endocarditis. Although not explicitly mentioned, the presence of fever, new murmur, and positive blood cultures would be concerning for this condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of likely CAP
   .
   # Dyspnea:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in setting
   of known HTN, with overlying CAP.  Pt quite hypertensive upon arrival
   to CCU, very anxious, with labored breathing.  No diastolic murmur
   noted on exam, but given history, must also consider prosthetic valve
   endocarditis.  Suspect that patient is not preload dependent.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off yesterday
   -  lasix 80 mg IV x 1 with metolazone 2.5 mg PO x 1, with goal (-) 1 to
   2 liters overnight -> little response, will defer additional diuretic
   therapy as pt now appears euvolemic, and worsening renal function
   likely pre-renal in etiology
   -  will give lisinopril, coreg, amlodipine tonight, hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting
   of aggressive diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen
   except for ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and hydralazine with good BP
   control
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, most likely [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   -  will obtain non-contrast chest CT this morning, cont to renally dose
   levofloxacin and ceftriaxone
   -  will follow up blood culture and send urine culture to further eval
   leukocytosis; likely [**2-8**] CAP
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland sediment
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound
   - strict Is/Os
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**]
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   -  will cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry
   .

   Additional comments:
   Volume status remains a little unclear. There is JVD - approximately 15
   mm hg
   Will proceed with a right heart cath and central aortic pressure to
   help distinguish chf , intravascular volume status
   In regard to lung pathology - blood vs infection. wbc is rising
   Will proceed with a non contrast CT of the chest. Will also look at the
   abdomen because of inability to
   visualize one of the kidneys by ultrasound.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve who underwent an aortic valve replacement. He presented to the ICU with acute onset shortness of breath, which is consistent with flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and oxygen requirement, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) in the setting of known hypertension and possible CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). The patient was hypertensive upon arrival, but nitroglycerin helped to control the blood pressure. Lasix and metolazone were given to address fluid overload, but with little response. The patient's renal function is worsening, suggesting pre-renal etiology. 

Plan:
- Obtain a non-contrast chest CT to evaluate for multifocal CAP.
- Continue to aggressively diurese the patient.
- Renally dose levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
- Follow up blood cultures and send urine culture for further evaluation of leukocytosis, likely due to CAP.
- Strict I/Os and check urine lytes.
- Perform a renal ultrasound and follow up with a nephrologist.
- Continue ASA, statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor as previously prescribed.
- Cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia.
- TTE shows mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve.
- Consider the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented to the ICU with acute onset shortness of breath (dyspnea) and was found to have flash pulmonary edema. The patient has a known history of hypertension and is suspected to have acute decompensated heart failure with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's initial presentation included severe hypertension, anxiety, and labored breathing. After being started on nitroglycerin, the patient's blood pressure improved significantly, and there was a noticeable decrease in dyspnea. The patient's renal function is worsening, likely due to pre-renal causes. The patient's current medications include lisinopril, coreg, amlodipine, imdur, and hydralazine for blood pressure control, as well as continuing treatment for acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is also being monitored for possible prosthetic valve endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated heart failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and flash pulmonary edema suggest acute decompensated heart failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and respiratory distress if not properly managed.
2. Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Given the patient's history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent AVR, there is a possibility of prosthetic valve end"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on September 23rd, where a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 17 was reported. The patient experienced increased dyspnea overnight with anxiety/panic, and hydralazine was increased. Nitroglycerin was restarted for systolic blood pressure in the 160s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.48, PaCO2 32, PaO2 69, and oxygen saturation improved with 5 liters of oxygen. A chest X-ray revealed worsening patchy infiltrates, particularly at the right base. A CT scan of the chest indicated extensive bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage with possible underlying infection or mass. There were no additional sources of acute process or infection identified in the abdomen or pelvis. The patient's renal artery waveforms were nondiagnostic, with a normal appearance and size of both kidneys. Mild benign prostatic hyperplasia was noted. The patient's allergies include Ativan (Lorazepam) and Morphine, both causing delirium. The last doses of antibiotics were Levofloxacin at 01:44 PM on September 23rd and Ceftriaxone at 04:00 PM on September 23rd. The patient is currently receiving nitroglycerin at 1 mcg/kg/min, and heparin"

   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of likely CAP
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  No diastolic murmur noted on exam, but given history, must
   also consider prosthetic valve endocarditis.  Suspect that patient is
   not preload dependent.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off, then restarted yesterday, will
   wean again today
   - goal SBP 130s-140s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response, will defer additional
   diuretic therapy as pt now appears euvolemic to slightly hypervolemic
   with wedge of 17 mmHg
   -  will give lisinopril, coreg, amlodipine, hold [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of
   aggressive diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except
   for ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> nitro gtt
   restarted, Hydralazine increased, will wean nitro gtt this AM
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, most likely [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   vs. viral (?influenza) vs. pulmonary hemorrhage (less likely) -> ?
   bronchoscopy to assist with diagnosis of lung pathology
   -  non-contrast chest CT as above, will await final read, cont to
   renally dose levofloxacin and ceftriaxone
   -  will follow up blood culture and send urine culture to further eval
   leukocytosis, which is improving
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland sediment
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr continues to rise, ? lasix, levofloxacin renal toxicity/pre-renal
   in setting of likely chronic hypertensive glomerulosclerosis
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**]
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   -  will cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC yesterday
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs yesterday with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, will start
   iron today
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Cardiac Complications:
- The patient has a history of biscupid aortic valve and underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2187**]. There is a possibility of prosthetic valve endocarditis, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
- The patient's blood pressure is consistently high, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This may contribute to diastolic dysfunction and increase the risk of heart failure.
- The patient's ejection fraction is preserved, but there is evidence of mild diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). These findings suggest that the patient's heart function may be compromised.

2. Pulmonary Complications:
- The patient presented with acute onset shortness of breath and is experiencing flash pulmonary edema. This indicates acute respiratory distress and possible fluid overload.
- The patient has worsening patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray and a CT chest indicating extensive bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage with possible underlying infection or mass. These findings suggest the possibility of pneumonia or another pulmonary infection.
- The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has an increased respiratory rate, indicating respiratory distress.

3. Renal Complications:
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal with bland sediment. This suggests impaired kidney function.
- The patient's serum creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function.
- There is a concern for pre-"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve, who underwent an aortic valve replacement in [**2187**]. He presented to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath and was found to have flash pulmonary edema. He also has worsening patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible underlying infection or mass. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving various treatments for his symptoms, including nitroglycerin, Lasix, metolazone, lisinopril, Coreg, amlodipine, and Hydralazine. Despite these interventions, the patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement continue, indicating possible multifocal community-acquired pneumonia or viral infection. A non-contrast chest CT has been ordered to further evaluate the lung pathology. The patient's blood cultures and urine culture have also been sent to assess for any potential infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's known history of hypertension and prosthetic valve endocarditis raise concerns about diastolic dysfunction. This can be caused by impaired relaxation or compliance of the ventricles, leading to increased filling pressures and symptoms such as dyspnea.
2. Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Given the patient's history of valve replacement surgery, there is a possibility of prosthetic valve endocarditis, which can present with signs and symptoms of infection, including fever,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent aortic valve replacement (AVR). He presented with acute onset shortness of breath and is suspected to have flash pulmonary edema. The patient also has worsening patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray and a CT chest indicating extensive bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage with possible underlying infection or mass.

The patient's vital signs show hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated creatinine, and leukocytosis. The patient's blood cultures and urine culture have been sent for further evaluation. He is currently receiving nitroglycerin, heparin sodium, hydralazine, lisinopril, metoprolol, and amlodipine for his medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Given the patient's history of AVR, there is a possibility of prosthetic valve endocarditis, which needs to be considered and ruled out.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction, which may be acute on chronic renal failure.
3. Multifocal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings indicate a possible diagnosis of CAP, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
4. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The CT chest findings suggest extensive bilateral"

   Final CT chest:
   1. Diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated
   fissural fluid and pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate
   on the left side, favoring pulmonary edema with superimposed infection.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.
   2. No additional source of infection or acute process identified in the

   ID recommended:
   - TEE to evaluate for endocarditis, especially in setting of recent
   detal work which preceded the symptoms.
   - Would favor bronchoscopy for diagnosis of possible infectious process
   and would send BAL fluid for the following:
   * bacterial cx, anaerobic cx, fungal stains and cx, viral cx, AFB smear
   and culture, legionella antigen, CMV shell vial cx, PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Agree with nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral antigens.
   - If no bronch than would recommend induced sputum for the above.
   - Would continue current antibiotic cover with ceftriaxone and
   levofloxacin which will give good coverage for gram positive, gram
   negative as well as atypical bacterial organisms.
   - If there are gram positive cocci on either a sputum specimen or the
   BAL specimen, then would broaden with vancomycin for possible MRSA,

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of possible infection, ? CAP
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  No diastolic murmur noted on exam, but given history, must
   also consider prosthetic valve endocarditis.  Suspect that patient is
   not preload dependent.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off, then restarted yesterday, and
   has been continued over past 24 hours
   - goal SBP 130s-140s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response, although Is/Os still even
   over 24 hours; deferred further diuresis overnight in light of lytes
   (Hyponatremia), worsening renal function
   - will attemp further diuresis today with goal 1L neg
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> nitro gtt restarted,
   Hydralazine and imdur increased
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, possibly [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   vs. viral (?influenza) vs. pulmonary hemorrhage (less likely) -> ?
   bronchoscopy to assist with diagnosis of lung pathology, however pt is
   very reluctant, and question diagnostic yield at this point
   -  will follow up blood culture and send urine culture to further eval
   leukocytosis, which is improving; blood cultures drawn at PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office
   prior to admission are (-)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland
   sediment, although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and pt has preserved
   systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic hypertensive
   glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr continues to rise despite improved diuresis yesterday
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**]
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   -  will cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia, and repeat if pt
   becomes acutely SOB
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs yesterday with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, will start
   iron today
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable
   .
   # Type II DM - lantus and SS [**Last Name (LF) 10263**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt's home sliding scale
   -  increased basal and SS insulin today for better control

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been diagnosed with dyspnea and oxygen requirement, possibly due to diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, and potential underlying pulmonary infection.

The patient's initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 220s, which was successfully lowered to 170s-180s with the administration of nitroglycerin. The patient was also started on lasix and diuril, resulting in an improved response. However, further diuresis was deferred due to hyponatremia and worsening renal function.

The patient's respiratory support includes an O2 delivery device (nasal cannula) with SpO2 at 95%. ABG results are as follows: ///18/. Physical examination reveals crackles on auscultation of the chest, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin.

Laboratory findings include elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with acute onset shortness of breath and flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

The patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement continue, possibly due to multifocal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or viral infection. There is also a concern for pulmonary hemorrhage, but it is less likely. The physician plans to perform a bronchoscopy to assist with the diagnosis of lung pathology, although the patient is reluctant and the diagnostic yield is uncertain.

The patient has worsening renal failure, likely pre-renal with bland sediment, and appears to be eu-hypervolemic. The physician suspects significant chronic hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and plans to check urine electrolytes, follow up renal ultrasound, and maintain strict Is/Os.

The patient has mild coronary artery disease from a previous cardiac catheterization. The physician will continue the current cardiac medications and repeat cardiac markers to rule out ischemia.

The patient has mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve. The physician plans to treat acute diastolic dysfunction and obtain full results of right heart catheterization, which showed elevated left and right-sided filling pressures and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The patient is in sinus rhythm with evidence of"

   Second episode of hypertension, SBP 180s overnight, with anxiety/panic,
   nitro gtt restarted, received xanax to good effect.  Goal (-) one liter
   today via lasix and diuril.
   Final CT chest:
   1. Diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated
   fissural fluid and pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate
   on the left side, favoring pulmonary edema with superimposed infection.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.
   2. No additional source of infection or acute process identified in the
   abdomen or pelvis.
   Discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**], he agreed to defer bronchoscopy today,
   will not change management, revisit tomorrow.
   ID recommended:
   - TEE to evaluate for endocarditis, especially in setting of recent
   detal work which preceded the symptoms.
   - Would favor bronchoscopy for diagnosis of possible infectious process
   and would send BAL fluid for the following:
   * bacterial cx, anaerobic cx, fungal stains and cx, viral cx, AFB smear
   and culture, legionella antigen, CMV shell vial cx, PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Agree with nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral antigens.
   - If no bronch than would recommend induced sputum for the above.
   - Would continue current antibiotic cover with ceftriaxone and
   levofloxacin which will give good coverage for gram positive, gram
   negative as well as atypical bacterial organisms.
   - If there are gram positive cocci on either a sputum specimen or the
   BAL specimen, then would broaden with vancomycin for possible MRSA,
   although wouldn't empirically add it at this time

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve and previous prosthetic valve endocarditis who presented with acute onset shortness of breath and hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with flash pulmonary edema and is suspected to have community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypertension. He has also been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. The patient's renal function has worsened, showing signs of acute on chronic renal failure. Other medical conditions include type II diabetes mellitus, depression/anxiety, gout, and mild coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Given the patient's history of previous endocarditis, there is a possibility of prosthetic valve endocarditis, which can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, embolic events, and septicemia.
2. Pulmonary infection: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and crackles in the lungs suggest a pulmonary infection, which can progress to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not treated promptly.
3. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's history of hypertension and known diastolic dysfunction may worsen during episodes of increased blood pressure, leading to further cardiac complications.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, indicating possible AKI. This could be"

   today via lasix and diuril.
   Final CT chest:
   1. Diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated
   fissural fluid and pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate
   on the left side, favoring pulmonary edema with superimposed infection.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.
   2. No additional source of infection or acute process identified in the
   abdomen or pelvis.
   Discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**], he agreed to defer bronchoscopy today,
   will not change management, revisit tomorrow.
   ID recommended:
   - TEE to evaluate for endocarditis, especially in setting of recent
   detal work which preceded the symptoms.
   - Would favor bronchoscopy for diagnosis of possible infectious process
   and would send BAL fluid for the following:
   * bacterial cx, anaerobic cx, fungal stains and cx, viral cx, AFB smear
   and culture, legionella antigen, CMV shell vial cx, PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Agree with nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral antigens.
   - If no bronch than would recommend induced sputum for the above.
   - Would continue current antibiotic cover with ceftriaxone and
   levofloxacin which will give good coverage for gram positive, gram
   negative as well as atypical bacterial organisms.
   - If there are gram positive cocci on either a sputum specimen or the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with dyspnea and was found to have diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated fissural fluid and pleural effusions on CT chest. The findings are suggestive of pulmonary edema with superimposed infection, and pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be ruled out. The patient also had a second episode of hypertension, which was managed with nitro gtt and Xanax. A bladder scan showed more than 400 cc of urine retention. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated fissural fluid and pleural effusions indicates pulmonary edema. This condition is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The CT chest findings suggest a possible superimposed infection on the pulmonary edema. The patient's elevated white blood cell count supports this possibility. A bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis have been recommended to identify the causative organism.
3. Hypertension: The patient experienced two episodes of hypertension overnight, with blood pressure readings of 180s. It is essential to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent complications such as cardiac strain or organ damage.
4. Urinary Retention: The bladder scan revealed more than 400 cc of urine retention. This can be attributed to the patient's critical condition and immobilization in the ICU. Timely intervention"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and medications.

Summary:
- The patient has a history of anxiety and hypertension, which are currently being managed in the ICU.
- The patient presented with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and improving respiratory status.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 120/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals crackles in the right base of the lungs and peripheral edema in both lower extremities.
- Lab results show elevated blood glucose levels, decreased hematocrit, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels.
- The patient is receiving multiple IV infusions and has undergone several blood cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of crackles in the right base of the lungs suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be caused by heart failure or fluid overload.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The decreased urine output (bladder scan > 400 cc) and elevated creatinine levels indicate potential acute kidney injury, possibly due to renal hypoperfusion or sepsis.
3. Hyperglycemia: The consistently high blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of possible infection, ? CAP
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  No diastolic murmur noted on exam, but given history, must
   also consider prosthetic valve endocarditis.  Suspect that patient is
   not preload dependent.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off, then restarted yesterday, and
   has been continued over past 24 hours
   - goal SBP 130s-140s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response, although Is/Os still even
   over 24 hours; deferred further diuresis overnight in light of lytes
   (Hyponatremia), worsening renal function
   - will attemp further diuresis today with goal 1L neg
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> nitro gtt restarted,
   Hydralazine and imdur increased
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, possibly [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   vs. viral (?influenza) vs. pulmonary hemorrhage (less likely) -> ?
   bronchoscopy to assist with diagnosis of lung pathology, however pt is
   very reluctant, and question diagnostic yield at this point
   -  will follow up blood culture and send urine culture to further eval
   leukocytosis, which is improving; blood cultures drawn at PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office
   prior to admission are (-)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland
   sediment, although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and pt has preserved
   systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic hypertensive
   glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr continues to rise despite improved diuresis yesterday
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**]
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   -  will cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia, and repeat if pt
   becomes acutely SOB
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs yesterday with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, will start
   iron today
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable
   .
   # Type II DM - lantus and SS [**Last Name (LF) 10263**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt's home sliding scale
   -  increased basal and SS insulin today for better control
   .
   # h/o depression/anxiety - stable, cont fluoxetine

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Date and time of visit was 9/20/9 at 10:30am
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 391**] [**Name (NI) **], MD
   on:[**2196-9-26**] 12:54 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent aortic valve replacement (AVR) who presented with acute onset shortness of breath and flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, possible CAP (community-acquired pneumonia), and worsening renal function.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with possible CAP, which can lead to complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and oxygen requirement suggest that he may have developed pulmonary edema. If left untreated, this condition can progress to respiratory failure.

3. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This can lead to further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he has required aggressive diuresis to manage his fluid status. Hypotension can lead to organ perfusion issues and potential shock.

5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and positive blood cultures suggest an ongoing infection. If not appropriately managed, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock"

   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2196-9-25**] 03:35 AM
   bladder scan this morning > 400 cc
   Second episode of hypertension, SBP 180s overnight, with anxiety/panic,
   nitro gtt restarted, received xanax to good effect.  Goal (-) one liter
   today via lasix and diuril.
   Final CT chest:
   1. Diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated
   fissural fluid and pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate
   on the left side, favoring pulmonary edema with superimposed infection.
   Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.
   2. No additional source of infection or acute process identified in the
   abdomen or pelvis.
   Discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33**], he agreed to defer bronchoscopy today,
   will not change management, revisit tomorrow.
   ID recommended:
   - TEE to evaluate for endocarditis, especially in setting of recent
   detal work which preceded the symptoms.
   - Would favor bronchoscopy for diagnosis of possible infectious process
   and would send BAL fluid for the following:
   * bacterial cx, anaerobic cx, fungal stains and cx, viral cx, AFB smear
   and culture, legionella antigen, CMV shell vial cx, PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Agree with nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral antigens.
   - If no bronch than would recommend induced sputum for the above.
   - Would continue current antibiotic cover with ceftriaxone and
   levofloxacin which will give good coverage for gram positive, gram
   negative as well as atypical bacterial organisms.
   - If there are gram positive cocci on either a sputum specimen or the
   BAL specimen, then would broaden with vancomycin for possible MRSA,
   although wouldn't empirically add it at this time
   repeat lytes concerning for AG met acidosis, delta-delta suggests
   possible overlying non-gap met acidosis, all likely [**2-8**] worsening renal
   failure; pt also developing hyponatremia -> deferred further diuresis

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement, presenting with acute onset shortness of breath and possible flash pulmonary edema. The patient is experiencing dyspnea and oxygen requirement, with possible underlying infection such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and there is concern for diastolic dysfunction and prosthetic valve endocarditis. The patient has been started on nitroglycerin to manage blood pressure and improve symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement, along with the acute onset of shortness of breath, suggests the possibility of diastolic dysfunction. This can lead to impaired filling of the heart during diastole, reducing cardiac output and causing symptoms such as dyspnea.
2. Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of aortic valve replacement and the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis. This condition can lead to infection of the prosthetic valve, causing symptoms like fever, fatigue, and signs of heart failure.
3. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and oxygen requirement may indicate an underlying respiratory infection, such as CAP. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially complications like se"

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR) complicated by prosthetic valve endocarditis. He presented to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath and was found to have flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events:
- Blood cultures were drawn at 03:35 AM.
- The patient had a second episode of hypertension with a blood pressure of 180s overnight, accompanied by anxiety and panic. Nitroglycerin was restarted, and Xanax was given, which had a good effect.
- The patient received Lasix and Diuril to manage fluid overload and hypertension. However, this led to hyponatremia, so further diuresis was deferred.
- A CT chest was performed, revealing diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated fissural fluid and pleural effusions, suggestive of pulmonary edema with superimposed infection. Pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.
- There were no additional sources of infection or acute processes identified in the abdomen or pelvis.
- A discussion regarding bronchoscopy was held, and it was agreed to defer the procedure for now, as it would not change the management plan. The patient's ID recommended performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate for endocarditis, especially considering the recent dental work."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of possible infection, ? CAP
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  No diastolic murmur noted on exam, but given history, must
   also consider prosthetic valve endocarditis.  Suspect that patient is
   not preload dependent.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off, then restarted yesterday, and
   has been continued over past 24 hours
   - goal SBP 130s-140s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response, although Is/Os still even
   over 24 hours; deferred further diuresis overnight in light of lytes
   (Hyponatremia), worsening renal function
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> nitro gtt restarted,
   Hydralazine and imdur increased
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, possibly [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   vs. viral (?influenza) vs. pulmonary hemorrhage (less likely) -> ?
   bronchoscopy to assist with diagnosis of lung pathology, however pt is
   very reluctant, and question diagnostic yield at this point
   -  will follow up blood culture and send urine culture to further eval
   leukocytosis, which is improving; blood cultures drawn at PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] office
   prior to admission are (-)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland
   sediment, although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and pt has preserved
   systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic hypertensive
   glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr continues to rise despite improved diuresis yesterday
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**]
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   -  will cycle cardiac markers to rule out ischemia, and repeat if pt
   becomes acutely SOB
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs yesterday with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, will start
   iron today
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable
   .
   # Type II DM - lantus and SS [**Last Name (LF) 10263**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt's home sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement who presented with acute onset shortness of breath, likely due to flash pulmonary edema. He has been experiencing dyspnea and oxygen requirement, possibly in the setting of possible community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure is very high, and he has signs of acute on chronic renal failure with bland sediment and preserved systolic function. He also has mild coronary artery disease, mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve. The patient is in sinus rhythm but has evidence of interventricular conduction delay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and oxygen requirement suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be confirmed through further diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or CT scan.
2. Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement, there is a concern for prosthetic valve endocarditis. Blood cultures and echocardiography may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and oxygen requirement could also be attributed to CAP. Diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or sputum culture may be required to confirm this diagnosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments including nitro drip, renal replacement therapy (RRT), diuretics, and antibiotics. Despite these interventions, the patient's renal function continues to decline, and there are concerns about bronchospasm outweighing the benefits of continuing the nitro drip. The patient's current vital signs show stable heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. However, the patient is experiencing hyperglycemia, anxiety, hypertension, dyspnea, acute renal failure, right heart failure, pulmonary edema, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, increased creatinine levels, elevated troponin T, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes and arterial blood gas values are also provided. The patient is currently receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing pneumonia. This condition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's declining renal function and elevated creatinine levels suggest ongoing renal impairment. If not managed appropriately, AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.
4. Right heart failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and pulmonary edema, along with the findings of elevated right atrial pressure and pulmonary congestion, indicate possible right heart failure. This condition may worsen over time if not treated promptly.
5. Bronchospasm: The patient's history of asthma and the current use of nitro drip increase the risk of bronchospasm, which can compromise respiratory function and oxygenation.
6. Sepsis: Despite the administration of antibiotics, the patient's ongoing infection and inflammatory markers suggest the possibility of persistent sepsis. Continued vigilance is necessary to monitor and manage this condition effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement continues in setting of possible infection versus pulm
   edema versus pulm hemorrhage.
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  Chest imaging concerning for edema vs infection vs
   hemorrhage.  Respiratory status now improving.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro was weaned off.
   - goal SBP 130s-140s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response
   - bumex and diuril -> better response
   - will continue diuresis today with bumex and diuril, goal 1L neg
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> nitro gtt restarted,
   Hydralazine and imdur increased
   -  O2 requirement and dyspnea continues, possibly [**2-8**] multifocal CAP
   vs. viral (?influenza) vs. pulmonary hemorrhage (less likely) -> per
   pulm, bronchoscopy risks would outweigh benefits at this point
   -  ID following, recs appreciated.  Will continue levo and ceftriaxone
   for now.
   - f/u cultures, induced sputum
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely pre-renal with bland
   sediment, although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and pt has preserved
   systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic hypertensive
   glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr continues to rise despite improved diuresis yesterday
   .
   # HTN : will continue regimen as above. Currently good BP control.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**], no evidence of MI
   currently.  CE neg.
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade and ACEi as above
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs yesterday with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, will start
   iron today
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10286**].
   I would add the following remarks:

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2187**]. He presented to the floor with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB), which was complicated by prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring a redo AVR. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's current symptoms include dyspnea and oxygen requirement, which are still present. The differential diagnosis includes possible infection versus pulmonary edema versus pulmonary hemorrhage. The chest imaging is concerning for edema, infection, or hemorrhage. The respiratory status has shown improvement after starting nitroglycerin (nitro) and diuretics.

The patient's renal function is declining, with a rise in serum creatinine levels. There is concern for acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal with bland sediment. The patient appears euvolemic and has preserved systolic function. Chronic hypertensive glomerulosclerosis is suspected.

The patient has a history of hypertension, and the blood pressure is well-controlled. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is present, but no evidence of myocardial infarction (MI) currently. A cardiac echo suggests mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve.

The patient also has mild anemia, possibly due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve, who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2187**]. He presented to the floor with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and was subsequently transferred to the ICU due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement continue, with concerns of possible infection, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Initially thought to be diastolic dysfunction secondary to known hypertension, with possible overlying pulmonary infection. Respiratory status has improved after nitro drip, but the patient remains hypertensive and anxious with labored breathing. Goal blood pressure is 130s-140s. Diuretics (Lasix, Diuril, Bumex) have been initiated to achieve negative fluid balance of 1L.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pre-renal with bland sediment. Strict intake/output monitoring is ongoing. Renal recommendations are appreciated, and urine electrolytes, follow-up renal ultrasound, and strict medication compliance are advised.
3. Hypertension: The current antihypertensive regimen will be continued, including Coreg, amlodipine, and Hydralazine. Nitro drip was restarted, and imdur and Hydralazine doses were increased.
4. Infection: O2 requirement and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent replacement with an artificial valve. He presented to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath and was found to have flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been in the ICU since then, where he has been treated for various medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has been declining, as indicated by rising serum creatinine levels. There is evidence of pre-renal azotemia, but the patient appears to be eu-hypervolemic. The likely cause is chronic hypertensive glomerulosclerosis.
2. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive, with blood pressures in the range of 170s-180s. This may be due to diastolic dysfunction and may require further management.
3. Dyspnea and oxygen requirement: Despite initial improvement with nitro drip, the patient continues to experience dyspnea and requires supplemental oxygen. The cause is uncertain but could be multifocal community-acquired pneumonia, viral infection, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
4. Coronaries: The patient has mild coronary artery disease, for which he is already on aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapy.
5. Pump dysfunction: The patient has mild diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. This could be due to progressive left ventricular hypertrophy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU with a history of recent hospitalization and multiple comorbidities, including heart failure, pulmonary edema, renal failure, anxiety, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.
- The patient has been on a nitro drip, which was stopped at noon. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is being considered due to declining renal function.
- The patient received lasix 200 IV and diuril 500 IV in the morning, resulting in 500 cc urine output. In the evening, they received bumex 2 mg IV and diuril 500 IV, resulting in 1100 cc urine output overnight.
- The patient reports feeling somewhat improved in their breathing but still has a nonproductive cough. They are anxious about the possibility of dialysis.
- The patient has allergies to Ativan and morphine, both of which can cause delirium.
- Antibiotics were administered on 09/25/2196 at 03:52 PM.
- The patient is on various medications including furosemide (lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements in breathing.
- Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support.
- Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, thin build, and presence of crackles in the lungs with diminished breath sounds.
- The patient has trace edema in the lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic assessment.
- Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating between 11.8 and 18.0 thousand/mm3.
- Other lab values show elevated glucose levels, increased TCO2, and elevated troponin T levels.
- Assessment and plan include hyperglycemia, anxiety, hypertension, acute renal failure, isolated right heart failure (cor pulmonale), pulmonary edema, and ICU care.
- The patient has a code status of full code and their disposition is unknown.

   Disposition:
","The patient presents with dyspnea and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes anxiety, hypertension, and a history of renal failure. The patient's current vital signs show a blood pressure of 144/41 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema, as well as bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. The patient's labs indicate hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and acute kidney injury. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, exacerbation of heart failure, and potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of the patient's fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function is necessary. The patient's edema suggests fluid overload, and the crackles on lung auscultation may indicate pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure. It is important to assess and manage the patient's glycemic control, as well as provide appropriate pain management."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10286**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   date of service was 9/22/9 at 10:30am. Critically ill due to hypoxia,
   acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, renal failure, pneumonia.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 391**] [**Name (NI) **], MD
   on:[**2196-9-28**] 09:16 ------
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve who presented with acute onset shortness of breath, chest pain, and hypoxia. He has undergone redo aortic valve replacement due to prosthetic valve endocarditis. 

The patient's current condition is improving, with decreasing oxygen requirement and dyspnea. His blood pressure is under control, but he still requires diuretics for fluid management. 

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's known history of hypertension and recent presentation suggest possible diastolic dysfunction. This can be managed with nitroglycerin and diuretics as mentioned in the note.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are concerning for pulmonary edema. Diuretics and nitroglycerin have been initiated to improve his respiratory status.

3. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics for possible infection, and it is mentioned that the cultures are negative so far. However, the possibility of underlying infection should be considered and appropriate cultures and sensitivity tests should be continued.

4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has chronic renal failure and is currently managed with diuretics. Monitoring urine output, electrolytes, and renal function is crucial in this case.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has mild CAD from a previous catheterization. Regular monitoring of cardiac enzymes and ongoing management of his coronary artery disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement who presented to the ICU with acute onset shortness of breath. He has a history of hypertension, chronic renal failure, and mild CAD. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but he continues to require oxygen. His blood pressure is now under control with the use of nitroglycerin and other medications. The patient's renal function is improving with diuretic therapy. There are concerns about possible infection, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient's anemia may be due to chronic renal disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's diabetes, depression/anxiety, and gout are stable. The patient is on strict isolation precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles in the bibasilar lung fields suggest possible pulmonary edema. Continued diuretic therapy and close monitoring of respiratory status are necessary to manage this condition.

2. Infection: There is a concern for possible infection, as evidenced by the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy as needed are important.

3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's history of chronic renal failure and improving renal function indicate ongoing monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance. Strict"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement now decreasing in setting of possible infection versus pulm
   edema versus pulm hemorrhage.
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  Chest imaging concerning for edema vs infection vs
   hemorrhage.  Respiratory status now improving, stable on room air.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro has been weaned off.
   - goal SBP 110s
 130s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response
   - bumex and diuril -> better response
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> increased hydral and
   nifedipine.
   -  ID following, recs appreciated.  Will continue levo and ceftriaxone
   for now ([**9-22**]-present) -> ceftriaxone d/c
d, levoflox for 10d
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely [**2-8**] CHF with venous
   congestion (bland sediment), although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and
   pt has preserved systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic
   hypertensive glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr improving today, will cont with diuresis as above, repeat
   sediment bland
   .
   # HTN : will continue regimen as above. Currently good BP control.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**], no evidence of MI
   currently.  CE neg.
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade as above, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs total with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, Fe
   supplementation started
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable
   -  pt will need colonoscopy following discharge
   .
   # Type II DM - lantus and SS [**Last Name (LF) 10263**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt's home sliding scale
   -  increased basal insulin for better control

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and previous aortic valve replacement (AVR) complicated by prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR. He presented to the floor with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and was transferred to the cardiovascular care unit (CCU) due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with possible infection versus pulmonary edema versus pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's initial blood pressure was very high, and he was started on nitroglycerin (NTG) immediately, which resulted in a good response. The goal blood pressure is to be maintained at 110-130 systolic. Diuretics have been adjusted to improve fluid removal, including lasix, metolazone, diuril, and bumex. The patient's current medications include Coreg, amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur, and nifedipine.

The patient's renal function is noted as acute on chronic renal failure, likely congestive heart failure (CHF) with venous congestion. The patient appears euvolemic, with preserved systolic function. There is mention of significant chronic hypertensive glomerulosclerosis. Renal recommendations are appreciated, and strict intake/output (Is/Os) will be maintained. The patient's urine sodium levels will be checked, and a follow-up renal ultrasound"

His current assessment and plan include:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The initial cause was suspected to be diastolic dysfunction due to known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection. The patient responded well to nitroglycerin, and his blood pressure has been controlled.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient likely has CHF with venous congestion. He is being managed with diuretics and will continue to have strict intake/output measurements.
3. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with his current medication regimen.
4. Coronaries: The patient has mild CAD and is on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is dyspnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and various events have occurred since admission. The patient has been receiving diuretics (Diuril + Bumex) and antibiotics (levofloxacin and ceftriaxone), which have been discontinued. The patient's creatinine levels are improving, indicating some progress in renal function. However, the patient is still experiencing mild hypokalemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/48 mmHg to 123/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and they have a first-degree AV block.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance without acute distress. There are no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. However, the patient does have bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. Blood glucose levels are high, indicating hyperglycemia. Renal function tests show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, suggesting renal impairment. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include hyperglycemia, anxiety, hypertension, dyspnea, acute renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve and subsequent aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2187**]. He presented to the floor with acute onset shortness of breath and was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement have decreased since then. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 152/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension (HTN), chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), depression/anxiety, gout, and a previous coronary angiography showing mild coronary artery disease (CAD). He underwent a redo AVR due to prosthetic valve endocarditis.

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles bibasilar and right lower extremity edema grade 1+. His laboratory results showed an elevated serum creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL and blood glucose levels ranging from 121 to 172 mg/dL. Other notable lab values include a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 419 K/uL, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia"

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Date of service was 9/23/9 at 10am. Critically ill due to acute
   diastolic CHF, acute renal failure, hypoxia, pneumonia, aortic
   stenosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of biscupid aortic valve who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2187**]. The patient presented from the floor with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB), which was initially thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement are decreasing, but there is still concern for possible infection, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, and the goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 110-130 mmHg. The patient has been on various diuretics including Lasix, Metolazone, Diuril, and Bumex to manage volume overload and hypertension. Nitroprusside was used initially but has been weaned off. The patient is currently on Coreg, Amlodipine, and Hydralazine, and will continue with an adjusted regimen upon discharge.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure and is being managed with diuretics, strict intake/output monitoring, and a renal ultrasound that showed no evidence of hydronephrosis or renal artery stenosis. The patient's creatinine levels have been improving.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with mild CAD from a catheterization in [**2190**], but no evidence of"

   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement now decreasing in setting of possible infection versus pulm
   edema versus pulm hemorrhage.
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  Chest imaging concerning for edema vs infection vs
   hemorrhage.  Respiratory status now improving, stable on room air.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro has been weaned off.
   - goal SBP 110s
 130s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response
   - bumex and diuril -> better response
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> increased hydral and
   nifedipine.
   -  ID following, recs appreciated.  Will continue levo and ceftriaxone
   for now ([**9-22**]-present) -> ceftriaxone d/c
d, levoflox for 10d
   - f/u cultures
   - will transition to po lasix and metolazone for diuresis.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely [**2-8**] CHF with venous
   congestion (bland sediment), although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and
   pt has preserved systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic
   hypertensive glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr improving today, will cont with diuresis as above, repeat
   sediment bland
   .
   # HTN : will continue regimen as above. Currently good BP control.
   - change imdur to night dosing given morning BP slightly increased
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**], no evidence of MI
   currently.  CE neg.
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade as above, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs total with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, Fe
   supplementation started
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable
   -  pt will need colonoscopy following discharge
   .
   # Type II DM - lantus and SS [**Last Name (LF) 10263**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt's home sliding scale
   -  increased basal insulin for better control

The patient presented to the hospital with acute onset shortness of breath and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's dyspnea and oxygen requirement have been decreasing, indicating improvement in respiratory status.

The patient's initial assessment suggests that the dyspnea/hypoxia may be due to diastolic dysfunction, possibly related to hypertension, with the possibility of an underlying pulmonary infection or pulmonary hemorrhage. Chest imaging is concerning for edema versus infection versus hemorrhage. Nitroglycerin was started immediately upon arrival, resulting in a good response with a decrease in blood pressure from 220s to 170s-180s, along with less dyspnea. The nitroglycerin was weaned off overnight, and the goal blood pressure is set at 110s-130s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with dyspnea and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to Ativan (Lorazepam) and morphine, both causing delirium. The patient received antibiotics, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, but no further information on the reason for their administration is provided. Heparin sodium was given as prophylaxis, and other ICU medications were also administered. The patient reported improvement in frequency of bowel movements and no longer experiences dyspnea. Review of systems showed no abnormalities except for the initial presentation of dyspnea. Flowsheet data indicated stable vital signs, with a slight decrease in blood pressure. The patient's weight remained unchanged. Fluid balance showed a net loss of 1010 mL. Respiratory support was not required, and the patient's ABG results were within normal range. Physical examination revealed a well-nourished patient without acute distress. Cardiovascular examination showed a normal pulse and heart sounds, with no murmurs or edema. Respiratory examination noted crackles at the right base. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, but lower extremity edema was present bilaterally. Neurologic examination was not assessed. Lab results showed elevated potassium levels and slightly abnormal liver function tests. Radiology images were not provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest possible acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male h/o biscupid aortic valve s/p AVR in [**2187**], complicated by
   prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring redo AVR, presented from floor
   with acute onset SOB, c/w flash pulm edema.  Dyspnea and oxygen
   requirement now decreasing in setting of possible infection versus pulm
   edema versus pulm hemorrhage.
   .
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  initially most likely [**2-8**] diastolic dysfunction in
   setting of known HTN, with possible overlying pulmonary infection.  Pt
   quite hypertensive upon arrival to CCU, very anxious, with labored
   breathing.  Chest imaging concerning for edema vs infection vs
   hemorrhage.  Respiratory status now improving, stable on room air.
   -  pt started on nitro gtt immediately upon arrival with good result,
   SBP now 170s-180s, down from 220s, with less dyspnea.  will attempt to
   wean overnight -> nitro has been weaned off.
   - goal SBP 110s
 130s
   -  lasix and metolazone -> little response
   -  lasix and diuril -> improved response
   - bumex and diuril -> better response
   -  will give coreg, amlodipine, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**] in setting of aggressive
   diuresis -> pt now on home anti-hypertensive regimen except for ACEi,
   [**Last Name (un) 239**]; replaced with imdur and Hydralazine -> increased hydral and
   nifedipine.
   -  ID following, recs appreciated.  Will continue levo and ceftriaxone
   for now ([**9-22**]-present) -> ceftriaxone d/c
d, levoflox for 10d
   - f/u cultures
   - will transition to po lasix and metolazone for diuresis.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 likely [**2-8**] CHF with venous
   congestion (bland sediment), although pt appears eu-hypervolemic, and
   pt has preserved systolic function.  Pt may have significant chronic
   hypertensive glomerulosclerosis
   - appreciate renal recs
   - will check urine lytes, f/u renal ultrasound -> no evidence of
   hydronephrosis or RAS
   - strict Is/Os
   - SCr improving today, will cont with diuresis as above, repeat
   sediment bland
   .
   # HTN : will continue regimen as above. Currently good BP control.
   - change imdur to night dosing given morning BP slightly increased
   .
   # CORONARIES:  mild CAD from cath in [**2190**], no evidence of MI
   currently.  CE neg.
   -  will cont ASA, statin, B blockade as above, hold ACEi, [**Last Name (un) 239**]
   .
   # PUMP:  TTE in [**2192**] suggests mild diasolic dysfunction with preserved
   LVEF and stable bioprosthetic aortic valve
   -  pt likely has progressive LVH since [**2190**], will treat acute diastolic
   dysfunction
   -  TTE yesterday, see above -> little change from
03, preserved LVEF >
   55%, mild diastolic dysfunction
   -  will obtain full results of RHC -> elevated left and right sided
   filling pressures, PA HTN
   .
   # RHYTHM:  in sinus rhythm with evidence of IVCD
   -  cont on telemetry, remains in NSR
   .
   # anemia- suspect anemia of chronic renal disease vs. gastritis vs.
   chronic LGIB; low suspicion for active bleeding
   -  received 2 units PRBCs total with good response
   -  iron studies suggest possible iron-deficiency anemia, Fe
   supplementation started
   -  cont to monitor Hct, stable
   -  pt will need colonoscopy following discharge
   .
   # Type II DM - lantus and SS [**Last Name (LF) 10263**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt's home sliding scale
   -  increased basal insulin for better control
   .
   # h/o depression/anxiety - stable, cont fluoxetine
