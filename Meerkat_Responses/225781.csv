She underwent coiling and was transferred to the MICU service for further management.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Left PICA aneurysm s/p coiling: The patient has expected left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness. Her head CT is stable, and she does not need to limit blood pressure control currently. Neurological exam should be monitored every 2 hours, and a head CT should be done if there are acute changes in the neuro exam.

2. Right femoral hematoma: An ultrasound was performed today without evidence of aneurysm or fistula, and the hematoma is stable. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) should be continuously monitored.

3. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, along with sputum production with a positive culture and previous infiltrate concerning for pneumonia (PNA). She is currently on ceftriaxone and should be encouraged to use incentive spirometry. Oxygen saturation should be maintained between 92-94%, and oxygen should be weaned as tolerated.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, along with sputum production that is positive for culture. This suggests a possible pneumonia (PNA). Although the chest X-ray appears improved, the patient appears acutely worse now. The patient has been in the hospital for over a week, and previous infiltrates are concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is already receiving ceftriaxone for Moraxella and now D3, but due to worsening respiratory status, it is recommended to start vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible HAP. Rechecking sputum samples and performing a computed tomography (CT) chest for pulmonary embolism (PE) with D5W NaHCO3 for prehydration is advised.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm and underwent coiling. The patient is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Neurological complications: The patient has an expected left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness due to the PICA aneurysm coiling. Monitoring the neuro exam every 2 hours and performing head CT if there are any acute changes is recommended.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, along with sputum production. This may be concerning for pneumonia. The patient is on ceftriaxone for Moraxella pneumonia. Encouraging incentive spirometry, maintaining SpO2 levels between 92-94%, and weaning O2 as tolerated are advised. Baseline COPD requires inhalers as needed.

3. Right femoral hematoma: Although the ultrasound did not show evidence of aneurysm or fistula, the patient has a stable R femoral hematoma. It is important to continue monitoring hematocrit (HCT) levels.

4. Severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, which has since been coiled. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, along with sputum production that is positive for culture. This suggests possible pneumonia (PNA). The chest X-ray appears improved but the patient is acutely worse. Sputum is growing Moraxella and now D3 ceftriaxone, although the patient has been in the hospital for over a week. A CT chest was done on 03/17, but the respiratory status is now worse. The CTA chest shows no pulmonary embolism (PE), new pulmonary edema, and new right greater than left pleural effusion.
- Diuresis: The patient diuresed well to Lasix, with the goal of achieving a net 1 L negative fluid balance today.
- Infection: The patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) yesterday. A repeat sputum"

   1. No pulmonary embolism is detected.
   2. New pulmonary edema and new moderate-to-severe bilateral pleural
   effusions
   and bibasilar atelectasis.
   3. New moderate atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
   4. Multiple exophytic cystic structures arising from the upper pole of
   the
   left kidney do not have appearance of a simple cyst. Further
   characterization
   of these cysts with MRI is recommended as described in detail in the CT
   of the
   torso of [**2189-3-17**].
   5. Indeterminate left adrenal lesion likely represents adenoma. This
   can
   also be confirmed at the time of MRI examination.
   6. Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now
   s/p coiling transferred to MICU service for further management
   .
   #. Hypoxia - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received 3 days of
   Ceftriaxone until yesterday ([**2189-3-24**]). It was switched to Vanc and
   zosyn given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA
   done yesterday showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and
   new R>L moderate pleural effusion. Pt was doing better early this
   morning, satting 90-91% on 2.5L O2 NC, then desatted to 80s and had to
   be transitioned to 50% face mask.
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Pt is net 2L neg in last 30 hours, with rise in bicarb, indicating
   likely contraction alkalosis. Will not diurese further.
   - Follow CXR
   - Recheck ABG
   - Mobilize pt (not moving much right now due to fatigue), chest PT,
   aggressive incentive spirometry.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - baseline COPD - inhalers prn
   - Goal O2 sat 90-92%, wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Neuro exam stable this morning.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. COPD - continue atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that has been coiled. She was admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm and is now in the MICU service for further management. The patient initially presented with hypoxia and sputum culture grew Moraxella. She received 3 days of ceftriaxone but continued to experience respiratory distress, so the antibiotics were switched to vancomycin and Zosyn due to concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed new pulmonary edema and moderate-to-severe bilateral pleural effusions, along with bibasilar atelectasis and moderate atelectasis of the right middle lobe. There are also multiple exophytic cystic structures arising from the upper pole of the left kidney, which do not appear to be simple cysts and require further characterization with an MRI. An indeterminate left adrenal lesion likely represents an adenoma and can be confirmed during the MRI examination. Moderate centrilobular emphysema is also present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been started on vancomycin, zosyn, ASA, and Plavix as per neurosurgical recommendations. A CT angiogram was performed, showing no pulmonary embolism but revealing moderate-severe bilateral pleural effusions with right greater than left atelectasis, right middle lobe collapse, and diffuse centrilobular emphysematous changes. Lasix 20 mg IV was given, resulting in brisk diuresis. Diltiazem 30 mg QID PO was initiated for tachycardia and hypertension.

24-hour events include restarting ASA and Plavix, starting vancomycin and zosyn, and discontinuing ceftriaxone. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Infusions include furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and morphine sulfate.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 84 bpm with a range of 84-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 166/50 mmHg to 186/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 11-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that was treated with coiling. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypoxia, possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), COPD flare, left-sided weakness due to a medullary infarct, right femoral hematoma, severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia, PVD status post superficial mesenteric artery (SMA) stenting, and feeding difficulties. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, along with sputum production with positive culture and previous infiltrate concerning for PNA. Despite the improvement in chest X-ray, the patient's respiratory status has worsened. She is growing Moraxella and now D3 ceftriaxone. However, the patient has been in the hospital for over a week, and her respiratory status is now worse. 
   - Start vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible HAP; recheck sputum sample.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to the MICU service for further management.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. Firstly, she has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, along with sputum production with positive culture and previous infiltrate concerning for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics but may require a change in antibiotic regimen based on the culture results. Secondly, there is concern for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) given her acute worsening respiratory status. A CT angiography (CTA) has been ordered to rule out PE. Thirdly, the patient has a history of COPD and is experiencing a flare-up. Steroids may be considered if she fails to improve with antibiotics. Additionally, she has a left medullary infarct resulting from a coiling procedure for a left proximal PICA aneurysm, which has caused left-sided weakness. Neurosurgical recommendations should be followed closely, including monitoring her neurologic exam every 2 hours and obtaining a head CT if there are any acute changes. Lastly, she has severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia and will require ongoing monitoring of her hematocrit (HCT) levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted due to a large left proximal pulmonary artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. She was transferred to the MICU service for further management. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypoxia, possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness, a right femoral hematoma, severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with previous SMA stenting, and feeding difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, sputum production with positive culture, and previous infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Despite improvement in the chest X-ray, the patient appears acutely worse, and her respiratory status has worsened. She has been growing Moraxella and now D3 ceftriaxone, but she has been in the hospital for over a week. A CT chest has been ordered to rule out a pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's worsening respiratory status and positive cultures suggest the possibility of HAP. She has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazob"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with persistent post operative hypoxemia--this appears to
   be largely related to multiple challenges to effective gas
   exchange--this is attributable to unerlying COPD in addition to post
   operative atelectasis, bilteral pleural effusions and strong suggestion
   of pulmonary edema in this setting all have combined to create
   intermittent and significant hypoxemia
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   1)S/P cerebral artery embolization-
   -ASA/Plavix
   2)Hypoxemia
Multifactorial and dominant feature is the basilar
   atelectasis in the setting of apical lung tissue destruction from COPD
   driving hypoxemia.  On exam
bronchospasm does appear to be less likely.
   -Broad ABX
Vanco/Zosyn
   -No PE seen
   -Maintain even fluid balance in the setting of bilateral pleural

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with persistent post-operative hypoxemia. The hypoxemia is largely related to multiple challenges to effective gas exchange, including underlying COPD, post-operative atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure and has undergone cerebral artery embolization.

The patient is currently on broad antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin/Zosyn, and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The plan is to maintain even fluid balance, considering the bilateral pleural effusions. The patient is not volume overloaded and is overall negative throughout the hospital stay.

The patient needs increased ambulation and movement, pain control, and incentive spirometry. There are no wheezes, and there is no role for systemic steroid therapy. The patient's motor function, posture, knowledge, pain control (acute pain and chronic pain), and aneurysm are also mentioned as areas of concern.

The patient's history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is noted, and the patient is receiving ICU care, including a PO diet, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR. Had severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which
   responded to acetazolamide x1 and decrease in tidal volume. Alkalosis
   likely due, at least in part, to contraction, though only received
   lasix x1 on [**3-24**]. Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Consider bronch today for BAL +/- biopsy of RML node.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Neuro exam stable this morning. Unable to read yesterday,
   which per patient is new. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate
   when patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT

   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy

   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxia and respiratory distress. She has been experiencing episodes of silent aspiration, severe metabolic alkalosis, and requires mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to a combination of factors such as atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, increased dead space ventilation, and pneumonitis caused by barium aspiration. Further evaluation with a bronchoscopy for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) +/- biopsy of the right middle lobe (RML) node is recommended. Serial arterial blood gases (ABG) should be monitored, and thoracentesis may be considered if there is no improvement in symptoms.
2. Left Medullary Infarct: The patient is expected to have a left-sided weakness due to a left medullary infarct. Neurological examination should be performed every 4 hours, and a head CT scan should be done if there are any acute changes.
3. Right Femoral Hematoma: Although initially unstable, the right femoral hematoma is now stable. Monitoring of hematocrit (H"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypoxemia and was found to have chronic respiratory failure. The patient's condition worsened during a barium swallow study, leading to an episode of silent aspiration and subsequent intubation. The patient's arterial blood gases showed respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia. They were given nebulized bronchodilator treatment, which temporarily improved oxygen saturation levels. The patient also had an episode of desaturation while shifting positions and experienced fatigue and a junky cough. Thick white fluid was suctioned from their airway, and a sputum culture was sent for gram stain and culture.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is a significant concern. The hypoxemia and subsequent intubation indicate severe respiratory distress.
2. Aspiration: The episode of silent aspiration during the barium swallow study highlights the risk of aspiration in this patient. This can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Acid-Base Imbalance: The arterial blood gases show respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia, indicating an imbalance in the patient's acid-base levels. This can have various systemic effects and may require correction through interventions such as mechanical ventilation or medication.
4. Positional Desaturation: The patient's desaturation while shifting positions suggests potential issues with oxygenation during changes in body position. This could be due to compromised lung function or airway management.
5. Fatigue and Cough: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume. Alkalosis likely due, at least in
   part, to contraction, though only received lasix x1 on [**3-24**].
   - Consider bronch today for BAL +/- biopsy of RML node.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Obtain Dead Space Calculation
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/Sw eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm, which was subsequently coiled. She was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. She required intubation for persistent hypoxia on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NRBR).

The patient's sputum culture grew Moraxella, and she received three days of ceftriaxone until March 24th. It was then switched to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) given her continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) done on March 25th showed new pulmonary edema, and a moderate right-to-left pleural effusion. The CT also mentioned an 8 mm node causing right middle lobe collapse.

The patient has severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia, for which she received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on March 17th. Her hematocrit (HCT"

   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg

   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. The patient developed hypoxemia and respiratory distress, which led to intubation.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis caused by barium aspiration. A bronchoscopy was performed for BAL to obtain gram stain/culture. The PEEP was increased to recruit atelectatic airways and maintain oxygen saturation levels. The goal is to extubate the patient tomorrow, and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) will be initiated after the bronchoscopy. Serial ABG analysis and follow-up chest X-ray will also be done.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely multifactorial in nature. This includes contraction alkalosis due to diuresis and poor oral intake, elevated pCO2 from COPD/PNA, and compensatory HCO3 over the past week. Hyperaldosteronism is also a consideration. While intubated, the goal pCO2 is 50-55, and HCO3 is 30. The patient's urine chloride will be monitored, and ABGs will be followed.

   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. The patient is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress. She has a sputum culture that grew Moraxella and has received three days of ceftriaxone, switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed new pulmonary edema, a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, and an 8 mm lymph node causing right middle lobe collapse. The patient required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and eventually intubation for persistent hypoxia on the NIPPV. She had evidence of silent aspiration during a barium swallow study. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. The patient also has severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia, received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and is being transfused for a hematocrit (HCT) < 21. She has left kidney cysts and a left adrenal incidentaloma found on CT. She also has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting. The patient is on xanex 0.5 mg for anxiety and depression. She is currently receiving tube feeds and will need a nutrition consult. She is also on prophylactic heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and has an arterial line and peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU until her respiratory status improves."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. The patient underwent a barium swallow study, which revealed no evidence of areas of narrowing or stricture. However, there was an episode of silent aspiration while drinking barium. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to the 70s while shifting position and was given nebulized treatments. Due to the patient's fatigue and ineffective cough, they were intubated at 7:30 pm. Thick white fluid was suctioned from their airway.

The patient's blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 50, PaO2 of 113, HCO3- of 35, and BE of -8. They have been receiving various medications including antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam), heparin sodium, and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 160/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,568 mL, output of 2,390 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 822 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with history of COPD and now post procedure from coiling
   of CNS aneurysm and now with persistent and recurrent hypoxemia
   resulting in respiratory failure. She has a contribution from her
   underlying COPD and destructive lung disease dominant at apex
which is
   clearly seen on CT.  Following barium swallow
patient had likely
   aspiration (supported by CXR findings and clinical scenario) and with
   inability to clear secretions she has had further obstruction and loss
   of capacity to ventilate lower lobe areas contributing to further
   hypoxemia and ineffective ventilation.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Source as above
   -Will pursue bronchoscopy today for clearance of airway secretions
   -Increase PEEP to 10 and will look to recruit basilar lung units
   -Thoracentesis has been considered but with relatively small effusions
   and in the setting of positive airway pressure there is some risk for
   thoracentesis and pneumothorax but if re-expansion incomplete following
   bronch will have to consider thoracentesis
   2)S/P Embolization-
   -Follow exam
   -Some stable changes with unilateral weakness noted as persistent
   3)Metabolic Alkalosis-
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be manifestation of increased effective ventilation in the setting
   of previous chronic resp failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of COPD and recent coiling of a CNS aneurysm.
- She presented with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration after a barium swallow procedure.
- The patient has persistent and recurrent hypoxemia, contributing to ineffective ventilation.
- Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusions and collapse of the lung, along with barium seen in the left lower lobe airways.
- The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
- Labs indicate an elevated WBC count and decreased Hct, with other values within normal ranges.
- The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but decreased respiratory rate.
- The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and dullness on percussion.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and intervention to address respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and destructive lung disease contribute to ineffective ventilation and hypoxemia. Immediate interventions such as bronchoscopy for airway clearance and increasing PEEP to recruit basilar lung units are necessary. If re-expansion is incomplete, thoracentesis may be considered.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's elevated TCO2 and decreased Hct could indicate metabolic alkalosis, potentially due to increased effective ventilation in the setting of previous chronic respiratory failure.
3. Motor Function Impairment: The patient has stable changes with unilateral weakness"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   .

   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that underwent coiling. She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD with increased dead space ventilation, and pneumonitis caused by barium aspiration. She required intubation for persistent hypoxia on the NRB (negative predictive value) scale.

She had severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide and a decrease in tidal volume. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/48 to 152/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.4-13.1 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 24.1-25.5%, platelet count of 333-373 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.5-0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy at 02:26 PM on [**2189-3-26**]. Urine chloride was found to be low, indicating likely volume depletion, and the patient was bolused with 500 cc Normal Saline (NS). The patient's nutrition recommendations include receiving Nutren Pulmonary at a rate of 35cc/hr while on propofol drip and increasing the rate to 40cc/hr when the propofol drip is off. A BAL was performed and barium was washed out, but no samples were sent for analysis. A head CT was also performed per neurosurgical recommendations, showing no interval change, and the neurosurgeon is to sign off. Vent settings were adjusted to CPAP [**10-17**] to recruit more airspaces, which the patient tolerated well. Allergies are noted as no known drug allergies.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2189-3-26**] at 02:26 PM and received a bolus of normal saline (NS) due to low urine chloride levels, suggesting volume depletion. The patient's nutrition is being provided through Nutren Pulmonary at a rate of 35 mL/hr while on propofol drip and increasing to 40 mL/hr when the propofol drip is off. A head CT was performed per neurosurgical recommendations, showing no interval change, and the neurosurgeon is planning to sign off. Ventilator settings were adjusted to recruit more airspaces, with CPAP pressures ranging from 10-17 cmH2O. The patient is on multiple medications, including propofol, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and famotidine (Pepcid). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/48-152/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, which has since been coiled. The patient developed hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to intubation.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis from barium aspiration. She has received various treatments including bronchoscopy, increased PEEP, trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV), and continued vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). If the current interventions fail to improve respiratory function, a bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis may be considered.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, likely multifactorial in origin. This includes contraction alkalosis due to diuresis and poor oral intake, elevated pCO2 from COPD/PNA, and compensatory HCO3 over the past week. Additionally, hyperaldosteronism is a possible differential. The goal for pCO2 is 50-55, and HCO3 is 30.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Decrease PS/PEEP to attempt to extubate
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated soon
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP day 4 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - NS signed off, no new changes
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that underwent coiling. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient had sputum culture results indicating growth of Moraxella, and she received three days of ceftriaxone until March 24th. It was then switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) on March 25th showed new pulmonary edema, a moderate right-to-left pleural effusion, and an 8 mm lymph node causing right middle lobe collapse. The patient required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and was eventually intubated for persistent hypoxia on nasal cannula with respiratory bronchodilator response (NRBR).

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD with possible increased dead space ventilation, and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. The goal is to decrease pressure support/positive end-expiratory pressure (PS/PEEP)"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with initial admission for coiling of cerebral aneurysm
   and now post procedure course compliacted by recurrent respiratory
   failure with atelectasis and aspiration driving acute need for
   re-intubation.  She has been supported with PSV with good tolerance of
   minimal support settings.  The concern at this point is that patient
   has some low grade fever noted and mild increase in WBC count.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue Atrovent
   -Continue Vanco and will re-dose by trough/Zosyn
   -Will need to move to PSV 5/5 this morning and if favorable would move
   to SBT x 30 minutes and extubation.
   -Will continue with ABX
   -Repeat CXR to be completed with trial on [**5-12**]
   -Hope to move to extubation today.
   -With continued decreased motivation and suggestion of depressed mood
   will have to consider Ritalin or other simulants to aid in stimulation
   of patient participation in care.
   2)CNS Aneurysm/S/P coiling-
   -Plavix
   -ASA to continue

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female who was initially admitted for the coiling of a cerebral aneurysm and is now experiencing recurrent respiratory failure due to atelectasis and aspiration. She has been re-intubated and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with good tolerance of minimal support settings.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 94/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent respiratory issues.

The patient's physical examination shows symmetric chest expansion, dullness on percussion, and diminished breath sounds. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Other physical examinations remain unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, blood glucose of 114 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. Imaging shows a chest X-ray taken on 03/24/2189 at 01:00 AM.

The assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure with atelectasis and aspiration, for which the"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN

   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. She was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient had respiratory failure and sputum culture grew Moraxella, for which she received three days of ceftriaxone until March 24th. It was then switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed new pulmonary edema, a moderate right-to-left pleural effusion, and an 8 mm lymph node causing right middle lobe collapse. She required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and ultimately intubation for persistent hypoxia on nasal cannula with a respiratory bronchodilator.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. She also had severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide and a decrease in tidal volume.

   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30

   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling.
- The patient developed hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to intubation for persistent hypoxia on the NRB (negative pressure breathing) respirator.
- A CT angiogram showed new pulmonary edema, a moderate right-to-left pleural effusion, and an 8 mm node causing right middle lobe collapse.
- She required increased oxygen support and had evidence of silent aspiration on a barium swallow.
- The respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
- The patient also had severe metabolic alkalosis, which responded to acetazolamide and a decrease in tidal volume.
- An attempt was made to extubate the patient today, but steroids were started due to no cuff leak.
- The plan is to follow the chest X-ray, continue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and perform serial arterial blood gases (ABGs).
- Other ongoing concerns include a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness, a right fem"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to chronic aneurysm. They have been receiving various medications including propofol, famotidine, and steroids. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate between 73-91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/43 mmHg to 150/105 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL. They have decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases, more pronounced on the right side. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 114-130 mg/dL, while other lab results show normal ranges for white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory symptoms, is crucial.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with persistent respiratory compromise. The main concern is the absence of cuff leak and potential upper airway edema, which has now resolved with the administration of Decadron. The patient has shown minimal change in infiltrates and effusions. She tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) well, with a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The plan is to extubate the patient today, discontinue Propofol, and closely monitor her with physical therapy to aid in clearance of secretions. She will continue with antibiotic therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which could potentially lead to further complications such as hypoxemia (low oxygen levels) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels) if not properly managed after extubation.
2. Upper Airway Edema: Although the patient's upper airway edema has resolved with the use of Decadron, there is still a risk of its recurrence, which can cause airway obstruction.
3. Secretion Clearance: Since the patient will be extubated, there is a possibility of difficulty in clearing secretions, which can lead to pneumonia or further respiratory complications.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing DVTs, especially with the use of a PICC line.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. The patient was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient had a sputum culture that grew Moraxella and received three days of ceftriaxone until March 24th. The antibiotic was switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed new pulmonary edema, a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, and an 8 mm lymph node causing right middle lobe collapse. The patient required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and eventually intubation for persistent hypoxia on nasal cannula with respiratory bronchospasm (NRBR). The respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. She had severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide and a decrease in tidal volume.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis, which responded to acetazolamide x1 and
   decrease in tidal volume.  Now successfully extubated with a cuff
   leak.  Steroids for airway edema stopped.   Oxygen weaned down
   overnight.
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days

   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Urine
   lytes (Cl- specifically) consistent with dehydration.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed

   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. She developed hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to intubation. The sputum culture grew Moraxella, and she received three days of ceftriaxone before being switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A CT angiogram showed new pulmonary edema, a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, and an 8 mm lymph node causing right middle lobe collapse. She was on 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen most of yesterday and had evidence of silent aspiration on barium swallow. The respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD with possible increased dead space ventilation, and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. She had severe metabolic alkalosis, which responded to acetazolamide and a decrease in tidal volume. She was successfully extubated with a cuff leak, and steroids for airway edema were stopped. Oxygen was weaned down overnight.

   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future

   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling.
- The patient developed hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to intubation and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).
- She had sputum culture results positive for Moraxella, and received 3 days of ceftriaxone until March 24th. The antibiotic regimen was switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed new pulmonary edema, moderate right-to-left pleural effusion, and an 8 mm node causing right middle lobe collapse.
- The patient required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and had evidence of silent aspiration on barium swallow.
- She experienced severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide and decrease in tidal volume.
- The patient's tracheostomy tube size is 8.0, which is large for a small patient.
- Steroids were started, and the patient is expected to be extubated today.
- The plan is to follow chest X-ray,"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female admitted following PICA embolization and with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure with atelectasis, small effusions and
   aspiratoin of barium leading to acute need for intubation.  She now has
   tolerated extubation with improved lung volumes, improved oxygenation
   and improved atelectasis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair, ambulation today
   -Incentive spirometry
   -Excellent tolerance of wean of O2
   -Complete course of ABX
   -Really will be interventions to maintain airspace patency that will
   drive stability of oxygenation.
   2)S/P PICA Aneurysm-
   -Continue with ASA/Plavix
   3)Nutrition
Will continue to provide TF
s for now, encourage PO with
   swallowing verified as adequate.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure after a procedure called PICA embolization. She had progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure due to atelectasis, small effusions, and aspiration of barium. The patient tolerated extubation well, showing improved lung volumes, oxygenation, and reduced atelectasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still at risk for respiratory failure due to previous episodes and underlying conditions. Close monitoring and continued use of incentive spirometry are necessary to maintain lung function.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and in the ICU, there is an increased risk for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued.

3. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay. Proton pump inhibitors should be continued for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): VAP is a common complication in intubated patients. Measures should be taken to minimize the risk, such as proper hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic selection, and early weaning from mechanical ventilation.

5. Nutrition: The patient may require nutritional support, and tube feeding is currently being provided. However, encouraging oral intake once swallowing is verified as adequate is important for long-term nutrition and"
