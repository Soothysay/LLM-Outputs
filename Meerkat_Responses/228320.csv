   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old female with history of COPD on 2-4L home O2,
   Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder
   admitted [**2135-2-27**] for chest pain and dyspnea after 5 days of viral
   syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory Distress: Multifocal PNA of either viral, atypical or
   bacterial etiology on top of underlying COPD. Likely complicated by
   volume overload after receiving 2.5L NS on day of admission and
   psychiatric overlay.
   - continue with levofloxacin, vancomycin for possible health-care
   associated PNA
   - viral screen negative
   - standing xopenex/ipratropium nebs (pt refusing to use)
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, c. diff (pt not co-operating to give
   samples)
   - maintain patient slightly volume negative as HR and BP tolerate
   - hold standing tylenol, percocet to assess fever curve
   - trend WBC
   .
   # Tachycardia: Has been sinus since admission. Differential includes
   hypoxia, intravascular vol depletion, PE, anemia, hyperthyroidism,
   anxiety, pericardia effusion/tamponade. Anemia near baseline but in
   setting of significant pulmonary infiltrates, may explain current
   tachycardia. Patient appears total volume overloaded on exam. EKG
   without evidence of electrical alternans/low voltage. Can not exclude
   PE as a possibility.
   - received 1U PRBC, refused post tx HCT check
   - continue home psychiatric regimen, consider anxiolytic prn
   - TSH 3.8
   - consider CTA to rule out PE and further assess pulmonary parenchyma
   - continue on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: History of anemia of chronic inflammation with basline HCT of
   29-30. She reports both bright and dark blood in stool x5 days which
   patient attributes to internal and external hemmorhoids. Has history of
   severe gastritis on PPI and misoprostol as outpatient. Has had negative
   rectal guaiac since admission. High MCV, nl B12/folate, low Fe, low
   TIBC, low tranferrin and high ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs negative.
   - continue to guaiac all stools
   - continue to trend HCT Q8H (pt refusing lab draws since [**2-29**] PM)
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 2 large bore IVs for access
   - continue IV PPI and misoprostol
   .
   # Widened Mediastinum: Visualized on CXR. Differential includes
   reactive lymphadenopathy, aortic dissection, pulmonary vascular
   congestion. No pain, with equal pulses b/l making dissection less
   likely.
   - consider CT Chest to further evaluate
   # Chronic Diarrhea:Patient has chronic history of diarrhea; is
   currently afebrile and denies current diarrhea symptoms but continues
   to have loose stools. Possible viral in etiology given lack of sick
   contacts, recent travel, or introduction of new foods into diet vs. c.
   diff.
   - send stool for C.diff, hold standing bowel regimen, home laxatives
   were removed by primary floor team
   .
   # Chronic Pain: Etiology unclear
   - continue on home regimen for now, switch prn percocet to oxycodone to
   avoid antipyretic
   .
   # Psychiatric: H/o anorexia, poly-substance abuse, borderline
   personality disorder, bipolar
   - continue outpt meds for now
   - consider psych consult for managment of underlying agitation
   - confirm diagnosis/medications w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8022**]

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea after experiencing a viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by multifocal pneumonia, likely complicated by volume overload after receiving a large amount of normal saline on the day of admission. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which could be due to hypoxia, intravascular volume depletion, pulmonary embolism (PE), anemia, hyperthyroidism, anxiety, or pericardial effusion/tamponade. Anemia near baseline may explain the current tachycardia.

The patient's anemia is consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation, with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), normal B12/folate levels, low iron (Fe), low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), low transferrin, and high ferritin. Hemolysis labs are negative.

The patient has a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray, which could be due to reactive lymphadenopathy, aortic dissection, or pulmonary vascular congestion. A CT chest is recommended to further evaluate this finding.

The patient also has a history of chronic diarrhea, which may be viral in etiology or possibly due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Stool samples"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea after experiencing a viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress due to multifocal pneumonia, sinus tachycardia, anemia, and chronic diarrhea. She also has a history of chronic inflammation, severe gastritis, and internal and external hemorrhoids. The patient is currently alert but irritable, refusing a full exam. She is on mechanical ventilation support with a nasal cannula and face tent, and her blood oxygen saturation is at 94%. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 100/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 37.1°C. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells but refused a post-transfusion hematocrit check. Her lab results indicate low hemoglobin levels, low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), low iron levels, low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), low transferrin, and high ferritin consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs are negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has multifocal pneumonia on top of underlying COPD, which increases the risk of respiratory failure and the need for invasive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea after experiencing a viral syndrome with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory distress. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications.

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which is likely aspiration-related. She is being switched from vancomycin to Unasyn, as it is more appropriate for her condition. The patient is refusing to use the nebulizer treatments, and there is intermittent wheezing present.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing sinus tachycardia since admission. Possible causes include hypoxia due to multifocal pneumonia, intravascular volume depletion, pulmonary embolism, anemia, hyperthyroidism, or anxiety. Anemia near baseline may explain the current tachycardia, but the TSH level is normal. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and her hemoglobin level is stable at 34%.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic inflammation with baseline HCT of 29-30.

   admitted [**2135-2-27**] for chest pain and dyspnea after 5 days of viral
   syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory Distress: Multifocal PNA of either viral, atypical or
   bacterial etiology on top of underlying COPD. Pt with history of
   multifocal PNA most likely [**2-20**] aspiration (dysfunction confirmed with
   S&S).
   - continue vanc, switch levaquin to zosyn for likely aspiration PNA
   - viral screen negative

   patient attributes to internal and external hemmorhoids. Has history of
   severe gastritis on PPI and misoprostol as outpatient. Has had negative
   rectal guaiac since admission. High MCV, nl B12/folate, low Fe, low
   TIBC, low tranferrin and high ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea following a viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and recent investigations suggest worsening multifocal PNA. She also has anemia of chronic inflammation, chronic diarrhea, chronic pain, and psychiatric issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the progression of multifocal pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate treatment, such as antibiotics, bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy, are necessary.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to hypoxia, intravascular volume depletion, pulmonary embolism, anemia, hyperthyroidism, or anxiety. Further evaluation is required to determine the exact cause and provide appropriate management.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic inflammation, and her current hemoglobin level is low. Continued monitoring and treatment for anemia may be necessary.
4. Chronic Diarrhea: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, and recent investigations suggest a possible viral etiology. Stool analysis for C. diff and other pathogens should be conducted to guide management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea after experiencing a viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including multifocal pneumonia (PNA), tachycardia, anemia, and chronic diarrhea. The PNA is likely due to aspiration, as confirmed by symptoms and dysfunction. The patient's tachycardia is likely caused by worsening PNA and possible anemia. Her anemia is related to chronic inflammation and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The cause of her chronic diarrhea is unclear but may be viral or due to Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 83/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has been placed on full code status and is at high risk for aspiration due to her severe underlying lung disease. The medical team plans to discuss goals of care with the patient and her family, considering the possibility of placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube to prevent oral intake and the potential need for intubation. The patient is currently refusing recommended interventions such as fluid boluses, nebulizer treatments, and lab draws.

   This is a 58 year old female with history of COPD on 2-4L home O2,
   Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder
   admitted [**2135-2-27**] for chest pain and dyspnea after 5 days of viral
   syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory Distress: Multifocal PNA of either viral, atypical or
   bacterial etiology on top of underlying COPD. Pt with history of
   multifocal PNA most likely [**2-20**] aspiration (dysfunction confirmed with
   S&S).
   - unasyn for asp PNA
   - wean FiO2
   - failed speech and swallow exam, keep NPO
   - refusing NGT/PEG, will need to d/w Sister, PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**]
   - viral screen negative
   - standing ipratropium nebs, d/c xoponex
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
 NGTD
   .
   # Tachycardia: Has been sinus since admission. Differential includes
   hypoxia ([**2-20**] PNA), intravascular volume depletion, PE, anemia,
   hyperthyroidism, anxiety.  Most likely [**2-20**] worsening multifocal PNA as
   seen on CXR.  Anemia near baseline but in setting of significant
   pulmonary infiltrates, may explain current tachycardia. TSH normal.
   - holding beta agonists
   - received 1U PRBC [**2-29**]
   - monitor HCT
   - continue home psychiatric regimen, consider anxiolytic prn
   - cont to treat PNA

   29-30. She reports both bright and dark blood in stool x5 days which
   patient attributes to internal and external hemmorhoids. Has history of
   severe gastritis on PPI and misoprostol as outpatient. Has had negative
   rectal guaiac since admission. High MCV, nl B12/folate, low Fe, low
   TIBC, low tranferrin and high ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs negative.
   - continue to guaiac all stools
   - continue to trend HCT (pt intermittently refuses)
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 2 large bore IVs for access
   - continue IV PPI and misoprostol
   .
   # Chronic Diarrhea:Patient has chronic history of diarrhea; is
   currently afebrile and denies current diarrhea symptoms but continues
   to have loose stools. Possible viral in etiology given lack of sick
   contacts, recent travel, or introduction of new foods into diet vs. c.
   diff.
   - f/u C.diff, hold standing bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder.
- She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea after experiencing a viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
- The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
- She is tachycardic, with a possible cause being the worsening multifocal pneumonia seen on the chest X-ray.
- The patient has a history of anemia of chronic inflammation with a baseline HCT of 29-30. She reports bloody stools but has negative rectal guaiac since admission.
- She also has chronic diarrhea, which may be viral in etiology.
- The patient's psychiatric history includes anorexia, poly-substance abuse, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder.
- The patient is refusing to accept recommended interventions such as PEG tube placement and NGT due to failed speech and swallow exam.
- She has severe underlying lung disease and would not tolerate intubation and weaning.
- The patient's current code status is Full Code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's refusal of NGT/PEG and continued PO intake despite warnings increase the risk of further aspiration, leading to worsening respiratory distress and potential pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's underlying lung disease and the need for respiratory support"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been switched to a different antibiotic, Unasyn, for aspiration coverage.
- The patient failed a bedside speech and swallow exam.
- The patient continues to get out of bed and drink water despite warnings, showing awareness of the risks but not caring.
- Psychiatric consultation was discussed, but it is not believed that medication will change the patient's behavior.
- The patient's ventilator settings have been weaned down to 3 L NC with 35% facemask, but they still desaturate when moving around.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, as well as unknown allergies to meperidine, codeine, propoxyphene.

The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin at 06:00 AM, Vancomycin at 08:15 AM, and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) at 12:13 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 mmHg to 133/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,110 mL since 12 AM, with a total output of 1,450 mL. The patient's urine output is 1,450 mL, and their NG output is -400 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with a high flow nasal cannula, and their ABG results are not provided in the note.

The patient's physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not being performed, skin assessment not being performed, and neurologic assessment not being performed.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 25.2 g/dL, platelet count of 292 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose level of 57 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided but are not detailed here.

The patient has two listed medical problems: pneumonia due to aspiration and chronic anemia.

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status due to aspiration pneumonia, worsening of the patient's anemia, and the risk of developing other infections or complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of chronic anemia, who was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia caused by aspiration. She has been switched to unasyn for aspiration coverage, but continues to get out of bed and drink water despite warnings. The patient is aware of the risks but does not care. She is alert and oriented, but irritable and refusing a full examination. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 100/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has been weaned down to 3 L NC with 35% facemask, still experiencing desaturation when moving around. Her blood glucose level is low at 57 mg/dL. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Her kidney function is slightly impaired with an elevated creatinine level. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's current condition of pneumonia is due to aspiration. Continued aspiration can worsen the infection and lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation may drop significantly"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 58 year old female with history of COPD on 2-4L home O2,
   Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder
   admitted [**2135-2-27**] for chest pain and dyspnea after 5 days of viral
   syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory Distress: Multifocal PNA of either viral, atypical or
   bacterial etiology on top of underlying COPD. Pt with history of
   multifocal PNA most likely [**2-20**] aspiration (dysfunction confirmed with
   S&S).
   - unasyn for asp PNA
   - failed speech and swallow exam, NPO
   - refusing NGT/PEG
   - viral screen negative
   - standing xopenex/ipratropium nebs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx
 NGTD
   - hold standing tylenol, percocet to assess fever curve
   .
   # Tachycardia: Has been sinus since admission. Differential includes
   hypoxia ([**2-20**] PNA), intravascular volume depletion, PE, anemia,
   hyperthyroidism, anxiety.  Most likely [**2-20**] worsening multifocal PNA as
   seen on CXR.  Anemia near baseline but in setting of significant
   pulmonary infiltrates, may explain current tachycardia. TSH normal.
   - received 1U PRBC [**2-29**]
   - monitor HCT
   - continue home psychiatric regimen, consider anxiolytic prn
   - TSH 3.8
   - cont to treat PNA
   .
   # Anemia: History of anemia of chronic inflammation with basline HCT of
   29-30. She reports both bright and dark blood in stool x5 days which
   patient attributes to internal and external hemmorhoids. Has history of
   severe gastritis on PPI and misoprostol as outpatient. Has had negative
   rectal guaiac since admission. High MCV, nl B12/folate, low Fe, low
   TIBC, low tranferrin and high ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic inflammation. Hemolysis labs negative.
   - continue to guaiac all stools
   - continue to trend HCT (pt intermittently refuses)
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 2 large bore IVs for access
   - continue IV PPI and misoprostol
   .
   # Chronic Diarrhea:Patient has chronic history of diarrhea; is
   currently afebrile and denies current diarrhea symptoms but continues
   to have loose stools. Possible viral in etiology given lack of sick
   contacts, recent travel, or introduction of new foods into diet vs. c.
   diff.
   - f/u C.diff, hold standing bowel regimen
   .
   # Chronic Pain: Etiology unclear
   - continue on home regimen for now, switch prn percocet to oxycodone to
   avoid antipyretic
   .
   # Psychiatric: H/o anorexia, poly-substance abuse, borderline
   personality disorder, bipolar
   - continue outpt meds for now
   - psych consult for managment of underlying agitation -> has refused to
   talk with them
   - confirm diagnosis/medications w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8022**]

   # Communication: Patient and sister [**Name (NI) 2099**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8025**]
   .
   # Disposition: Will need to get in touch with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2045**], PCP and
   daughter to discuss goals of care.  Pt is serious aspiration risk and
   likely will need a PEG tube to avoid PO intake.  Pt with severe
   underlying lung disease and would likely not tolerate intubation and
   weaning.  Pt is currently Full Code.  Pt currently refusing to accept
   recommended interventions (PEG, NGT) even after completely failing S&S

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic CHF, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder.
- Admitted for chest pain and dyspnea after a viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress.
- Currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
- Refusing to accept recommended interventions such as PEG tube and NGT.
- Tachycardia likely due to worsening multifocal pneumonia and anemia.
- Chronic diarrhea, possibly viral in etiology.
- History of anemia of chronic inflammation.
- Chronic pain with unclear etiology.
- Psychiatric history includes anorexia, poly-substance abuse, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and failed speech and swallow exam indicate a high risk for aspiration pneumonia. If not properly managed, this can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's refusal to tolerate intubation and weaning, there is a risk of developing VAP if mechanical ventilation is required.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin are being taken, but close monitoring is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of COPD, systolic heart failure, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She was admitted for chest pain and dyspnea following a viral syndrome with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. She is also experiencing tachycardia, anemia, and chronic diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially require mechanical ventilation.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by hypoxia from the pneumonia, intravascular volume depletion, pulmonary embolism, anemia, hyperthyroidism, or anxiety. It is improving with treatment of the pneumonia.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia of chronic inflammation with a baseline hematocrit (HCT) of 29-30. She reports passing bright and dark blood in her stool, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia and address any potential bleeding.
4. Chronic Diarrhea: The patient has a chronic history of diarrhea, but currently denies symptoms. Possible causes include viral etiology, Clostridium difficile infection, or other gastrointestinal conditions. Monitoring and appropriate testing should be done to identify the cause and guide treatment.
5. Chronic Pain: The etiology of the patient's chronic pain is unclear, and further assessment is necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate management.
6. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has a history of anorexia, poly-substance abuse, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Ongoing psychiatric support and medication management are required.
7. Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO due to failed swallow evaluation, but long-term nutrition options such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may be necessary. Nutritional consultation is recommended.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are currently replete, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to prevent imbalances.
9. Infection Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, pneumoboots for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
10. Access: The patient has peripheral IV lines for medication administration and fluid management.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory distress, tachycardia, anemia, chronic diarrhea, chronic pain, psychiatric issues, nutrition, electrolyte balance, and infection prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, admitted to the ICU due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and requires oxygen support. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 102/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert but irritable, refusing a full examination. Physical examination reveals coarse rhonchi in the left mid-upper field and intermittent wheezing. The patient's abdomen is distended but soft, with present bowel sounds. There are no signs of rebound tenderness or guarding. Extremities are warm and well perfused with 2+ pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good airway hygiene and regular assessment of respiratory status.
2. Aspiration events: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia suggests a high risk for recurrent aspiration events. Continuous monitoring and appropriate positioning can help minimize this risk.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are crucial for prevention.
