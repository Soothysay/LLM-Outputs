   # MSSA Bacteremia/Vegetation on Pacer wire/Septic Arthritis: Cr
   elevated on admission to NEBH prompting treatment with high dose
   CTX/daptomycin.  Patient is persistently febrile, however, with
   persistent bacteremia through [**2-16**] and Cr has improved suggesting that
   it would now be reasonable to opt for more standard therapy with
   nafcillin/gent/rifampin.  At this point, will add nafcillin, but will
   hold on gent/rifampin and discuss with ID regarding timing of adding
   those therapies as well as duration of therapy.
   - NPO for lab Thursday
   - Nafcillin
   - hold rifampin and gent for now
   - daily cultures while febrile
   - ID consult appreciated
   - Ortho consult prn for knee
   - careful joint exam when off sedation for other possible sites of
   infection
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI with
   stent placement.  Anatomy as above.
   - Continue statin, aspirin, toprol XL
   .
   # PUMP:  EF 30-40%.  Mild decompensated CHF by exam/imaging.  No
   immediate plan to extubate as going to the lab tomorrow.
   - consider IV lasix tomorrow
   .
   # RHYTHM: History of A. Fib on coumadin and OSH ECG's suggest possible
   a. flutter.  Patient at high risk for systemic embolization given
   septic knee, high grade bacteremia, although most likely source for
   emboli is the lungs.  As such, would hold anticoagulation with heparin
   gtt for now and monitor on tele.
   - hold heparin gtt and consider head CT prior to initiating heparin
   - metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - check digoxin level and if not elevated restart home dose as Cr now
   baseline.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely needs mild volume optimization before can
   be safely extubated.
   - daily wean of sedation.
   - Consider Chest CT for e/o septic emboli to the lungs and staph
   pneumonia if respiratory status worsens, or have difficulty with
   extubation.
   .
   # OSA: Intubated, will need home CPAP s/p extubation.
   .
   # Depression: hold welbutrin and amitriptyline for now.
   - restart prn.
   .
   # Gout: on allopurinol.
   .
   # HTN: continue on metoprolol.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous cardiac bypass surgery (CABG) who presented with MSSA lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU and has been diagnosed with bacteremia, vegetation on the pacer wire, and septic arthritis. The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels were elevated upon admission, but have improved after receiving high-dose cefazolin and daptomycin. The patient remains febrile despite persistent bacteremia. The plan is to switch to standard therapy with nafcillin/gentamicin/rifampin, but will hold rifampin and gentamicin for now. The patient will continue to have daily cultures while febrile, and an Infectious Disease (ID) consult is appreciated. Orthopedic consultation is also requested for knee evaluation. The patient has a history of CAD with CABG and PCI with stent placement. The patient's ejection fraction is 30-40% and there is mild decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). There are no immediate plans to extubate the patient as they are going to the lab tomorrow. Consideration should be given to intravenous lasix tomorrow. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and there are suspicions of possible atrial flutter. High-risk systemic embolization is a concern"

   emboli is the lungs.  As such, would hold anticoagulation with heparin
   gtt for now and monitor on tele.
   - hold heparin gtt and consider head CT prior to initiating heparin
   - metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - check digoxin level and if not elevated restart home dose as Cr now
   baseline.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely needs mild volume optimization before can

   - daily wean of sedation.
   - Consider Chest CT for e/o septic emboli to the lungs and staph
   pneumonia if respiratory status worsens, or have difficulty with
   extubation.
   .
   # OSA: Intubated, will need home CPAP s/p extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. The patient also had previous knee replacement surgery and is now presenting with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for persistent fever and bacteremia despite receiving high-dose ceftriaxone and daptomycin. The creatinine level on admission was elevated, but it has improved, suggesting that it would now be reasonable to opt for standard therapy with nafcillin, gentamicin, and rifampin. Nafcillin has been added to the treatment regimen, while gentamicin and rifampin will be held for discussion with the infectious disease (ID) specialist regarding timing and duration of therapy.

The patient's medical history includes a history of CAD, which required CABG and PCI with stent placement. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 30-40%, and there is mild decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) present. There is no immediate plan to extubate the patient as they are going to the lab tomorrow. IV lasix may be considered tomorrow.

The patient also has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, s/p CABG w/ PPM/ICD prior knee replacement surgery
   now p/w MSSA lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee.
   # MSSA Bacteremia/Vegetation on Pacer wire/Septic Arthritis:
   Cr elevated on admission to NEBH prompting treatment with high dose
   CTX/daptomycin.  Patient is persistently febrile, however, with
   persistent bacteremia through [**2-16**] and Cr has improved suggesting that
   it would now be reasonable to opt for more standard therapy with
   nafcillin/gent/rifampin.  At this point, will add nafcillin, but will
   hold on gent/rifampin and discuss with ID regarding timing of adding
   those therapies as well as duration of therapy.  Ortho consulted
   yesterday.  Knees do not appear warm or swollen.
   - Continue Nafcillin, per ID recs
   - Wound Care, per Ortho Recs
   - hold rifampin and gent for now
   - daily cultures while febrile
   - ID consult appreciated
   # Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation:
   Day#5 of Intubation.  Barriers to extubation include mental status,
   extreme agitation, and high level of PEEP required.  Appears to be
   ventilating well.  Could use a little diuresis prior to extubation.
   - gentle diuresis
   - decreased sedation to evaluate mental status and attempt pressure
   support trial
   - slowly decrease PEEP so as not to derecruit alveoli
   - Consider Chest CT for e/o septic emboli to the lungs and staph
   pneumonia if respiratory status worsens, or have difficulty with
   extubation.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF:
   EF 30-40%. JVP difficult to assess, but CXR shows mild fluid overload.
   - gentle diuresis today
   .
   # Hx Atrial Fibrillation:  On coumadin at home and OSH ECG's suggest
   possible A. flutter.  Patient at high risk for systemic embolization
   given septic knee, high grade bacteremia, although most likely source
   for emboli is the lungs.  As such, would hold anticoagulation with
   heparin gtt for now and monitor on tele.  Has history of conversion
   pauses, and had low EF and risk of VT (though no VT hx), for which he
   received pacemaker/ICD, so should monitor for these arrhythmias.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold heparin gtt and consider head CT prior to initiating heparin
   - metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue home digoxin
   # Hypernatremia:
   Persists.  Has about 8L free water deficit.
   - replete IV and PO per OG tube if we can place OG tube again and
   confirm placement
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI with stent
   placement.  Anatomy as above.
   - Continue statin, aspirin, toprol XL
   # OSA: Intubated, will need home CPAP s/p extubation.
   # Depression: hold wellbutrin and amitriptyline for now.
   - restart prn, post extubation.
   # Gout: on allopurinol.
   # HTN: continue on metoprolol.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee. The patient has been persistently febrile with bacteremia through [**2-16**] and has an elevated creatinine (Cr) level on admission, which has improved. He is currently being treated with high-dose CTX/daptomycin but will now be started on nafcillin as per ID recommendations. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is still intubated due to mental status changes and agitation. There are concerns about chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30-40%), atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and several comorbidities such as CAD, OSA, depression, gout, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently on multiple medications and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent bacteremia and septic arthritis: Despite treatment with daptomycin and nafcillin, there is a risk of ongoing bacteremia and septic arthritis leading to worsening infection and potential complications like septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's agitation and altered mental status pose a challenge for extubation. There"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, s/p CABG w/ PPM/ICD prior knee replacement surgery
   now p/w MSSA lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee.
   # MSSA Bacteremia/Vegetation on Pacer wire/Septic Arthritis:
   Cr elevated on admission to NEBH prompting treatment with high dose
   CTX/daptomycin.  Patient is persistently febrile, however, with
   persistent bacteremia through [**2-16**] and Cr has improved suggesting that
   it would now be reasonable to opt for more standard therapy with
   nafcillin/gent/rifampin.  At this point, will add nafcillin, but will
   hold on gent/rifampin and discuss with ID regarding timing of adding
   those therapies as well as duration of therapy.  Ortho consulted
   yesterday.  Knees do not appear warm or swollen.  Coag Neg staph also
   grown in blood cultures at OSH.
   - Continue Nafcillin, per ID recs
   - start Vancomycin for Coag Neg staph ; ask ID whether should continue
   both Nafcillin and Vanc once Vanc trough appropriate
   - Wound Care for knee, per Ortho Recs
   - if knee worsens or looks infected in next 24-48 hours, call Ortho
   again b/c of possibility of another nidus of infection
   - TEE to look for valve vegetations as another nidus of infection
   - hold rifampin and gent for now
   - daily cultures while febrile
   - ID consult appreciated
   # Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation:
   Day#5 of Intubation.  Barriers to extubation include mental status,
   extreme agitation, and high level of PEEP required.  Appears to be
   ventilating well.  Diuresed yesterday to keep even
   - gentle diuresis as needed
   - decreased sedation to evaluate mental status and attempt pressure
   support trial
   - slowly decrease PEEP so as not to derecruit alveoli
   - Consider Chest CT for e/o septic emboli to the lungs and staph
   pneumonia if respiratory status worsens, or have difficulty with
   extubation.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF:
   EF 30-40%. JVP difficult to assess; CXR shows mild fluid overload prior
   to lasix dose last night
   - gentle diuresis today as needed
   .
   # Hx Atrial Fibrillation:  On coumadin at home and OSH ECG's suggest
   possible A. flutter.  Patient at high risk for systemic embolization
   given septic knee, high grade bacteremia, although most likely source
   for emboli is the lungs.  As such, would hold anticoagulation with
   heparin gtt for now and monitor on tele.  Has history of conversion
   pauses, and had low EF and risk of VT (though no VT hx), for which he
   received pacemaker/ICD, so should monitor for these arrhythmias.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold heparin gtt , and get Head MRI (if he fits into machine) prior
   to initiating heparin
   - metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue home digoxin
   # Hypernatremia:
   Persists.  Has about 8L free water deficit.
   - replete IV and PO per OG tube if we can place OG tube again and
   confirm placement
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI with stent
   placement.  Anatomy as above.
   - Continue statin, aspirin, toprol XL
   # OSA: Intubated, will need home CPAP s/p extubation.
   # Depression: hold wellbutrin and amitriptyline for now.
   - restart prn, post extubation.
   # Gout: on allopurinol.
   # HTN: continue on metoprolol.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home medications.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He also had previous knee replacement surgery. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICD) and is being treated for several medical conditions:

1. MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee: The patient has persistent bacteremia and vegetation on the pacemaker wire. Initially, high-dose ceftriaxone (CTX) and daptomycin were given, but now it is recommended to switch to more standard therapy with nafcillin and rifampin. Gentamicin may be added later.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is on day 5 of intubation and requires a high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Barriers to extubation include mental status, extreme agitation, and the need for a high level of PEEP. A chest CT scan may be considered to rule out septic emboli to the lungs and staphylococcal pneumonia.

3. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has an ejection fraction of 30-40%. He is"

   # MSSA Bacteremia/Vegetation on Pacer wire/Septic Arthritis:
   Cr elevated on admission to NEBH prompting treatment with high dose
   CTX/daptomycin.  Patient is persistently febrile, however, with
   persistent bacteremia through [**2-16**] and Cr has improved suggesting that
   it would now be reasonable to opt for more standard therapy with
   nafcillin/gent/rifampin.  At this point, will add nafcillin, but will
   hold on gent/rifampin and discuss with ID regarding timing of adding
   those therapies as well as duration of therapy.  Ortho consulted
   yesterday.  Knees do not appear warm or swollen.  Coag Neg staph also
   grown in blood cultures at OSH.
   - Continue Nafcillin, per ID recs
   - start Vancomycin for Coag Neg staph ; ask ID whether should continue
   both Nafcillin and Vanc once Vanc trough appropriate
   - Wound Care for knee, per Ortho Recs
   - if knee worsens or looks infected in next 24-48 hours, call Ortho
   again b/c of possibility of another nidus of infection
   - Consider TEE to look for valve vegetations as another nidus of
   infection; ask TEE fellow if worthwhile
   - hold rifampin and gent for now
   - daily cultures while febrile
   - ID consult appreciated
   # Respiratory Failure, s/p Intubation:
   Day#5 of Intubation.  Barriers to extubation include mental status,
   extreme agitation, and high level of PEEP required.  Appears to be
   ventilating well.  Could use a little diuresis prior to extubation.
   - gentle diuresis
   - decreased sedation to evaluate mental status and attempt pressure
   support trial
   - slowly decrease PEEP so as not to derecruit alveoli
   - Consider Chest CT for e/o septic emboli to the lungs and staph
   pneumonia if respiratory status worsens, or have difficulty with
   extubation.

   # Chronic Systolic CHF:
   EF 30-40%. JVP difficult to assess, but CXR shows mild fluid overload.
   - gentle diuresis today

   # Hx Atrial Fibrillation:  On coumadin at home and OSH ECG's suggest
   possible A. flutter.  Patient at high risk for systemic embolization
   given septic knee, high grade bacteremia, although most likely source
   for emboli is the lungs.  As such, would hold anticoagulation with
   heparin gtt for now and monitor on tele.  Has history of conversion
   pauses, and had low EF and risk of VT (though no VT hx), for which he
   received pacemaker/ICD, so should monitor for these arrhythmias.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold heparin gtt and consider head CT prior to initiating heparin
   - metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue home digoxin
   # Hypernatremia:
   Persists.  Has about 8L free water deficit.
   - replete IV and PO per OG tube if we can place OG tube again and
   confirm placement
   # CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI with stent
   placement.  Anatomy as above.
   - Continue statin, aspirin, toprol XL

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and received a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He also had knee replacement surgery in the past. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications, including MSSA lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee, respiratory failure, chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and a history of depression, gout, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis of the spine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA lead infection and septic arthritis of the left knee: The patient has persistent bacteremia and vegetation on the pacemaker wire. There is a need for continued antibiotic therapy with nafcillin, and the possibility of adding vancomycin for coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection. Wound care for the knee is also recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on day #5 of intubation due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include mental status, extreme agitation, and high levels of PEEP required. Gentle diuresis may be helpful prior to extubation. Decreasing sedation and pressure support trial should be considered. A chest CT may be necessary if respiratory status worsens or there is difficulty with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD), and recent septic arthritis that was washed out. He was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, he has MSSA and CNSA bacteremia, likely secondary to the initial septic joint. Ongoing fevers are concerning for a potential ongoing infection.

Secondly, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The main barriers to extubation have been mental status and high PEEP requirement. The ABG indicates that he does not actually need such high PEEP, so the PEEP should be titrated down to maintain PaO2 >60. A trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) after PEEP weaning should be considered, and the patient should be sedated with presidex peri-extubation.

Thirdly, there is a concern for a foreign body in the right atrium, possibly a septic vegetation leftover from a recent line infection. A CT with contrast should be done to evaluate further, and discuss with cardiology possible procedure to remove.

Fourthly, the patient is experiencing abdominal pain, and concern for intra-abdominal infectious process including septic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including antibiotics, pain management, prophylactic anticoagulation, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could potentially progress to delirium, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
2. Worsening Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a decline in oxygenation or ventilation parameters.
3. Sepsis Progression: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient's sepsis could progress to septic shock or organ dysfunction if not effectively managed.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent further complications related to electrolyte imbalance.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The impaired skin integrity indicates the need for regular repositioning and pressure ulcer prevention strategies to prevent further deterioration.
6. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT,"

   59 y/o man hx CAD, s/p CABG w/ PPM/ICD, recent septic arthritis s/p
   washout, now with MSSA and VR coag negative staph bacteremia,
   transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning from vent.
   .
   # Repiratory failure: Successful SBT, mental status is clear now, but
   variable throughout the day, doing well on 0-5 of PEEP.
   - Wean Fentanyl to Fentanyl patch for pain rather than sedation
   - Extubation with difficult airway cart present
   - Precidex for sedation
   .
   # MSSA and CNSA Bacteremia:  Likely secondary to septic joint
   initially. Ongoing fevers are concerning for a nidus of infection still
   present.
   - continue vancomycin and nafcillin
   - f/u ID recs regarding possibly changing to daptomycin
   - may need r/o septic emboli given AMS
   - daily surveillance cx
   .
   # foreign body in R atrium: differential includes thrombus vs foreign
   body.  Most likely may be septic vegetation left over from recent LIJ.
   - CT with contrast to evaluate further
   - discuss with cardiology possible procedure to remove
   .
   # abdominal pain:  patient wincing on exam.  Concern for
   intra-abdominal infectious process including septic emboli.
   - abdominal CT with contrast
   .
   # altered mental status:  most likely ICU delirium with contributions
   from pain and versed, improving
   - Wean as above
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: hx afib on coumadin with rate control as
   outpatient.  Heparin currently being held.  Metoprolol and digoxin have
   also been held today given concern for OG tube placement.
   - hold heparin gtt until head CT to r/o bleed
   - metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue digoxin
   .
   # hypernatremia:  sodium 150 with free water deficit of 8L this
   morning.
   - change to free water via OG tube
   # hx CAD
   - Continue statin, aspirin, toprol XL
   .
   # OSA: Intubated, will need home CPAP s/p extubation.
   .
   # Depression: hold welbutrin and amitriptyline for now.
   - restart prn.
   .
   # Gout: on allopurinol.
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue on metoprolol
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue home medications.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was implanted with a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He also had a recent septic arthritis that required washout and now presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and vancomycin-resistant coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. He was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, foreign body in the right atrium, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory failure: Successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), mental status is clear now, but variable throughout the day, doing well on 0-5 of PEEP. Wean fentanyl to fentanyl patch for pain rather than sedation, extubation with difficult airway cart present, and use Precidex for sedation.
2. MSSA and CNSA bacteremia: Likely secondary to septic joint initially. Ongoing fevers are concerning for a nidus of infection still present. Continue vancomycin and nafcillin, follow ID recs regarding possibly changing to daptomycin, may need rule out septic emb"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, low ejection fraction, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease, and recent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis. He has been intubated since February 11th and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for ventilator management. The patient's mental status has been poor, and he has had high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure and may require continued ventilator support or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is indicated by a high sodium level. This can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility and lack of proper nutrition.
4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, likely secondary to a recent MSSA septic arthritis. There is a concern for bacteremia or a foreign body causing the infection.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, suggesting possible liver dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), low ejection fraction (EF), an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and recent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis. The patient has been intubated since February 11th and was transferred from the critical care unit (CCU) to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for ventilator management. The patient's mental status has been poor, and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements have been a barrier to extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Barriers to extubation include poor mental status and high PEEP requirements.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia. This condition requires careful management to prevent neurological complications.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and other skin-related complications.
4. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. This condition requires prompt management to prevent progression to septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, low ejection fraction, an implanted cardiac defibrillator (AICD), coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), recent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis, and AICD vegetation that was surgically removed.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been intubated since February 11th for ventilator management due to respiratory failure. There are barriers to extubation, including poor mental status and the need for high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's condition appears to be much improved in the morning without agitation.

The patient is on various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Nafcillin), anticoagulation therapy with Heparin, and other ICU medications such as Fentanyl, Famotidine, and Propofol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/68 mmHg to 149/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a complex medical history including morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), low ejection fraction (EF), an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and recent methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) septic arthritis. The patient has been intubated since February 11th and transferred from the coronary care unit (CCU) to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for ventilator management.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's barriers to extubation have been poor mental status and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirement. However, there seems to be much improvement by this morning without agitation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 138/68 mmHg to 149/72 mmHg, heart rate between 61-95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL, spontaneous Vt of 852 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 17, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 220.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and no peripheral edema. The patient follows some commands neurologically.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), platelet (Plt) count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), lactate, and lactic acid levels. Imaging shows an endotracheal tube (ETT) just above the clavicles and bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status (not delirium), hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The plan includes weaning sedation with the goal of extubation today, difficult intubation noted, recheck liver function tests (LFTs) today, consider abdominal ultrasound (abd u/s), review chest CT about the foreign body, restart heparin gtt"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) removed. He also had a recent septic arthritis that was treated with washout and is now presenting with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and vancomycin-resistant coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Altered mental status (not delirium)
2. Hypernatremia (high sodium)
3. Impaired skin integrity
4. Respiratory failure, acute (not acute respiratory distress syndrome)
5. Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed:

1. MSSA and coag-negative Staph bacteremia: Secondary to septic joint. Ongoing fevers are concerning for a nidus of infection still present. Continue vancomycin and nafcillin, follow-up with ID recommendations, daily surveillance cultures, discuss hardware removal with orthopedics, and place PICC line.
2. Foreign body in right atrium: Likely fibrin sheath from pacer wire. Per ID, okay to treat through, no need to remove.

   Assessment and Plan
   59M with CAD, CHF, septic arthritis, infected AICD s/p explant, course
   complicated by respiratory failure, extubated yesterday without
   problems. Only active issue is management of chronic infections.
   Will discuss with ID further work-up, interventions, and treatments.
   Overall, will need to treat with vancomycin for 7 days and nafcillin
   for at least 6 weeks. Checking a vanco trough today.
      - will eventually need definitive treatment for infected hardware in
   the  knee.
   PICC line requested and will removed central line and a-line. PT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), septic arthritis, and an infected implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that was recently explanted. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure but was successfully extubated without any issues.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and nafcillin), insulin, heparin (prophylaxis), famotidine, digoxin, fentanyl, thiamine, allopurinol, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/64 mmHg to 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but otherwise, most other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient has a history of obesity and edema in both lower extremities.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of chronic infections, specifically the infected hardware in the patient's knee. The patient will continue to receive vancomycin for 7 days and nafcillin for at least 6 weeks. Further work-up, interventions, and treatments will be discussed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) removal. He presented with septic arthritis of the left knee, which was treated with washout and identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He now has MSSA bacteremia and is being monitored in the ICU. The patient also has a foreign body in the right atrium, likely due to a fibrin sheath from a pacer wire. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin with rate control. The patient's other medical conditions include CAD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), depression, gout, hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia. He is currently on cardiac diet and receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His code status is full code, and he is awaiting a floor bed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent the progression of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired lung sounds and decreased oxygen saturation. Respiratory failure may be a concern, especially if there is underlying ARDS or another lung pathology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor and muscle pain. He received antibiotics (Vancomycin and Nafcillin) and various ICU medications including Famotidine, Heparin Sodium, and Morphine Sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 4,016 mL total intake, 2,600 mL oral intake, 1,416 mL IV fluid intake, and 1,710 mL total output. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 146 mg/dL, and laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and potassium levels. The patient's creatinine, total CO2, and calcium levels are within normal range. The patient has received respiratory support but is currently not on supplemental oxygen. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to the presence of multiple medical complications. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis, electrolyte imbalances"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), septic arthritis, and an infected implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) who was recently explanted. He experienced respiratory failure but was successfully extubated two days ago without any issues. The only active concern at this time is the management of chronic infections. The patient also has rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a RA fibrin sheath likely related to a prior ICD wire.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Staph bacteremia with RA fibrin sheath:
   - The patient has been diagnosed with Staph bacteremia due to the RA fibrin sheath.
   - Treatment includes vancomycin for 7 days and nafcillin for at least 6 weeks.
   - Definitive treatment for infected hardware in the knee will be needed eventually.
   - A PICC line needs to be placed due to the patient's weight, and bedside fluoro may be necessary.
   - Clarification regarding anticoagulation is needed.
2. RA fibrin sheath:
   - Prolonged antibiotic treatment as mentioned above is required.
   - No intervention is planned according to cardiac consultation.
   - It needs to be clarified whether anticoagulation is needed, and consultation with the cardiology team will be done."
