   presenting to ED with acute onset of flank pain.  Workup in the ED
   revealed right kidney with intraparenchymal and subcapsular
   hemorrhage.  Since admission to the floor, he has received a total of 3
   units PRBC's and 6 units FFP in attempt to support patient and reverse
   INR.  Patients urine output has continued to fall and he remains
   minimally responsive to high dose Lasix bolluses.  Patient also began
   to experience asymptomatic episodes of wide complex, irregular
   tachycardia with alternating axis
   24 Hour Events:
   - CT abd/pelvis: no significant change from prior study, areas of
   subcapsular and intraparenchymal hemorrhage without sig. increase in RP
   hematoma, small right pleural effusion, increased opacity at left lung
   base c/w atelectasis vs. aspiration
   - renal recs: urine sediment c/w ATN, dose meds for GFR = 0, agree w/
   diuretic trial
   - urology recs: reverse INR, f/u CT on Monday, follow serial HCT, will
   require MR in 3 months for further evaluation
   - bladder pressure inc. to 21 (stable), general surgery contact[**Name (NI) **] which
   reports no intervention unless > 30
   - HCT  trends down: 38.6 -> 29.5 -> 27.0 -> 25.3 -> 20.2 (1 unit) ->
   21.0 (2 units)-> 26.2 = 3 units total
   - INR trends down: 2.5 -> 2.3 -> 2.4 -> 2.2 -> 1.8 = 6 units FFP
   - Lasix boluses 80mg then 120 mg with UOP around 30 cc/hr
   - episode of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with shifting axis,
   electrolytes normal, patient asymptomatic and exam unremarkable, VSS,
   cardiac enzymes cycled and 1st set normal

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   .
   (#) Hypoxia: improving; patient already down to 6LNC in the ICU.
   Evidence of volume overload on CXR.  Patient also had emesis and,
   though he is not at especially high risk, may have had an aspiration
   event.  He has not gotten an extra large amount of volume aside from
   the 4 units total of FFP.  He has now received lasix 20, then 40 mg IV
   though is urine output is only 20 cc over the last three to four
   hours.  (Of note, he did have 300 cc urine recorded in flow sheet at 11
   pm last night.)  Despite to putting out urine, the patient does report
   feeling better.  Low suspicion for PE or other pathology.
   -- cont to wean oxygen and diurese as tolerated
   -- aspiration precautions if he continues to vomit
   -- antiemetics PRN
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE UGIB: Pt had episode of guaiaic positive emesis in context
   of severe cough and post-tussive emesis.  Has been nauseaus since
   admission likely from RP bleed.  Pt has no h/o ETOH abuse, liver
   disease which would be concerning for ascities.  no known ulcer
   disease; denies upper bleed such as epistaxis and dental bleeding.
   - NPO; IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - maintain active T&S
   - Maintain Hct > 25 given large degree of drop from baseline (though
   possibly hemoconcentrated on admission)
   - possible GI c/s re: UGI
   .
   (#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Differential diagnosis broad at this point.
   No recent trauma. Causes of RP bleed could include: renal maignancy,
   pyelonephritis +/- abscess, vascular disease, rupture of renal cyst.
   Subcapsular and intraparenchymal bleed makes intrinsic kidney etiology
   most likely. Exophytic lesion on upper pole noted on CT (12->22mm since
   [**2188**]) but unrelated to current bleed. Bleed most likely exacerbated by
   warfarin (although not supratherapeutic INR ~2.5) and daily baby
   aspirin (functional platelet abnormalities).  Urology is following.
   Decreased urine output is concerning for progression of bleed affecting
   renal perfusion, and Cr has bumped from 2.3 --> 4.5 overnight.
   -- will call urology this am to touch base about the decreased urine
   output
   -- will give another 2 units FFP given possible progression of bleed
   -- cont holding warfarin, aspirin
   -- would lke to give RBC transfusion, but will hold given volume
   .
   (#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: unclear what his baseline is (seems
   to be in mid 2's); acute change with minimal UOP in last few hours is
   concerning for progression of the hematoma compromising blood flow to
   the kidney or IVC; also has a mildly elevated lactate.
   -- will repeat pelvis CT scan
   -Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO DAILY
   -- renal diet when restarted
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE AMI: ST changes on EKG ordered for eval of nausea (not CP,
   albeit pt is diabetic) were considered ""artifact"" by cards fellow and
   normalized on repeat EKG.
   -- CE ordered with am labs though low suspicion will be positive
   -- cont statin; hold ASA given bleed
   .
   (#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  WBC currently 13.6 with left shift. Infection
   is highest on differential, although stress reaction to acute bleed,
   inflammatory, and neoplastic disease are also possible. No evidence fo
   PNA currently (though may have had an aspirtaion event last night).
   -- continue to monitor
   -- Check urine culture, blood culture
   .
   # CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2188**] echo): Pt
   reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain. Known systolic
   dysfunction although LVEF in [**2188**] >55%.
   -Strict I's and O's
   -monitor respiratory status, vital signs
   -- might consider repeat echo
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2186**]
   (defibrillated 1x).
   -holding coumadin
   -continue telemetry
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].
   -HISS
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 1936**] of [**Last Name (un) 303**] folows his DM, as pt is on a study drug for
   kidney disease
   .
   #HTN: Currently stable though on low side with possible IVC compression
   from hematoma.  Will be cautious with antihypertensives in setting of
   bleed.
   - furosemide according to BP parameters
   -hold metoprolol and valsartan, reasses if needed
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Stable, continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   .
   #Gout: continue allopurinol

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented to the emergency department with acute onset flank pain and was found to have right kidney intraparenchymal and subcapsular hemorrhage. He has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma in an attempt to support his blood pressure and reverse the effects of warfarin. Despite these interventions, the patient's urine output continues to decline, and he remains minimally responsive to high-dose lasix boluses. 

The patient also experienced episodes of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with alternating axis. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed no significant change in the size of the hematoma. The patient has a small right pleural effusion and increased opacity at the left lung base, which could be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Renal recipients have confirmed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and agree with a diuretic trial. Urology recommendations include reversing INR, following up with a CT scan on Monday, and conducting serial hemoglobin checks. The patient's bladder pressure has increased to 21 mmHg, and there is no need for any further intervention unless it exceeds 30 mmHg.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been trending downward, from 38.6 g/dL to 29.5 g"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney of unknown etiology.  Bleed appears stable with
   serial imaging.  Falling urine output and rising Cr (2.3 to 5.8) likely
   causing ATN via poor perfusion and ARF.  Patient is now s/p 3 units

   - renally dose all medications
   ## Hypoxia:  patient initially presented with desaturations in the ED
   with concern for volume overload as evidenced by CXR.  Patient had TTE
   performed to evaluate for cardiac function which was limited but which
   did not suggest decompensated heart failure.  Of note, patient also has
   history of obstructive lung disease and requires BiPAP at night for
   OSA.  Patient now saturating in low-mid 90

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and diabetes mellitus type II (DM-II). He presented to the emergency department with acute onset of flank pain and was found to have right kidney with intraparenchymal and subcapsular hemorrhage. The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to support his hemodynamics and reverse INR. Despite this, his urine output has continued to fall, and he remains minimally responsive to high-dose Lasix boluses. The patient also experienced asymptomatic episodes of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with alternating axis.

Medical Complications:
1. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has an intraparenchymal/subcapsular bleed of the right kidney of unknown etiology. The bleed appears stable with serial imaging. Falling urine output and rising creatinine (Cr) likely causing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) via poor perfusion and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has received 3 units of PRBCs and 6 units of FFP to support hemodynamics and reverse INR. Hold on repeat CT scan as the patient does not appear stable for the study. Consult with urology regarding the need for CT and how it would change management. Trend bladder pressures for concern of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented to the emergency department with acute onset flank pain. The workup revealed a right kidney with intraparenchymal and subcapsular hemorrhage. The patient has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to support his hemodynamics and reverse the elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient's urine output has continued to fall despite receiving high-dose Lasix boluses. Additionally, he has experienced asymptomatic episodes of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with alternating axis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 99 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 98/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on CPAP mask.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.9 thousand/mm^3, elevated hemoglobin concentration of 26.2%, and elevated creatinine levels ranging from 4.5 to 5.8 mg/dL. The troponin-T levels have also been elevated, suggesting possible myocardial injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney of unknown etiology.  Bleed appears stable with
   serial imaging.  Falling urine output and rising Cr (2.3 to 5.8) likely
   causing ATN via poor perfusion and ARF.  Patient is now s/p 3 units
   PRBC
s and 6 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse INR.
   - repeat CT scan this AM to evaluate for interval change
   - q 8  HCT w/ PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   goal < 1.9
   - hold ASA and coumadin
   ## Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: patient with marginal UOP s/p Lasix
   bolus, rising Cr and sediment c/w ATN
   - hold Lasix bolus for now considering rising Cr
   - f/u renal re: management of progressive ARF w/ poor UOP in the
   setting of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   - renally dose all medications
   ## Hypoxia:  patient initially presented with desaturations in the ED
   with concern for volume overload as evidenced by CXR.  Patient had TTE
   performed to evaluate for cardiac function which was limited but which
   did not suggest decompensated heart failure.  Of note, patient also has
   history of obstructive lung disease and requires BiPAP at night for
   OSA.  Patient now saturating in low-mid 90
s on 4L NC.
   - continue to wean oxygen requirements as tolerated
   - consider antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA given episode of
   emesis if continued clinical deterioration or worsening CXR
   ## Concern for UGIB:  patient had single reported episode of guiac
   positive post-tussive emesis in setting of severe cough.  Of note,
   patient has no risk factors variceal bleed and no history suggestive of
   UGIB.  Suspicion for UGIB is very low.
   - check stool guiac
 if positive will require GI consult
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] for now
   - maintain active T & S
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - attempt rate control with metoprolol
   - consult EP for pacer interrogation
   - continue to holding ASA in setting of RP bleed
   ## Fever / Leukocytosis:  WBC continues to remain elevated without
   obvious infectious source.  This may represent demargination from
   generalized inflammatory response given RP bleed.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and CXR
   # CHF: unclear to extent of disease with last documented LVEF > 55%.
   TTE performed on day of admission was not suggestive of decompensated
   HF.
   - continue strict I and O
   - continue scheduled albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - consider formal echo for better evaluation of cardiac function
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Sugars have been poorly controlled in the mid-upper 200
   - consider increasing AM Lantus dosing for improved basal coverage with
   HISS for breakthrough

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He presented to the emergency department with acute onset of flank pain and was found to have intraparenchymal and subcapsular hemorrhage of the right kidney. The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to support his hemodynamics and reverse INR. Despite this, the patient's urine output continues to fall, and he remains minimally responsive to high-dose Lasix boluses. The patient also experiences asymptomatic episodes of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with alternating axis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels and oliguria suggest a decline in kidney function, possibly due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's marginal urine output and rising creatinine indicate worsening renal function, which may be contributing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This may be due to volume overload or underlying obstructive lung disease.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The presence of leukocytosis and fever raises"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney of unknown etiology.  Bleed appears stable with
   serial imaging.  Falling urine output and rising Cr (2.3 to 5.8) likely
   causing ATN via poor perfusion and ARF.  Patient is now s/p 3 units
   PRBC
s and 6 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse INR.
   - repeat CT scan this AM to evaluate for interval change
   - q 8  HCT w/ PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   goal < 1.9
   - hold ASA and coumadin
   ## Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: patient with marginal UOP s/p Lasix
   bolus, rising Cr and sediment c/w ATN
   - hold Lasix bolus for now considering rising Cr
   - f/u renal re: management of progressive ARF w/ poor UOP in the
   setting of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   - renally dose all medications
   (#) Hypoxia: improving; patient already down to 6LNC in the ICU.
   Evidence of volume overload on CXR.  Patient also had emesis and,
   though he is not at especially high risk, may have had an aspiration
   event.  He has not gotten an extra large amount of volume aside from
   the 4 units total of FFP.  He has now received lasix 20, then 40 mg IV
   though is urine output is only 20 cc over the last three to four
   hours.  (Of note, he did have 300 cc urine recorded in flow sheet at 11
   pm last night.)  Despite to putting out urine, the patient does report
   feeling better.  Low suspicion for PE or other pathology.
   -- cont to wean oxygen and diurese as tolerated
   -- aspiration precautions if he continues to vomit
   -- antiemetics PRN
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE UGIB: Pt had episode of guaiaic positive emesis in context
   of severe cough and post-tussive emesis.  Has been nauseaus since
   admission likely from RP bleed.  Pt has no h/o ETOH abuse, liver
   disease which would be concerning for ascities.  no known ulcer
   disease; denies upper bleed such as epistaxis and dental bleeding.
   - NPO; IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - maintain active T&S
   - Maintain Hct > 25 given large degree of drop from baseline (though
   possibly hemoconcentrated on admission)
   - possible GI c/s re: UGI
   .
   (#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Differential diagnosis broad at this point.
   No recent trauma. Causes of RP bleed could include: renal maignancy,
   pyelonephritis +/- abscess, vascular disease, rupture of renal cyst.
   Subcapsular and intraparenchymal bleed makes intrinsic kidney etiology
   most likely. Exophytic lesion on upper pole noted on CT (12->22mm since
   [**2188**]) but unrelated to current bleed. Bleed most likely exacerbated by
   warfarin (although not supratherapeutic INR ~2.5) and daily baby
   aspirin (functional platelet abnormalities).  Urology is following.
   Decreased urine output is concerning for progression of bleed affecting
   renal perfusion, and Cr has bumped from 2.3 --> 4.5 overnight.
   -- will call urology this am to touch base about the decreased urine
   output
   -- will give another 2 units FFP given possible progression of bleed
   -- cont holding warfarin, aspirin
   -- would lke to give RBC transfusion, but will hold given volume
   .
   (#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: unclear what his baseline is (seems
   to be in mid 2's); acute change with minimal UOP in last few hours is
   concerning for progression of the hematoma compromising blood flow to
   the kidney or IVC; also has a mildly elevated lactate.
   -- will repeat pelvis CT scan
   -Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO DAILY
   -- renal diet when restarted
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE AMI: ST changes on EKG ordered for eval of nausea (not CP,
   albeit pt is diabetic) were considered ""artifact"" by cards fellow and
   normalized on repeat EKG.
   -- CE ordered with am labs though low suspicion will be positive
   -- cont statin; hold ASA given bleed
   .
   (#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  WBC currently 13.6 with left shift. Infection
   is highest on differential, although stress reaction to acute bleed,
   inflammatory, and neoplastic disease are also possible. No evidence fo
   PNA currently (though may have had an aspirtaion event last night).
   -- continue to monitor
   -- Check urine culture, blood culture
   .
   # CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2188**] echo): Pt
   reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain. Known systolic
   dysfunction although LVEF in [**2188**] >55%.
   -Strict I's and O's
   -monitor respiratory status, vital signs
   -- might consider repeat echo
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2186**]
   (defibrillated 1x).
   -holding coumadin
   -continue telemetry
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].
   -HISS
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 1936**] of [**Last Name (un) 303**] folows his DM, as pt is on a study drug for
   kidney disease
   .
   #HTN: Currently stable though on low side with possible IVC compression
   from hematoma.  Will be cautious with antihypertensives in setting of
   bleed.
   - furosemide according to BP parameters
   -hold metoprolol and valsartan, reasses if needed
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Stable, continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney of unknown etiology.  Bleed appears stable with
   serial imaging.  Falling urine output and rising Cr (2.3 to 5.8) likely
   causing ATN via poor perfusion and ARF.  Patient is now s/p 3 units
   PRBC
s and 6 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse INR.
   - repeat CT scan this AM to evaluate for interval change
   - q 8  HCT w/ PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   goal < 1.9
   - hold ASA and coumadin
   - continue to trend bladder pressures for concern of abdominal
   compartment syndrome in setting of worsening renal function and ongoing
   RP bleed
   ## Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: patient with marginal UOP s/p Lasix
   bolus, rising Cr and sediment c/w ATN
   - hold Lasix bolus for now considering rising Cr
   - f/u renal re: management of progressive ARF w/ poor UOP in the
   setting of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   - renally dose all medications
   ## Hypoxia:  patient initially presented with desaturations in the ED
   with concern for volume overload as evidenced by CXR.  Patient had TTE
   performed to evaluate for cardiac function which was limited but which
   did not suggest decompensated heart failure.  Of note, patient also has
   history of obstructive lung disease and requires BiPAP at night for
   OSA.  Patient now saturating in low-mid 90
s on 4L NC.
   - continue to wean oxygen requirements as tolerated
   - consider antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA given episode of
   emesis if continued clinical deterioration or worsening CXR
   ## Concern for UGIB:  patient had single reported episode of guiac
   positive post-tussive emesis in setting of severe cough.  Of note,
   patient has no risk factors variceal bleed and no history suggestive of
   UGIB.  Suspicion for UGIB is very low.
   - check stool guiac
 if positive will require GI consult
   - continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**] for now
   - maintain active T & S
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - attempt rate control with metoprolol
   - consult EP for pacer interrogation
   - continue to holding ASA in setting of RP bleed
   ## Fever / Leukocytosis:  WBC continues to remain elevated without
   obvious infectious source.  This may represent demargination from
   generalized inflammatory response given RP bleed.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and CXR
   # CHF: unclear to extent of disease with last documented LVEF > 55%.
   TTE performed on day of admission was not suggestive of decompensated
   HF.
   - continue strict I and O
   - continue scheduled albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - consider formal echo for better evaluation of cardiac function
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Sugars have been poorly controlled in the mid-upper 200
   - consider increasing AM Lantus dosing for improved basal coverage with
   HISS for breakthrough
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 1936**] from [**Name (NI) 631**] re: DM management

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus type II.
- He presented to the emergency department with acute onset of flank pain and was found to have intraparenchymal and subcapsular hemorrhage in the right kidney.
- The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to support hemodynamics and reverse INR.
- Despite the transfusions, the patient's urine output continued to fall, and he remains minimally responsive to high-dose Lasix boluses.
- The patient also experienced episodes of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with alternating axis.
- A CT abdomen/pelvis showed no significant change from the prior study, with areas of subcapsular and intraparenchymal hemorrhage without significant increase in renal hematoma.
- There is a small right pleural effusion and increased opacity at the left lung base, suggestive of atelectasis versus aspiration.
- Renal records indicate urine sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with medication dosing for GFR = 0, in agreement with diuretic trial.
- Urology recommendations include reversing INR, following up with a CT on Monday, and monitoring serial hematocrit (HCT)"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented to the emergency department with acute onset flank pain and was found to have intraparenchymal and subcapsular hemorrhage of the right kidney. The patient received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to support his hemodynamics and reverse INR.

Since admission to the floor, the patient's urine output has continued to fall, and he remains minimally responsive to high-dose Lasix boluses. He also experiences asymptomatic episodes of wide complex, irregular tachycardia with alternating axis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 98/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on CPAP mask.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 25.3 g/dL, platelet count of 158 K/uL, creatinine of 5.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 244 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Was desaturating on ventilator, w/ PaO2s in the 70s - 80s on 100%
   FiO2.  Unclear what's causing low saturations but likely
   multifactorial.  Abdominal distension may reduce chest wall compliance,
   leading to hypoxemia.  Secondly, he may have underlying pulmonary edema
   given his biventricular heart failure and that he received multiple
   RBCS + FFPs.  He may also have an underlying  infectious process (white
   count has been trending up, has been febrile, and respiratory sputum is
   growing  4+ gram negative rods and 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains. Finally, the patient is frequently overbreathing the ventilator
   and appears to be in dyssynchrony with the ventilator.
   -Blood gas has improved considerably this AM on higher PEEP, lower
   tidal volumes, and adjustment of ET tube.  Could decrease FiO2 and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  If in next
   two days, no improvement clinically, consider switching to HAP
   coverage.
   -Given reduced systolic function (EF of 40%) in setting of multiple
   blood products, could be fluid overloaded although radiographically
   doesn
t appear to be so.  Overall is 3 L positive.  Given that he is
   currently getting CVVH, [**Male First Name (un) **]
t need to aggressively diurese.  Can adjust
   rate of CVVH to keep him slightly negative.
   -Increase sedation as necessary to reduce dyssynchrony.
   .
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for INR
   goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - f/u urology recs
   -Not going for CT given unstable respiratory status
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has creatinine of 6.4, in
   past two days has ranged from 5.3 -> 7.2.   Baseline creatinine is <
   3.  Given chronic kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting
   of GI bleed, may have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led
   to ATN.   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further
   compromised renal function;
   - Renal following: underwent CVVH starting yesterday.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   ## Fever / Leukocytosis:  WBC continues to remain elevated and could be
   secondary to a pneumonia as the patient is growing gram
 rods and gram
   + cocci in sputum.
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and CXR
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Doesn
t seem to have an active UG bleed as HCT is stable
   and does not look like frank blood.  Likely secondary to old prior
   bleed; source unclear.
   -Would continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Sugars have been poorly controlled in the mid-upper 200
   - Despite increase in AM basal coverage and uptitration of ISS,
   continues to have sugars 200s
 300s.  Can try insulin drip for more
   optimal control.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, and systolic CHF. He presented with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and desaturation. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and continues to experience hypoxemia despite adjustments in ventilator settings. The patient also has renal failure, an elevated white blood cell count, and fever, which may indicate an infectious process. He received blood products and fresh frozen plasma to address his coagulopathy and reverse anticoagulation therapy. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including potential pulmonary edema, fluid overload, pneumonia, and a possible retroperitoneal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels persist despite adjustments in ventilator settings. This could be due to underlying pulmonary edema, an infectious process, or dyssynchrony with the ventilator.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in the sputum suggests a possible pneumonia. The patient is being covered for community-acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and recent blood product transfusions may have contributed to fluid overload. This should be carefully managed to avoid worsening of renal function.

4. Retroperitoneal Ble"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Was desaturating on ventilator, w/ PaO2s in the 70s - 80s on 100%
   FiO2.  Unclear what's causing low saturations but likely
   multifactorial.  Abdominal distension may reduce chest wall compliance,
   leading to hypoxemia.  Secondly, he may have underlying pulmonary edema
   given his biventricular heart failure and that he received multiple
   RBCS + FFPs.  He may also have an underlying  infectious process (white
   count has been trending up, has been febrile, and respiratory sputum is
   growing  4+ gram negative rods and 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains. Finally, the patient is frequently overbreathing the ventilator
   and appears to be in dyssynchrony with the ventilator.
   -Blood gas has improved considerably this AM on higher PEEP, lower
   tidal volumes, and adjustment of ET tube.  Could decrease FiO2 and PEEP
   as tolerated.
   -Respiratory sputum growing gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  If in next
   two days, no improvement clinically, consider switching to HAP
   coverage.
   -Given reduced systolic function (EF of 40%) in setting of multiple
   blood products, could be fluid overloaded although radiographically
   doesn
t appear to be so.  Overall is 3 L positive.  Given that he is
   currently getting CVVH, can adjust rate of CVVH to remove -0.5
 1 L of
   fluid daily.
   -Increase sedation as necessary to reduce dyssynchrony.
   .
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - q 6  HCT w/ PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - f/u urology recs
   -Not going for CT given unstable respiratory status
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has creatinine of 6.4, in
   past two days has ranged from 5.3 -> 7.2.   Baseline creatinine is <
   3.  Given chronic kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting
   of GI bleed, may have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led
   to ATN.   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further
   compromised renal function;
   - Renal following: underwent CVVH starting yesterday.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   ## Fever / Leukocytosis:  WBC continues to remain elevated and could be
   secondary to a pneumonia as the patient is growing gram
 rods and gram
   + cocci in sputum.
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone
   - f/u blood and urine cultures and CXR
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Doesn
t seem to have an active UG bleed as HCT is stable
   and does not look like frank blood.  Likely secondary to old prior
   bleed; source unclear.
   -Would continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Sugars have been poorly controlled in the mid-upper 200
   - Despite increase in AM basal coverage and uptitration of ISS,
   continues to have sugars 200s
 300s.  Can try insulin drip for more
   optimal control.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 69-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), presented with chest discomfort and shortness of breath. His troponin levels began to rise, indicating a possible myocardial infarction (MI). The patient was intubated due to desaturation and the use of accessory muscles. Despite intubation, he continued to desaturate, leading to adjustments in ventilator settings and the placement of an esophageal balloon to measure transpulmonary pressures.

The patient's abdominal pressure was high at 26 mmHg, which was reduced to 19 mmHg after placing an orogastric (OG) tube and aspirating fluid. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The patient's labs showed elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, increased creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose. His coagulation profile revealed a high international normalized ratio (INR), indicating a bleeding risk. The patient received packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions to reverse the INR and support hemodynamics.

The patient's condition remains complex, with multiple potential complications including hypoxia, acute kidney injury (AKI), gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with adjustments made to improve oxygenation. Antibiotics have been initiated for suspected pneumonia, and the patient is being closely monitored for any changes in vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has underlying  nfectious process
   (white count has been trending up, has been febrile, and respiratory
   sputum is growing  4+ gram negative rods and 2+ gram positive cocci in
   pairs and chains.  Also abdominal distension may reduce chest wall
   compliance, leading to hypoxemia.  Thirdly, he may have underlying
   pulmonary edema given his biventricular heart failure and that he
   received multiple RBCS + FFPs.  He may also have an  Finally, the
   patient is frequently overbreathing the ventilator and was previously
   in dyssynchrony with ventilator although seems to have improved.
   -Blood gas considerably improved this AM on higher PEEP, lower tidal
   volumes.  Currently on 40% FiO2; could decrease PEEP as tolerated.
   Improvement in CXR also suggests that respiratory status improvement
   likely secondary to continued resolution of PNA.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  White count
   still trending up and re-spiked; if by tomorrow WBC has not improved
   and has continued fevers, expand coverage to HAP.
   -Given reduced systolic function (EF of 40%) in setting of multiple
   blood products, could be fluid overloaded although radiographically
   doesn
t appear to be so.  Due to CVVH was -2 L overnight, overall is
   now only 1 L positive.  Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to take off
   maximum 1 L today so to keep him at balance.  No need to aggressively
   diurese.

   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC

   - Renal following: underwent CVVH starting yesterday.   Probably may
   have reached new baseline.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -In addition to PR bisacodyl would add soap suds enema
   -Reglan for short term period (3 days)
   .
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone; adding vancomycin for coverage
   of enterococcal UTI
   -F/u blood, urine, sputum cxs

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, and systolic CHF.
- He presented with acute hemorrhage of the right kidney, hypoxia, and r/o AMI.
- The patient has been febrile, with a white count trending up, and respiratory sputum growing 4+ gram-negative rods and 2+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
- He received multiple RBCs + FFPs, possibly indicating biventricular heart failure.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with higher PEEP and lower tidal volumes, and his CXR suggests continued resolution of PNA.
- The patient is being covered for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but if the WBC does not improve and he continues to have fevers, coverage will be expanded to HAP.
- The patient's fluid status is being managed with CVVH, aiming to keep him at balance.
- He has a retroperitoneal bleed, possibly secondary to cyst rupture in the setting of a high INR from coumadin.
- The patient's creatinine levels have been improving, suggesting chronic kidney disease.
- He underwent CVVH starting yesterday and may have reached a new baseline.
- The patient also has abdominal distension, likely secondary to ileus.
- He is being treated with PR bisacodyl, soap suds enema,"

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.

   sputum is growing  4+ gram negative rods and 2+ gram positive cocci in
   pairs and chains.  Also abdominal distension may reduce chest wall
   compliance, leading to hypoxemia.  Thirdly, he may have underlying
   pulmonary edema given his biventricular heart failure and that he
   received multiple RBCS + FFPs.  He may also have an  Finally, the
   patient is frequently overbreathing the ventilator and was previously
   in dyssynchrony with ventilator although seems to have improved.
   -Blood gas considerably improved this AM on higher PEEP, lower tidal
   volumes.  Currently on 60% FiO2; could decrease PEEP as tolerated.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  White count
   still trending up and re-spiked; if by tomorrow WBC has not improved
   and has continued fevers, expand coverage to HAP.
   -Given reduced systolic function (EF of 40%) in setting of multiple
   blood products, could be fluid overloaded although radiographically
   doesn
t appear to be so.  Due to CVVH was -2 L overnight, overall is
   now only 1 L positive.  Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to take off
   maximum 1 L today so to keep him at balance.  No need to aggressively
   diurese.

   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p

   4.9 -> 4.4.  Given chronic kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in
   setting of GI bleed, may have been hypotensive, which sustained, may
   have led to ATN.   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, and systolic CHF. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxia, suspected AMI, and other medical complications.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which is likely multifactorial in etiology. Factors contributing to this include an underlying infectious process, abdominal distension reducing chest wall compliance, pulmonary edema due to biventricular heart failure, and overbreathing the ventilator.

2. Infection: The patient has been febrile, with an increasing white blood cell count. The sputum gram stain shows growth of 4+ gram-negative rods and 2+ gram-positive cocci, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia.

3. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a history of acute hemorrhage of the right kidney, hypoxia, and r/o AMI. There is a possibility of a retroperitoneal bleed, possibly secondary to cyst rupture in the setting of a high INR from coumadin use.

4. Acute/chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been improving, indicating chronic kidney disease. There is a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sustained hypotension and renal cyst rupture.

   Imaging: Continued resolution of patchy infiltrates bilaterally.
   [**11-3**] CXR: HISTORY: Retroperitoneal bleed and hypoxic respiratory
   failure, now intubated.
   All of the areas of previous multifocal consolidation have either
   cleared or
   substantially improved, though the pace of resolution is much slower in
   the
   right upper lung. Asymmetric pulmonary edema is the most likely
   explanation for the bulk of the abnormality, but aspiration or
   pulmonary hemorrhage may
   have played a role in the right upper lobe. Heart size is normal, and
   there
   is no mediastinal vascular engorgement, no pleural effusion, or
   pneumothorax.
   Lines and tubes in standard placements, unchanged.
   Microbiology: 1/4 bottles of aerobic BCx:  Has gram+ cocci growing in
   pairs and clusters
   urine culture: >100,000 colonies of enterococcus (preliminary)
   sputum gram stain:  4+ gram negative rods, 2+ gram + cocci, and
   respiratory culture shows 2 different species of gram - rods.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has likely underlying pneumonia
   (white count has been trending up, has been febrile, and respiratory
   sputum shows 4+ gram negative rods and 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs
   and chains.  Most likely to be community acquired since developed at
   time of admission and not coming from OSH; also not likely to be
   ventilator acquired since developed prior to being intubated.  Other
   reasons for hypoxia:  Also abdominal distension may reduce chest wall
   compliance, leading to hypoxemia.  Thirdly, he may have underlying
   pulmonary edema given his biventricular heart failure and that he
   received multiple RBCS + FFPs.  Finally, the patient is frequently
   overbreathing the ventilator and was previously in dyssynchrony with
   ventilator although seems to have improved.
   -Blood gas looks good this AM even with PEEP reduced to 20, and  40%
   FiO2; could continue decrease PEEP as tolerated to keep PO2 sats >
   90%.  Further improvement in CXR also suggests that respiratory status
   improvement likely secondary to continued resolution of PNA.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  White count
   still trending up, however respiratory status has improved and CXR
   looks resolved - continue coverage for CAP w/ ceftriaxone +
   azithromycin (day 4 of 8 day course).
   -Given reduced systolic function (EF of 40%) in setting of multiple
   blood products, could be fluid overloaded although radiographically
   doesn
t appear to be so.  Due to CVVH was -0.8 L overnight, overall is
   total -0.8 L.  Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to keep at balance or
   just slightly negative as per renal recs.  No need to aggressively
   diurese.
   .
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinines are steady between 4.0
   and 5.0.  Given chronic kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in
   setting of GI bleed, may have been hypotensive, which sustained, may
   have led to ATN.   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have
   further compromised renal function; may have reached new baseline.
   Continues to be oliguric (made 35 cc of urine yesterday).
   - Renal following: undergoing CVVH.  Probably may have reached new
   baseline.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - f/u urology recs
   .
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -In addition to PR bisacodyl would add soap suds enema
   -Reglan for short term period (3 days)
   -Due to ileus and distension is having difficulties with tube feeds; if
   no resolution of ileus today, may have to consider D/C tube feeds and
   trying TPN.
   .
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.  Started
   on vancomycin yesterday to cover this until we get sensitivities.
   -1/4 bottles is growing GPCs which could be contaminant;  although gram
   stain shows gram + cocci so could be enterococcus.  For now, continue
   coverage with vancomycin (day 2).  Follow-up blood cultures and
   sensitivities.
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone for CAP (day 4 of 8 day course).
   Follow up sputum cultures.
   .
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Doesn
t seem to have an active UG bleed as HCT is stable
   and does not look like frank blood.  Likely secondary to old prior
   bleed; source unclear.
   .
   -Would continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Switched to insulin drip yesterday.  Sugars over past 12 hours
   have all been 100 - 200; would continue drip given improved control.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: d/c allopurinol given constantly fluctuation renal function; can
   restart but give 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally dosed)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes; if BM occurs today can start TF;
   if no BM may have to consider TPN.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has likely underlying pneumonia, which is contributing to their hypoxia. Other reasons for hypoxia include abdominal distension, possibly reducing chest wall compliance, pulmonary edema due to biventricular heart failure, and overbreathing the ventilator.

2. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has steady creatinine levels between 4.0 and 5.0, indicating renal dysfunction. Possible causes include gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hypotension, which may have caused acute tubular necrosis (ATN), as well as a ruptured renal cyst compromising renal function.

3. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has an intraparenchymal/subcapsular bleed of the right kidney, possibly secondary to cyst rupture in the setting of a high INR from coumadin use. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to support hemodynamics and reverse INR.

4. Abdominal Distension: The patient has likely secondary ileus, as indicated by the presence of air and stool in the bowel on abdominal imaging. This may be causing difficulties with tube feeds, and alternative feeding options may need to be considered if the ileus persists.

5. Fevers/Leukocyt"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has likely underlying pneumonia, pulmonary edema, aspiration, or pulmonary hemorrhage contributing to hypoxia. Additionally, the patient's abdominal distension may reduce chest wall compliance, leading to further hypoxemia.

2. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are steady between 4.0 and 5.0, indicating potential acute or chronic renal failure. The patient may have reached a new baseline renal function due to the rupture of a renal cyst and sustained hypotension from gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has an intraparenchymal/subcapsular bleed of the right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in the setting of high INR from coumadin. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse INR and support hemodynamics.

4. Abdominal Distension: The patient likely has ileus as indicated by the presence of air and stool in the bowel on imaging. This can cause difficulties with tube feeds.

5. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and is febrile, suggesting an infection. Possible sources include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infection (UTI),"

   -Goal is negative fluid balance going forward if able
   2)Respiratory Failure-Possible contribution from signficant pneumonia,
   however, in the setting of rapid evolution and resolution of pulmonary
   edema this is concerning for evidence of acute lung injury in the
   setting of significant renal ischemia.
   -Vanco/CTZ/Azithro given concern for infection on day [**5-5**]
   -Will maintain negative fluid balance
   -Will maintain PEEP optimization and continue to wean as possible
   reassuring and with oxygenation stable will continue to wean
   -Will have to follow blood culture results as in the setting of an
   absence of systemic insult contaminant

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, now presenting with renal failure, respiratory failure, and a possible retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's renal failure is acute on chronic and is secondary to a renal bleed, likely from a cyst. The respiratory failure may be due to significant pneumonia, but there is also concern for acute lung injury in the setting of renal ischemia. The patient has been receiving vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (range 92-121 bpm), blood pressure of 104/59 mmHg (range 72-119/47-82 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (range 20-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular paced. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg (range 14-24 mmHg).

The patient has been receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a negative fluid balance. The total input of fluids has been 6040 mL, and the total output has been 6835 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -795 mL. The patient's urine"

   Imaging: From [**11-4**]:
   Exam is limited by exclusion of the periphery of the right mid and
   lower lung
   from the study. An area of poorly defined consolidation in the right
   upper
   lobe appears slightly improved, but there is worsening patchy opacity
   in both
   infrahilar regions. Cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged.
   Indwelling
   devices remain in standard position.
   Microbiology: 4+ gram - rod in sputum: K pneumonia
   2+ GPC in sputum
   Enterococcus in urine sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin.
   1 bottle: coag - staph in blood, likely contaminant
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has underlying Klebsiella
   pneumonia; further cx by fluid overload from receiving multiple BP (has
   CHF) and abdominal distension.
   -Blood gas looks good this AM even with PEEP reduced to 15, and  40%
   FiO2; could continue decrease PEEP to 10, with target of getting to 5
   as tolerated to keep PO2 sats > 90%.  Improvement in consolidation
   suggests that this improvement in respiratory status is due to
   resolution of underlying infection.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered with azithromycin and ceftriaxone which should cover both
   gram + and klebsiella and atypicals.  WBC plateau'd and now falling;
   continue  ceftriaxone + azithromycin (day 5 of 8 day course).
   -Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to keep at balance or just slightly
   negative as per renal recs.  No need to aggressively diurese.
   .
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine continuing to resolve,
   trended down to 3.6.  Cause of ARF likely secondary to ATN secondary to
   sustained hypoTN as well as intraparenchymal bleed.  Given chronic
   kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting of GI bleed, may
   have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led to ATN.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Continues to be
   oliguric (made 5cc /hr of urine yesterday).
   - Renal following: undergoing CVVH.  Probably may have reached new
   baseline.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   .
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Aggressive bowel regimen:   PR bisacodyl, have tried soap suds enema.
   If still failing, can try milk + molasses (brown cow)
   -Reglan for short term period (3 days)
   .
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Continues to be intermittently febrile but has
   largely resolved.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Enterococcus is sensitive to ampicillin; can switch to this and
   continue to finish 10 day course.
   -1/4 bottles is growing GPCs is likely to be contaminant; Follow-up
   blood cultures and sensitivities.
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone for CAP/klebsiella PNA (day 5 of
   8 day course). Follow up sputum cultures.
   .
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Doesn
t seem to have an active UG bleed as HCT is stable
   and does not look like frank blood.  Likely secondary to old prior
   bleed; source unclear.
   .
   -Would continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, acute/chronic renal failure, retroperitoneal bleed, abdominal distension, and concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 

The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) and hypothyroidism. He also has a history of gout. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 114/63 mmHg to 123/63 mmHg, heart rate between 90-105 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His current medications include lantus for DMII, levothyroxine sodium for hypothyroidism, allopurinol for gout, and prophylactic medications such as pneumoboots and IV PPI.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels indicating renal impairment. The imaging studies reveal consolidation in the right upper lobe and patchy op"

   Imaging: From [**11-4**]:
   Exam is limited by exclusion of the periphery of the right mid and
   lower lung
   from the study. An area of poorly defined consolidation in the right
   upper
   lobe appears slightly improved, but there is worsening patchy opacity
   in both
   infrahilar regions. Cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged.
   Indwelling
   devices remain in standard position.
   Microbiology: 4+ gram - rod in sputum: K pneumonia
   2+ GPC in sputum
   Enterococcus in urine sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin.
   1 bottle: coag - staph in blood, likely contaminant
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in
   69 yom with hx of CAD s/p CABG, AF on coumadin with pacer a/w acute
   hemorrhage of right kidney, hypoxia and r/o AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has underlying Klebsiella
   pneumonia; further cx by fluid overload from receiving multiple BP (has
   CHF) and abdominal distension.
   -Blood gas looks good this AM even with PEEP reduced to 15, and  40%
   FiO2; could continue decrease PEEP to 10, with target of getting to 5
   as tolerated to keep PO2 sats > 90%.  Improvement in consolidation
   suggests that this improvement in respiratory status is due to
   resolution of underlying infection.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered with azithromycin and ceftriaxone which should cover both
   gram + and klebsiella and atypicals.  WBC plateau'd and now falling;
   continue  ceftriaxone + azithromycin (day 5 of 8 day course).
   -Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to keep at balance or just slightly
   negative as per renal recs.  No need to aggressively diurese.
   .
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine continuing to resolve,
   trended down to 3.6.  Cause of ARF likely secondary to ATN secondary to
   sustained hypoTN as well as intraparenchymal bleed.  Given chronic
   kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting of GI bleed, may
   have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led to ATN.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Continues to be
   oliguric (made 5cc /hr of urine yesterday).
   - Renal following: undergoing CVVH.  Probably may have reached new
   baseline.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   .
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Aggressive bowel regimen:   PR bisacodyl, have tried soap suds enema.
   If still failing, can try milk + molasses (brown cow)
   -Reglan for short term period (3 days)
   .
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Continues to be intermittently febrile but has
   largely resolved.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Enterococcus is sensitive to ampicillin; can switch to this and
   continue to finish 10 day course.
   -1/4 bottles is growing GPCs is likely to be contaminant; Follow-up
   blood cultures and sensitivities.
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone for CAP/klebsiella PNA (day 5 of
   8 day course). Follow up sputum cultures.
   .
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Doesn
t seem to have an active UG bleed as HCT is stable
   and does not look like frank blood.  Likely secondary to old prior
   bleed; source unclear.
   .
   -Would continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo male with renal failure in the setting of right renal hemorrhage
   in area of previous cyst.  This retroperitoneal bleed has been
   complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure as well as persistent
   renal failure.  He, however, has had minimal evidence of ongoing
   bleeding.
   1)respiratory failure
He has persistent increase in abdominal pressures
   which may limit capacity to wean PEEP and maintain oxygenation.
   -He will have PEEP continued with goal to wean to 10 today with slow
   wean
   -Will need to monitor FIO2, PO2 as we wean
   -Will have to look to maintain negative fluid balance
   -Azithromycin/Vancomycin/CTX for pnuemonia
   2)Renal Failure
Does appear to have chronic compromise and now with new
   insult to right kidney.  He has maintained oliguria across time
   -Will continue with dialysis with likely need for chronic use
   3)Hypotension
septic/hypovolemic
and with persistent decrease in blood
   pressure have been limited in ability to move to negative fluid
   balance
with Klebsiella treated and bleeding stopped would hope for
   improvement across time.
   -Azithromycin/Vancomycin/CTX for likely pulmonary source
   -Levophed to continue to wean
   -Maintain even fluid balance on CVVH
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has renal failure, respiratory failure, and a retroperitoneal bleed. He is currently in the ICU and requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for various conditions.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to an increase in abdominal pressures that limit the capacity to wean PEEP and maintain oxygenation. PEEP will be continued with a goal to wean to 10 today with a slow wean. The patient will also need to be monitored for FIO2 and PO2 as weaning progresses. Negative fluid balance should be maintained.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal compromise and now has an additional insult to the right kidney. Oliguria has been maintained across time. Dialysis will continue, and there is likely a need for chronic use.

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent decrease in blood pressure has been limited in the ability to move to a negative fluid balance. Septic/hypovolemic causes have been identified, and improvement may occur over time. Levophed will be weaned, and even fluid balance on CVVH should be maintained.

Other medical issues that need to be addressed include alterations in nutrition, anemia secondary to blood loss, heart failure (acute on chronic), diabetes mellitus (type I), chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension,"

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has underlying Klebsiella
   pneumonia; further cx by fluid overload from receiving multiple BP (has
   CHF) and abdominal distension.
   -Blood gas looks good this AM even with PEEP reduced to 15, and  40%
   FiO2; could continue decrease PEEP to 10, with target of getting to 5
   as tolerated to keep PO2 sats > 90%.  Improvement in consolidation
   suggests that this improvement in respiratory status is due to
   resolution of underlying infection.
   -Sputum gram stain shows gram negative rods and gram positive cocci;
   being covered with azithromycin and ceftriaxone which should cover both
   gram + and klebsiella and atypicals.  WBC plateau'd and now falling;
   continue  ceftriaxone + azithromycin (day 5 of 8 day course).
   -Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to keep at balance or just slightly
   negative as per renal recs.  No need to aggressively diurese.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine continuing to resolve,
   trended down to 3.6.  Cause of ARF likely secondary to ATN secondary to
   sustained hypoTN as well as intraparenchymal bleed.  Given chronic
   kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting of GI bleed, may
   have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led to ATN.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Continues to be
   oliguric (made 5cc /hr of urine yesterday).
   - Renal following: undergoing CVVH.  Probably may have reached new
   baseline.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   .
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Aggressive bowel regimen:   PR bisacodyl, have tried soap suds enema.
   If still failing, can try milk + molasses (brown cow)
   -Reglan for short term period (3 days)
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Continues to be intermittently febrile but has
   largely resolved.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Enterococcus is sensitive to ampicillin; can switch to this and
   continue to finish 10 day course.
   -1/4 bottles is growing GPCs is likely to be contaminant; Follow-up
   blood cultures and sensitivities.
   - Continue azithromycin + ceftriaxone for CAP/klebsiella PNA (day 5 of
   8 day course). Follow up sputum cultures.
   .
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Doesn
t seem to have an active UG bleed as HCT is stable
   and does not look like frank blood.  Likely secondary to old prior
   bleed; source unclear.
   .
   -Would continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Went up on lantus yesterday.  Sugars over past 24 hours have
   been 170-230.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes; if BM occurs today can start TF;
   if no BM may have to consider TPN.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II. He presents with an acute onset of right-sided flank pain on October 30th, which was later identified as a right perirenal bleed possibly due to a ruptured renal cyst. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for several reasons, including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications during his stay in the ICU. These include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial in etiology, with underlying Klebsiella pneumonia contributing to his respiratory distress. The patient's blood gas results show good oxygenation even with a reduced PEEP and FiO2, suggesting improvement in consolidation and resolution of the underlying infection. The plan is to continue decreasing PEEP to 10 and aim for 5 as tolerated to maintain PO2 saturation above 90%.

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has underlying Klebsiella
   pneumonia; further cx by fluid overload from receiving multiple BP (has
   CHF) and abdominal distension.
   -Required increased vent settings overnight
 O2 increased from 40-50%,
   PEEP from [**1-11**].
   -Sputum gram stain shows Klebsiella, urine enterococcus
 sensitivities
   back.  Will change antibiotics to Unasyn and Cipro.
   -Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to keep at balance or just slightly
   negative as per renal recs.  No need to aggressively diurese.
   ##Mental Status
 will attempt to wean sedation.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine continuing to resolve,
   trended down to 2.9.  Cause of ARF likely secondary to ATN secondary to
   sustained hypoTN as well as intraparenchymal bleed.  Given chronic
   kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting of GI bleed, may
   have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led to ATN.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Oliguric yesterday,
   urine output increasing today.
   - Renal following: undergoing CVVH.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Attempted lactulose enema yesterday, but CVVH did not tolerate turning
   to side.
   -decreased residuals today, will attempt more aggressive PO bowel
   regimen.
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Continues to be intermittently febrile but has
   largely resolved.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Antibiotic regimen as above.
   .
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Went up on lantus yesterday.  Sugars over past 24 hours have
   been 170-230.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes; if BM occurs today can start TF;

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with a pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**] improved), and DMII who presented with acute onset of right-sided flank pain on [**2190-10-30**]. An abdominal CT showed evidence of a right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons, including possible UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), hypoxia, and possible AMI (acute myocardial infarction).

The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which is likely multifactorial in etiology. He has underlying Klebsiella pneumonia; further exacerbation may be due to fluid overload from receiving multiple blood products (has CHF) and abdominal distension. Ventilator settings were increased overnight to maintain adequate oxygenation.

The patient's mental status is expected to be weaned off sedation. Acute/chronic renal failure is ongoing, with creatinine continuing to resolve. The cause of acute renal failure (ARF) is likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sustained hypotension as well as intraparenchymal bleed. Given the patient's chronic kidney disease, he is more susceptible to ATN. Oliguria was observed yesterday, but urine output is increasing today. Renal replacement therapy"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, and a history of chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and persistent renal failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute heart failure (systolic and diastolic) on chronic heart failure, type I diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, benign hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. It is important to continue current levels of PEEP and maintain negative pressure with CVVH. Lightening sedation may also be considered.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has both chronic and acute renal failure. Continued CVVH and improvement in urine output should be monitored.

3. Hypotension: The patient remains on pressors and the antibiotic regimen has been changed to cover for specific pathogens. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results to ensure appropriate management of these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia
   Likely multifactorial in etiology.  Has underlying Klebsiella
   pneumonia; further cx by fluid overload from receiving multiple BP (has
   CHF) and abdominal distension.
   -Required increased vent settings overnight
 O2 increased from 40-50%,
   PEEP from [**1-11**].   (pO2 dropped to 60 - 80).   Is doing well this AM
   with blood gas of 128* 38 7.38 23.  Today, try bringing down PEEP to
   5.
   -Sputum gram stain shows Klebsiella, urine enterococcus
 sensitivities
   back.  Continue Unasyn and Cipro
   -Continue CVVH, can adjust rate to keep at balance or just slightly
   negative as per renal recs.  No need to aggressively diurese.
   ##Mental Status
 will attempt to wean sedation.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine continuing to resolve,
   trended down to 2.4.  Cause of ARF likely secondary to ATN secondary to
   sustained hypoTN as well as intraparenchymal bleed.  Given chronic
   kidney disease, is more subject to ATN:  in setting of GI bleed, may
   have been hypotensive, which sustained, may have led to ATN.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Urine output continuing
   to increase:  205 ccs over 24 hrs.
   - Renal following: undergoing CVVH.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Continue to follow creatinines
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Attempted lactulose enema yesterday, but CVVH did not tolerate turning
   to side.
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen.
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Continues to be intermittently febrile but has
   largely resolved.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Antibiotic regimen as above.
   .
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Went up on lantus yesterday.  Likely because TPN has been
   initiated, sugars over past 24 hours have been 200s - 300s.  Increase
   lantus from 48 - 52.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He presents with acute onset right-sided flank pain on 10/30/2190. Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

During his stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. These include hypoxia likely due to underlying Klebsiella pneumonia, fluid overload from receiving multiple blood products, and abdominal distension. His mental status has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about acute/chronic renal failure, retroperitoneal bleed, abdominal distension, fevers/leukocytosis, concern for UGIB, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, gout, and familial end stage nephropathy (FEN).

   69 yo male with renal failure in the setting of right renal hemorrhage
   in area of previous cyst.  This retroperitoneal bleed has been
   complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure as well as persistent
   renal failure.
   1)respiratory failure
 Abdomen feels less tense and starting to stool -
   may be able to tolerate lower PEEP at this point.  Off of sedation.
   Getting Unasyn for Klebsiella in sputum - tomorrow will be last day.
   2)Renal Failure
Off CVVH - will discuss with reanl if we want to
   continue today
   3)Hypotension
Remains on pressors.  Change abx to Unasyn and cipro to
   cover Klebsiella and enteerococcus
   4)RP bleed: Hcts stable.
   Remainder of issues per ICU team.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to a retroperitoneal bleed. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%. His ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 320, indicating some improvement.

2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage. His Hct levels are decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss.

3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute systolic and diastolic heart failure on top of chronic heart failure. This could be due to the hypovolemia caused by the retroperitoneal bleed.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has type I diabetes mellitus. His glucose levels have been fluctuating between 228 and 276 mg/dL.

5. Renal Failure: The patient has both chronic renal failure (CRF) and acute renal failure (ARF). His creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening renal function. He has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can contribute to poor cardiac output and further compromise his renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   -Pulm status improving - PEEP from 15-10.  PaO2 stable in 130s.
   Continue to titrate down PEEP, although due to his abdominal girth, may
   require some level of PEEP.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - start Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS
   -  No need to aggressively diurese, pre renal.  CVVH - on hold due to
   filter clotting.
   ##Mental Status
 will attempt to wean sedation.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine 3.1 from 2.4
   yesterday.   Making some urine:  185 ccs over 24 hrs.
   - Renal following: d/w regarding restarting CVVH vs 24 hr holiday.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.
   - check reticulocyte count
   - f/u hemolysis labs (? increased lysis due to CVVH)
   - guaic stools and NG output
   - Hct 24.1 today.  Transfuse 1 unit.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Attempted lactulose enema yesterday, but CVVH did not tolerate turning
   to side.
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen
 po narcan
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Spiked temp again yesterday.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Antibiotic regimen as above.
   - f/u pan culture
   - may be reaction to CVVH, given mulitple filter clots.
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.  Had another episode this morning.  Will continue to rate
   control as needed.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Likely because TPN has been initiated, sugars over past 24 hours
   have been 200s - 300s.  Home dose Lantus 44.  - Currently getting 52
   units.
   - started on insulin drip for high sugars.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TPN. Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia and the need for appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, as indicated by a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. Blood transfusions have been given, and further evaluation of reticulocyte count is needed.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure. His recent echocardiogram showed improvement, but ongoing fluid overload and hypoxia may contribute to worsening heart failure.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has both acute and chronic renal failure. Acute renal failure may be due to sustained hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed. Chronic kidney disease is present, and renal function is being closely monitored.

5. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed, possibly secondary to cyst rupture. He has received blood transfusions to support hemodynamics and reverse INR. Daily monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.

6. Abdominal Distension: The patient has abdominal distension, likely secondary to ileus. This may be contributing to respiratory compromise and needs further evaluation and management.

7. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has had recurrent fevers and leukocytosis, suggesting an ongoing infectious process. Sources include pneumonia and urinary tract infection.

8. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had coffee-ground material suctioned from the OG tube, indicating possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to prior bleeding events.

9. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and requires rate control.

10. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II, as indicated by a recent HgA1C level of 8.5%. Insulin therapy is being initiated to manage blood glucose levels.

11. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and is receiving levothyroxine sodium supplementation.

12. Gout: The patient has gout and is being treated with allopurinol due to poor glomerular filtration rate.

   -decreased the PEEP from 15 -> 12:  repeat ABG was 7.39, 36, 132.
   Decreased again to 10.
   saturating well; can consider going down on PEEP tomorrow AM
   -CVVH temporarily stopped this morning due to clotting of filter;
   filter changed. while CVVH stopped, fever unmasked ~101.  Pan-cultured
   again.  CVVH restarted, and stopped again due to fiter clotting.
   -CVVH recalculated for net balance of 0 taken off (doesnt seem to be
   very volume overloaded)
   -lantus increased from 48 -> 52, but sugars still high in the 300s;
   started on insulin drip; talk to nutrition tomorrow AM since should be
   getting adequate insulin in TPN.  also will need to talk to them about

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   -Pulm status improving - PEEP from 15-10.  PaO2 stable in 130s.
   Continue to titrate down PEEP, although due to his abdominal girth, may
   require some level of PEEP.
   -Sputum gram stain shows Klebsiella, Urine enterococcus
 sensitivities
   back.  Continue Unasyn and Cipro (Double coverage for Klebsiella)
   -  No need to aggressively diurese, pre renal.  CVVH - on hold due to
   filter clotting.
   ##Mental Status
 will attempt to wean sedation.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine 3.1 from 2.4
   yesterday.   Making some urine:  185 ccs over 24 hrs.
   - Renal following: d/w regarding restarting CVVH vs 24 hr holiday.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.
   - check reticulocyte count
   - f/u hemolysis labs (? increased lysis due to CVVH)
   - guaic stools and NG output
   - Hct 24.1 today.  Transfuse 1 unit.
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Attempted lactulose enema yesterday, but CVVH did not tolerate turning
   to side.
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen.
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis - Spiked temp again yesterday.
   -Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Antibiotic regimen as above.
   - f/u pan culture
   - may be reaction to CVVH, given mulitple filter clots.
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - currently on metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hrs: rate controlled with HRs <
   100
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Likely because TPN has been initiated, sugars over past 24 hours
   have been 200s - 300s.  Home dose Lantus 44.  - Currently getting 52
   units.
   - started on insulin drip for high sugars.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TPN. Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with acute onset right-sided flank pain on [2190-10-30], and an abdominal CT showed evidence of a right perirenal bleed, possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is improving, with PEEP decreased from 15 to 10. The PaO2 is stable in the 130s. It is recommended to continue titrating down PEEP, although due to his abdominal girth, some level of PEEP may be required. Sputum gram stain shows Klebsiella, and urine culture results are pending. The patient will continue to receive Unasyn and Cipro (double coverage for Klebsiella). Aggressive diuresis is not needed, as the patient has pre-renal azotemia. CVVH is on hold due to filter clotting.
2. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is expected to improve as sedation is weaned.
3. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. The healthcare team is closely monitoring the patient's oxygen levels and adjusting the ventilator settings as needed.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his condition may worsen due to the ongoing RP bleed and sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy (e.g., CVVH) may be necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, suggesting ongoing hypotension. This may be due to sepsis, and further evaluation and management are required.

4. RP Bleed: The patient has a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed, which can cause anemia and hypotension. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) has been initiated, and ongoing monitoring is essential.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   -Pulm status improving -  Attempted RISBI, tolerated, but tachypneic.
   Continue to titrate down PEEP, although due to his abdominal girth, may
   require some level of PEEP.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - start Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus also
   -  No need to aggressively diurese, pre renal.  Continue CVVH
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Continues to have low grade tmeperatures
   - Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Antibiotic regimen as above.
   - repeat pan culture
   - may be reaction to CVVH, given mulitple filter clots.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.  Had another episode this morning.  Will continue to rate
   control as needed.   Had episode in setting of hypertension to 200s
   during period of extubation.  Continues to flip in an out of this
   morphology on tele.
   - cycle enzymes.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##Mental Status
 will attempt to wean sedation.
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Attempted lactulose enema yesterday, but CVVH did not tolerate turning
   to side.
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen
 po narcan
   - reduced NG output
   - nutrition rec low volume elemental diet to start today
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine 2.7 from 3.3
   yesterday.   Making some urine:  470ccs over 24 hrs.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  Rets appropriately.
   No evidence of hemolysis.
   - Transufsed one unit yesterday, Hct stable this mornign
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Likely because TPN has been initiated, sugars over past 24 hours
   have been 200s - 300s.  Home dose Lantus 44.
   - started on insulin drip for high sugars.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TPN. Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for possible ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) based on the bilateral pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray.

2. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage and retroperitoneal bleed. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and there is concern for acute exacerbation due to fluid overload, Klebsiella pneumonia, and abdominal distension.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with an acute on chronic presentation. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sustained hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed. Additionally, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised renal function.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator on coumadin. The recent episodes of tachycardia and chest discomfort suggest ongoing arrhythmias.

6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control as evidenced by HgA1C of 8.5%. The initiation of TPN has resulted in high blood sugars in the past 24 hours.

7. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has evidence of intraparenchymal/subcapsular bleed of the right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in the setting of high INR from coumadin.

8. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has evidence of ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleed with coffee-ground material suctioned from the OG tube.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise for the patient based on the provided progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   -Pulm status improving -  Attempted RISBI, tolerated, but tachypneic.
   Continue to titrate down PEEP, although due to his abdominal girth, may
   require some level of PEEP.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - start Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus also
   -  No need to aggressively diurese, pre renal.  Continue dialysis
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Continues to have low grade tmeperatures
   - Sources including CAP, UTI as urine is growing enterococcus.
   Antibiotic regimen as above.
   - repeat pan culture
   - may be reaction to CVVH, given mulitple filter clots.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.  Had another episode this morning.  Will continue to rate
   control as needed.   Had episode in setting of hypertension to 200s
   during period of extubation.  Continues to flip in an out of this
   morphology on tele.
   - cycle enzymes.
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##Mental Status
 will attempt to wean sedation.
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Attempted lactulose enema yesterday, but CVVH did not tolerate turning
   to side.
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen
 po narcan
   - reduced NG output
   - nutrition rec low volume elemental diet to start today
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine 2.7 from 3.3
   yesterday.   Making some urine:  470ccs over 24 hrs.
   - d/w renal starting HD instead of CVVH.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  Rets appropriately.
   No evidence of hemolysis.
   - Transufsed one unit yesterday, Hct stable this mornign
   - daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Likely because TPN has been initiated, sugars over past 24 hours
   have been 200s - 300s.  Home dose Lantus 44.
   - started on insulin drip for high sugars.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: Start TF per nutrition, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as
   necessary.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, IV PPI
   # Access: d/c L IJ, attempt placement of peripherals,  continue HD line
 d/w Renal placement of non tunneled HD line

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple acute and chronic conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to bilateral pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and adjustments to the ventilator settings may be necessary.

2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage. The low hematocrit levels indicate a need for blood transfusion to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure. This condition may worsen due to fluid overload and the patient's renal dysfunction.

4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which is poorly controlled with a recent HgA1C level of 8.5%. Insulin therapy is required to manage the patient's high blood sugar levels, especially with the initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

5. Renal Failure: The patient has both acute renal failure (possibly acute tubular necrosis) and chronic renal failure. The creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. Dialysis may be necessary to manage the patient's renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.

6. Retroperitoneal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of intraparenchymal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type I, obstructive sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to a retroperitoneal bleed, persistent renal failure, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including heart failure (systolic and diastolic), anemia secondary to blood loss, and type I diabetes mellitus. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to the hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by the retroperitoneal bleed. It is important to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Fevers: The patient has left internal jugular (IJ) line site that appears erythematous. This could indicate an infection or inflammation. The line should be pulled, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is ongoing renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which needs to be addressed promptly. Vasopressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

5. Retroperitoneal Bleed (RP Bleed): The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed, which can"

   defibrillator leads are in standard positions. A right jugular central

   and a left jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein. There is
   improvement in aeration of the left lower lobe, small pleural effusions
   remain present. There is no pneumothorax.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia:
   Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - start Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus also (day 3)
   - Continues to be mildly hypervolemic on exam.  Yesterday attempted to
   continue CVVH, but not tolerating as SBP dropped and required pressor
   support. Was +2 L positive yesterday, over length of stay is +1 L
   positive.  Today is currently hypertensive and off pressors; can
   attempt to make -1 L negative again today using CVVH.
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  became tachycardic upon switch and
   mildly hypervolemic and mental-status wise awake but periodically
   agitated; otherwise, pneumonia seems to have improved per CXR,
   abdominal distension improved.  To address these barriers and wean,
   will need to improve hypervolemia with CVVH as discussed.  Today can
   try to bring PEEP down from 10 to 8; cautious secondary to abdominal
   distension.  Attempt CVVH; if tolerating fluid coming off, then this
   evening can attempt to switch to PSV.  If becomes tachycardic, give IV
   metoprolol and try to maintain PSV.  For agitation, can try giving
   one-time doses of benzos to try to come down on sedation.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.  Had another episode this morning.  Will continue to rate
   control as needed.  Couple days ago had episode in setting of
   hypertension to 200s during period of extubation.  Continues to flip in
   an out of this morphology on tele.
   - Cardiac enzymes stable
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen
 po narcan
   - reduced NG output
   - nutrition rec low volume elemental diet started yesterday
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine continuing
   to trend down, now 2.5.   Again made 470ccs over 24 hrs (20 ccs/hr)
   - Continue CVVH as above
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Touch base w/ renal re: HD vs CVVH
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  Rets appropriately.
   No evidence of hemolysis.
   -HCTs continue to be stable
   -daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Improved, has been afebrile and WBC has
   trended down.  F/u catheter tip cxs, sputum cxs, bcxs.
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; can stop insulin drip and
   re-start on home lantus today of 44 and cover with HISS; adjust doses
   as necessary.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: Start TF per nutrition, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as
   necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, systolic CHF, and DMII. He presented with acute onset right-sided flank pain and was found to have evidence of a right perirenal bleed, possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons, including possible UGIB, hypoxia, and possible AMI.

The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumonia and enterococcus UTI. He has been treated with ciprofloxacin and ampicillin/sulbactam, and vancomycin has been started empirically for gram-positive cocci on sputum gram stain.

The patient continues to be mildly hypervolemic and has been unable to tolerate CVVH due to hypotension requiring pressor support. His blood pressure is currently hypertensive and off pressors. An attempt will be made today to make him 1 L negative using CVVH. Barriers to weaning from mechanical ventilation include mild hypervolemia, mental status changes, and periodic agitation. The plan is to improve hypervolemia with CVVH, bring PEEP down from 10 to 8, and attempt to switch to PSV if tolerating fluid coming off. Metoprolol will be given IV if the patient becomes tachycardic during PSV.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid vent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of renal failure, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed), which has been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and persistent renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There may be a need to adjust ventilator settings or consider tracheostomy if extubation is not possible due to mental status.
2. Fevers: The patient had fevers, which were initially attributed to an infection. Further investigation and management are required.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his renal function needs to be closely monitored. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been restarted.
4. Hypotension: The patient required pressor support but is now off neosynephrine. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.
5. RP Bleed: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed, which needs ongoing assessment and management.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and amiodarone has been continued with occasional Lopressor administration.

Other Issues:

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from
   receiving multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - start Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus also (day 4)
   - Continues to be mildly hypervolemic on exam.  On CVVH, net negative
   yesterday, goal today negative
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  became tachycardic upon switch and
   mildly hypervolemic and mental-status wise awake but periodically
   agitated; otherwise, pneumonia seems to have improved per CXR,
   abdominal distension improved.  To address these barriers and wean,
   will need to improve hypervolemia with CVVH as discussed.  Did not
   tolerate decrease in PEEP to 8.  yesterday, continue to try to wean and
   attempt switch to PSV
   If becomes tachycardic, give IV metoprolol and try to maintain PSV.
   For agitation, can try giving one-time doses of benzos to try to come
   down on sedation.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.  Will continue to rate control as needed.  Couple days ago had
   episode in setting of hypertension to 200s during period of
   extubation.  Continues to flip in an out of this morphology on tele.
   12.5 mg metoprolol added TID with improved pressures (130-140/60 and HR
   in low 90s).  Also require some IV metoprolol when HR elevated.
   - Cardiac enzymes stable
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen
 po narcan
   - reduced NG output
   - nutrition rec low volume elemental diet started yesterday
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Again made 335cc over 24 hrs (20 ccs/hr)
   - Continue CVVH as above
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Touch base w/ renal re: HD vs CVVH
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  Rets appropriately.
   No evidence of hemolysis.
   -HCTs continue to be stable
   -daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Febrilex1 overnight and WBC has trended down.
   -  F/u catheter tip cxs, sputum cxs, bcxs, repeated.
   - Vanc after HD, will start cefepime for concern of VAP vs line
   infection
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; can stop insulin drip and
   re-start on home lantus today of 44 and cover with HISS; adjust doses
   as necessary.
   - on Lantus and SSI
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: Start TF per nutrition, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as
   necessary.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, IV PPI

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: Klebsiella pneumonia; fluid overload from
   receiving multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - start Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus also (day 4)
   - Continues to be mildly hypervolemic on exam.  On CVVH, net negative
   yesterday, goal today....
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  became tachycardic upon switch and
   mildly hypervolemic and mental-status wise awake but periodically
   agitated; otherwise, pneumonia seems to have improved per CXR,
   abdominal distension improved.  To address these barriers and wean,
   will need to improve hypervolemia with CVVH as discussed.  Did not
   tolerate decrease in PEEP to 8.  yesterday, continue to try to wean and
   attempt switch to PSV
   If becomes tachycardic, give IV metoprolol and try to maintain PSV.
   For agitation, can try giving one-time doses of benzos to try to come
   down on sedation.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s becoming symptomatic with chest discomfort and
   dyspnea.  Will continue to rate control as needed.  Couple days ago had
   episode in setting of hypertension to 200s during period of
   extubation.  Continues to flip in an out of this morphology on tele.
   12.5 mg metoprolol added TID with improved pressures (130-140/60 and HR
   in low 90s).  Also require some IV metoprolol when HR elevated.
   - Cardiac enzymes stable
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   -Continuing aggressive PO bowel regimen
 po narcan
   - reduced NG output
   - nutrition rec low volume elemental diet started yesterday
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Again made 335cc over 24 hrs (20 ccs/hr)
   - Continue CVVH as above
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   -Touch base w/ renal re: HD vs CVVH
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  Rets appropriately.
   No evidence of hemolysis.
   -HCTs continue to be stable
   -daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 25 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Febrilex1 overnight and WBC has trended down.
   -  F/u catheter tip cxs, sputum cxs, bcxs, repeated.
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; can stop insulin drip and
   re-start on home lantus today of 44 and cover with HISS; adjust doses
   as necessary.
   - on Lantus and SSI
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: Start TF per nutrition, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as
   necessary.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient presented with acute onset right-sided flank pain on [**2190-10-30**], and an abdominal CT showed evidence of a right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxia: Multifactorial, including Klebsiella pneumonia, fluid overload from receiving multiple blood products (has CHF), and abdominal distension.
- Treatment for Klebsiella pneumonia and enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) is complete.
- Start Vancomycin empirically for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) on sputum Gram stain, should cover for enterococcus also (day 4).
- Continue to be mildly hypervolemic on exam. On continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), net negative yesterday, goal today.
- Barriers to weaning to pressure support ventilation (PSV): became tachycardic upon switch and mildly hypervole"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of renal failure, type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and a retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient has been febrile overnight and is agitated, with increased sedation required. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal a retroperitoneal bleed in the area of a previous cyst.

The patient's medical complications include delirium, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and obstructive sleep apnea.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1) Respiratory failure: Continue current vent management, ongoing fluid removal, and hemodialysis today.
2) Fevers: Ongoing fevers, reculture overnight. Will continue vancomycin and reinstitute gram-negative coverage.
3) Renal failure: Hemodialysis today.
4) Hypotension: Pressors off currently.
5) RP bleed: Hct stable.

 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible [**Date Range **].
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: ?VAP; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 5)
   - Continues goal negative fluid valance with CVVH
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  Becomes agitated on lower levels of
   sedation.  Reduce sedation, continue to remove fluid.  Continue to
   wean.
   - For agitation, can try giving one-time doses of benzos to try to come
   down on sedation.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   -  12.5 mg metoprolol added TID, uptitrate as needed
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   - po narcan to maintain stool output
   - reduced NG output
   - tolerating TF
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Again made 335cc over 24 hrs (20 ccs/hr)
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   - getting  HD
   - hopefully d/c pressors to continue HD
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  No evidence of
   hemolysis.
   -HCTs continue to be stable
   -daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 21 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Afebrile  WBC has trended down.
   -  F/u catheter tip cxs, sputum cxs, bcxs, repeated.
   - Vanc for line infection, Cefepime for broader coverage of VAP.
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; can stop insulin drip and
   re-start on home lantus today of 44 and cover with HISS; adjust doses
   as necessary.
   - on Lantus and SSI

The patient has multiple comorbidities including CHF, DM, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. He also has acute-on-chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, and anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with delirium/confusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and complications related to his diabetes management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status, renal function, electrolyte balance, and respiratory status. Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status and nutritional needs is also crucial."

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: ?VAP; fluid overload from receiving
   multiple BP (has CHF); abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 5)
   - Continues goal negative fluid valance with CVVH
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  Becomes agitated on lower levels of
   sedation.  Reduce sedation, continue to remove fluid.  Continue to
   wean.
   - For agitation, can try giving one-time doses of benzos to try to come
   down on sedation.
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   -  12.5 mg metoprolol added TID, uptitrate as needed
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Abdominal distension
 likely secondary to ileus: KUB shows lots of
   air + stool in bowel:
   - po narcan to maintain stool output
   - reduced NG output
   - tolerating TF
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Again made 335cc over 24 hrs (20 ccs/hr)
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   - getting  HD
   - hopefully d/c pressors to continue HD
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  No evidence of
   hemolysis.
   -HCTs continue to be stable
   -daily HCTs.  PRBC transfusion for goal > 21 and FFP transfusion for
   INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   ## Fevers/leukocytosis -  Afebrile  WBC has trended down.
   -  F/u catheter tip cxs, sputum cxs, bcxs, repeated.
   - Vanc for line infection, Cefepime for broader coverage of VAP.
   ## Concern for UGIB:  Multiple times coffee-ground material suctioned
   from OG tube.  Hematocrit stable.  Likely secondary to old prior bleed;
   source unclear.   [**Name2 (NI) 133**] continue to follow HCT.
   -Will continue IV PPI
   -maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; can stop insulin drip and
   re-start on home lantus today of 44 and cover with HISS; adjust doses
   as necessary.
   - on Lantus and SSI
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, systolic CHF, and DMII. He presented with acute onset right-sided flank pain and was found to have a right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia, and possible AMI.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is sedated and intubated, which can contribute to confusion and delirium. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status regularly and provide appropriate interventions to prevent or manage this condition.

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.

3. Anemia, Acute, Secondary to Blood Loss (Hemorrhage, Bleeding): The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma to support hemodynamics and reverse INR. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and ensuring adequate oxygen delivery is crucial.

4. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic and Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient has a history of systolic CHF, and there is concern for acute exacerbation due to fluid overload."

 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   69 yo male with renal failure in the setting of right renal hemorrhage
   in area of previous cyst.  This retroperitoneal bleed has been
   complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure as well as persistent
   renal failure.
   1)respiratory failure
 Has persistent secretions.  Now on vanc plus
   cefepime.  Recheck sputum culture.
   2)Fevers: Ongoing fevers.  Reculture again.  Antibiotics as above.
   Consider abd imaging if he continues to spike.
   3)Renal Failure
 Next HD per renal
   4)Hypotension
 BP very labile depending on sedation and level of
   agitation
   5)RP bleed: Hct continues to drift down - transfuse 1 unit today
   6)Afib: Amio.  prn Lopressor.
   7)Delerium/Agitation: Will institute Zyprexa
   Given ongoing labile blood pressures, persistent secretions, volume
   overload - will discuss tracheostomy with family.
   Remainder of issues per ICU team.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, and a history of retroperitoneal bleed. He is currently in the ICU due to acute renal failure and a right renal hemorrhage. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. He has ongoing fevers, hypotension, and delirium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 144/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent secretions and is on antibiotics, but it is important to recheck sputum culture. Continued hypoxemia may require consideration of tracheostomy.
2. Fevers: Ongoing fevers may indicate an ongoing infection. Reculture should be done, and antibiotics should be continued. If symptoms persist, abdominal imaging should be considered.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is persistent, and next hemodialysis (HD) per renal should be scheduled.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and depends on sedation and level of agitation. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

   negative
   [**11-4**]: sputum
   3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: ?VAP; fluid overload (EF 35%) is overall +1
   L w/ evidence for congestion on CXR; abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 6); added cefepime 2 days ago for
   empiric coverage of VAP (on day 3)
   - Continues goal negative fluid balance with HD
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  Sedation and pulmonary edema.  Becomes
   agitated on lower levels of sedation.  Was started on olanzapine [**Hospital1 7**] so
   will allow some room to reduce sedation further; continue to remove
   fluid w/ HD w goal of -500 to 1 L negative.
   ## Fevers
   -Added cefepime to vanc for empiric coverage of gram + and gram -.  No
   known source.  Repeat cxs continue to be negative.
   -Obtain AST/ALT, alk phos, tbili (don't have any since [**11-2**])
   -Does have diarrhea: repeat C diff, stool studies, stool culture
   -if LFT abnormalities noted: obtain RUQ US, consider CT of abdomen
   -assess skin for ulcers, cellulitis
   -f/u cultures
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   -  12.5 mg metoprolol added TID, uptitrate as needed
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   .
   ## Diarrhea:  Likely secondary to resolving ileus; should also consider
   c-difficile associated disease, viral/bacterial gastroenteritis given
   persistent fevers
   -obtain stool studies, repeat c-diff
   -d/c lactulose
   -f/u cultures
   .
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Only making 10 - 20 cc/hr.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   - Reduce sedation as this keeps dropping his BP and further compromises
   perfusion to kidneys; keep SBP > 100
   - continue HD
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  No evidence of
   hemolysis.
   -HCTs slowly trending down: 25 -> 23 -> 21.
   -Check HCT this PM, if < 21 can tranfuse.  PRBC transfusion for goal >
   21 and FFP transfusion for INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   -Continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; on lantus 50 at PM and covering
   with SS.
   - Sugars 100 - 200; continue lantus + SS.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TF, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, systolic CHF, and DMII.
- He presented with acute onset right-sided flank pain and was found to have evidence of a right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst.
- The patient has been in the ICU for various reasons, including possible UGIB, hypoxia, and possible AMI.
- Current issues include hypoxia, fevers, atrial fibrillation with RVR, diarrhea, acute/chronic renal failure, retroperitoneal bleed, and DMII.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing multifactorial hypoxia, possibly due to VAP, fluid overload, and abdominal distension. Treatment includes addressing the underlying causes and maintaining a negative fluid balance with HD.
2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers despite negative repeat CXRs. Empiric coverage has been added for gram+ and gram- infections, and further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has irregular wide complex tachycardia up to 140 bpm, previously symptomatic. Rate control is being maintained with metoprolol and further evaluation by an EP specialist is planned.
4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, likely secondary to resolving ileus. It should also be considered as possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: ?VAP; fluid overload (EF 35%) is overall +1
   L w/ evidence for congestion on CXR; abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 6); added cefepime 2 days ago for
   empiric coverage of VAP (on day 3)
   - Attempt to take off 2 L today w/ ultrafiltration
   - Barriers to weaning to PSV:  Sedation and pulmonary edema.  Becomes
   agitated on lower levels of sedation.  Was started on olanzapine [**Hospital1 7**] so
   will allow some room to reduce sedation further; continue to remove
   fluid w/ UF w goal of -2  L negative.
   ## Fevers
   -Added cefepime to vanc for empiric coverage of gram + and gram -.  No
   known source.  Repeat cxs continue to be negative.
   -Obtain AST/ALT, alk phos, tbili (don't have any since [**11-2**])
   -Does have diarrhea: repeat C diff, stool studies, stool culture
   -if LFT abnormalities noted: obtain RUQ US, consider CT of abdomen
   -assess skin for ulcers, cellulitis
   -f/u cultures
   .
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   -  12.5 mg metoprolol added TID, uptitrate as needed
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   .
   ## Diarrhea:  Likely secondary to resolving ileus; should also consider
   c-difficile associated disease, viral/bacterial gastroenteritis given
   persistent fevers
   -obtain stool studies, repeat c-diff
   -d/c lactulose
   -f/u cultures
   .
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Only making 10 - 20 cc/hr.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   - Reduce sedation as this keeps dropping his BP and further compromises
   perfusion to kidneys; keep SBP > 100
   - continue UF
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  No evidence of
   hemolysis.
   -HCTs slowly trending down: 25 -> 23 -> 21.
   -Check HCT this PM, if < 21 can tranfuse.  PRBC transfusion for goal >
   21 and FFP transfusion for INR goal < 1.9
   -holding ASA and coumadin
   -Continue IV PPI
   -Maintain active type and screen

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**] improved), and DMII. The patient presented with acute onset of right-sided flank pain on [**2190-10-30**]. An abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst. The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia, and possible AMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing multifactorial hypoxia, possibly due to VAP, fluid overload (EF 35%), and abdominal distension.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute/chronic renal failure, possibly due to sustained hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chronic kidney disease. The rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised renal function.
3. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, likely secondary to resolving ileus. It should also be considered as a possible Clostridium difficile infection or viral/bacterial gastroenteritis given the persistent fevers.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has an irregular wide complex tachycardia up to 140 beats per minute, previously symptomatic. Rate control needs to be continued as needed.
5. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has an intraparenchymal / subcapsular bleed of the right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in the setting of high INR from coumadin. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma to support hemodynamics and reverse INR.
6. Gout: The patient is taking allopurinol 100 mg every other day due to poor GFR (renally dosed).
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is taking levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg.
8. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's most recent HgA1C level was 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**] [**2190**]. Enteral nutrition has been re-initiated, and the patient is on lantus 50 at PM and covering with SS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II.
- He presented with acute onset right-sided flank pain on [**2190-10-30**], and an abdominal CT showed evidence of a right perirenal bleed possibly from a renal cyst.
- The patient was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons, including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
- His current conditions include delirium/confusion, alteration in nutrition, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), anemia acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage), heart failure (systolic and diastolic) acute on chronic, diabetes mellitus type I, chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension benign, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) spontaneous.
- The patient has been treated with antibiotics for klebsiella pneumonia and enterococcus urinary tract infection, ultrafiltration, lasix trial, and olanzapine to reduce sedation without causing further hypotension.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm (68-89 bpm), blood pressure of 114/51 mmHg (71-167/43-73 mmHg), respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (18-31 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 97%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210.
- Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 (10.1-7.2 x 103/mm3), hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL (8.4-7.9 g/dL), platelet count of 211 K/uL (156-203 K/uL), creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL (2.8-4.6 mg/dL), blood glucose of 40 mg/dL, and other abnormal lab values.

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2188**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2190-10-30**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: ?VAP; fluid overload (EF 35%) is overall +1
   L w/ evidence for congestion on CXR; abdominal distension.
   - treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 7); added cefepime for empiric
   coverage of VAP (on day 4)
   - continue ultrafiltration
   - Barriers to weaning PSV:  Sedation and pulmonary edema.  Was started
   on olanzapine [**Hospital1 7**] so will allow some room to reduce sedation without
   causing further hypotension; continue to remove fluid w/ UF w goal of
   -2  L negative.
   ## Fevers
   -Added cefepime to vanc for empiric coverage of gram + and gram -.  No
   known source.  Repeat cxs continue to be negative.
   -C diff, stool studies, stool culture, urine and sputum negative
   -f/u cultures
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - 12.5 mg metoprolol tid
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Diarrhea:  Likely secondary to resolving ileus; should also consider
   c-difficile associated disease, viral/bacterial gastroenteritis given
   persistent fevers
   -obtain stool studies, repeat c-diff
   -d/c lactulose
   -f/u cultures
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function; may have reached new baseline.  Creatinine stable, now
   2.7.   Only making 10 - 20 cc/hr.
   - Renally dosing meds, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   - Reduce sedation as this keeps dropping his BP and further compromises
   perfusion to kidneys; keep SBP > 100
   - continue UF
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  HCTs are currently stable. Patient is now s/p
   4 units PRBC
s and 7 units FFP to help support hemodynamics and reverse
   INR.   Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination of slow blood loss
   and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.  No evidence of
   hemolysis.
   -HCTs slowly trending down: 25 -> 23 -> 21.
   -Check HCT this PM, if < 21 can tranfuse.  PRBC transfusion for goal >
   21 and FFP transfusion for INR goal < 1.9

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF and DMII with right
   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred
   to ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and
   possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Primarily fluid overload given pulmonary congestion on CXR,
   however is overall net negative for LOS, concern for cardiac etiology.
   Last ECHO [**10-31**] with EF 35%.  S/p treatment for klebsiella PNA and
   enterococcus UTI complete, Abx di
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 8); added cefepime for empiric
   coverage of VAP (on day 5)
   - continue ultrafiltration
   - Barriers to weaning PSV:  Sedation and pulmonary edema.  Was started
   on olanzapine [**Hospital1 7**] so will allow some room to reduce sedation without
   causing further hypotension; continue to remove fluid w/ UF w goal of
   -2  L negative.
   - ECHO to assess CHF as contributing to volume overload
   ## Fevers: Afebrile x3d (last fever [**11-12**]), WBC stable.
   -Added cefepime to vanc for empiric coverage of gram + and gram -.  No
   known source.  Repeat cxs continue to be negative.
   -C diff, stool studies, stool culture, urine and sputum negative
   -f/u cultures
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.  Creatinine increasing, now 5.1, making better urine
   (66cc/hr).  On lasix gtt.
   - Reduce sedation as this keeps dropping his BP and further compromises
   perfusion to kidneys; keep SBP > 100
   - continue UF
   - touch base tomorrow with renal re: continuing HD
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - 12.5 mg metoprolol tid
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct trending down.  S/p
   transfusion [**11-13**] with bump, now Hct 27.5, stable.  No evidence
   hemolysis.  Likely combination of slow blood loss and reduced retic
   from renal disease.
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - guiac stool
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse if hct <21
   ## Diarrhea:  Likely secondary to resolving ileus; c. dif negative.
   Now no BM x2d.
   -f/u cultures
   -restart lactulose
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination
   of slow blood loss and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.
   No evidence of hemolysis.  Given 1U PRBC [**11-13**], now stable at 27.5.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). The patient was admitted to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia primarily due to fluid overload with pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray. There is also a concern for cardiac etiology, as the patient's last echocardiogram (ECHO) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The patient has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia and enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI), and is currently on vancomycin empirically for gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in the sputum gram stain, as well as line infection. Cefepime has been added for empirical coverage of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient is being ultrafiltrated to remove excess fluid and reduce volume overload. Sedation barriers to weaning pressure support ventilation (PSV) include sedation and pulmonary edema. Olanzapine has been started to allow some room to reduce sedation without causing further hypotension.

The patient is febrile-free for three days,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a medical history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF, and DMII. He was admitted to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia, and possible AMI. The patient has several ongoing medical complications including hypoxia, fevers, acute/chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, anemia, diarrhea, and retroperitoneal bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing multifactorial hypoxia, which includes possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and fluid overload. The CXR shows evidence of congestion, and the patient has abdominal distension.
2. Fevers: The patient had fevers in the past, but currently, he is afebrile for three days. There is no known source of infection, and repeat cultures have been negative.
3. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function, likely due to sustained hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chronic kidney disease. His creatinine level is increasing, and he is showing signs of fluid overload.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has irregular wide complex tachycardia up to 140 bpm, previously symptomatic. Rate control measures are being taken.
5. Anemia: The patient had a retroperitoneal bleed resulting in anemia, but his Hct has stabilized after a transfusion. Slow blood loss and reduced reticulocyte count due to renal disease are contributing factors.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely secondary to resolving ileus, and Clostridium difficile has been ruled out.
7. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has an intraparenchymal/subcapsular bleed of the right kidney, possibly due to cyst rupture in the setting of high INR from coumadin. The patient received a blood transfusion and is now stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF and DMII with right
   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred
   to ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and
   possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Multifactorial: ?VAP; fluid overload (EF 35% 10/4) is
   overall net negative for LOS, however w/ evidence for congestion on
   CXR; abdominal distension.  S/p treatment for klebsiella PNA and
   enterococcus UTI complete
   - on Vancomycin empirically for GPCs on sputum GS , should cover for
   enterococcus, and line infection (day 8); added cefepime for empiric
   coverage of VAP (on day 5)
   - continue ultrafiltration
   - Barriers to weaning PSV:  Sedation and pulmonary edema.  Was started
   on olanzapine [**Hospital1 7**] so will allow some room to reduce sedation without
   causing further hypotension; continue to remove fluid w/ UF w goal of
   -2  L negative.
   - ECHO to assess CHF as contributing to volume overload
   ## Fevers: Afebrile x3d (last fever [**11-12**]), WBC stable.
   -Added cefepime to vanc for empiric coverage of gram + and gram -.  No
   known source.  Repeat cxs continue to be negative.
   -C diff, stool studies, stool culture, urine and sputum negative
   -f/u cultures
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.  Creatinine increasing, now 5.1, making better urine
   (66cc/hr).  On lasix gtt.
   - Reduce sedation as this keeps dropping his BP and further compromises
   perfusion to kidneys; keep SBP > 100
   - continue UF
   - touch base tomorrow with renal re: continuing HD
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - 12.5 mg metoprolol tid
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct trending down.  S/p
   transfusion [**11-13**] with bump, now Hct 27.5, stable.  No evidence
   hemolysis.  Likely combination of slow blood loss and reduced retic
   from renal disease.
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - guiac stool
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse if hct <21
   ## Diarrhea:  Likely secondary to resolving ileus; c. dif negative.
   Now no BM x2d.
   -f/u cultures
   -restart lactulose
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination
   of slow blood loss and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.
   No evidence of hemolysis.  Given 1U PRBC [**11-13**], now stable at 27.5.
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; on lantus 50 at PM and covering
   with SS.
   - Sugars 100 - 200; continue lantus + SS.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TF, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator on Coumadin, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was admitted to the ICU for multiple reasons, including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. His weight is currently 117.9 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and lactate levels. His creatinine level is significantly elevated at 5.1 mg/dL, indicating acute/chronic renal failure. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium. The patient has an increased lactic acid level and low albumin level.

Imaging studies reveal evidence of fluid overload and congestion on chest X-ray. The patient has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia and enterococcus urinary tract infection. He has been given vancomycin empirically for gram-positive cocci"

   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred
   to ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and
   possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Primarily fluid overload given pulmonary congestion on CXR,
   however is overall net negative for LOS, concern for cardiac etiology.
   Last ECHO [**10-31**] with EF 35%.  S/p treatment for klebsiella PNA and
   enterococcus UTI complete, Abx stopped yesterday (vanc and ceepime)
   - ECHO to assess CHF as contributing to volume overload
   - continue ultrafiltration with goal -2L
   - continue olanzapine PRN as to avoid further sedatives which have been
   making weaning difficult
   - Spontaneous breathing trial
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.  Creatinine increasing, now 5.1, making better urine
   (66cc/hr).  On lasix gtt.
   - Reduce sedation as this keeps dropping his BP and further compromises
   perfusion to kidneys; keep SBP > 100
   - continue UF
   - touch base tomorrow with renal re: continuing HD
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - 25mg metoprolol tid, after ECHO consider optimizing BP meds
   - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct trending down.  S/p
   transfusion [**11-13**] with bump, now Hct 27.5, stable.  No evidence
   hemolysis.  Likely combination of slow blood loss and reduced retic
   from renal disease.
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - guiac stool
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse if hct <21
   ## Fevers: Afebrile x3d (last fever [**11-12**]), WBC stable.
   -Added cefepime to vanc for empiric coverage of gram + and gram -.  No
   known source.  Repeat cxs continue to be negative.
   -C diff, stool studies, stool culture, urine and sputum negative
   -f/u cultures
   ## Diarrhea:  Likely secondary to resolving ileus; c. dif negative.
   Now no BM x2d.
   -f/u cultures
   -restart lactulose
   ## Retroperitoneal Bleed: patient with intraparrenchymal / subcapsular
   bleed of right kidney possibly secondary to cyst rupture in setting of
   high INR from coumadin.  Hct tredning down slowly likely a combination
   of slow blood loss and reduced reticulyte count given renal disease.
   No evidence of hemolysis.  Given 1U PRBC [**11-13**], now stable at 27.5.
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; on lantus 75 at PM and covering
   with SS.  Elevated sugars.
   - Continue lantus + SS.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TF, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, IV PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF, and DMII. He has been admitted to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia, and possible AMI. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxia, acute/chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, anemia, fevers, diarrhea, and retroperitoneal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is primarily due to fluid overload, as indicated by pulmonary congestion on CXR. However, there is a concern for cardiac etiology, especially considering the patient's history of systolic CHF and last ECHO showing an EF of 35%. Further assessment of CHF contributing to volume overload is recommended.

2. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure (ATN) from sustained hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chronic kidney disease. There is also a possibility of further compromised renal function due to the rupture of a renal cyst. Creatinine levels are increasing, and urine output is improving with the use of lasix.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has irregular wide complex tachycardia up to 140, previously symptomatic. Rate control is being maintained"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing respiratory failure, renal failure (both acute and chronic), anemia secondary to blood loss, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), diabetes mellitus type I, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's current condition is stable, with no acute distress and symmetric breath sounds. They are alert and responsive, following simple commands. However, they have distended abdomen and lower extremity edema is absent. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 150/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 520 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and respiratory system brushing should be implemented"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic renal failure, type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, and a history of retroperitoneal bleed. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and persistent renal failure.

The patient's recent progress includes improvement in respiratory function while on pressure support ventilation (PSV), tolerating well, and showing no acute distress. Fevers have been trending down. Efforts to diurese with Lasix have been made to manage renal failure, but creatinine levels are increasing. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, indicating that the retroperitoneal bleed is not worsening. Atrial fibrillation has been managed with amiodarone and as-needed Lopressor.

The patient's medical complications and conditions include delirium/confusion, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute on chronic, diabetes mellitus type I, chronic renal failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 150/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths"

   Imaging: Echo:
   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
   dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-11-1**], overall
   LV systolic function has improved slightly. The other findings are
   similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF and DMII with right
   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred
   to ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and
   possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Primarily fluid overload given pulmonary congestion on CXR,
   however is overall net negative for LOS, concern for cardiac etiology,
   however repeat echo reveals relatively improved systolic function  .
   S/p treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete.  On
   Fio2 of 40% w/ PS of 5 and Peep of 5.  Barriers to extubation:
   pulmonary edema, largely resolved.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial and if successful attempt extubation
   today
   - continue ultrafiltration with goal -1L
   - continue olanzapine PRN
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.  Creatinine stable between 4.5 and 5.3.  Only made 140
   ccs of urine yesterday.
   - continue UF
   - keep SBP > 100, avoid nephrotoxicity, renally dose meds
   - renal recs re: continuing UF
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - 25mg metoprolol tid
    - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct trending down.  S/p
   transfusion [**11-13**] with bump, now Hct 27.5, stable.  No evidence
   hemolysis.  Likely combination of slow blood loss and reduced retic
   from renal disease.
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - guiac stool
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse if hct <21
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; on lantus 50 AM and 55 qPM.
   Improved sugars 150 - 200.
   - Continue lantus + SS.
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)
   # FEN: TF, Avoiding IVF, replete electrolytes as necessary.

","The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was admitted to the ICU for multiple reasons including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

The patient has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia and enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently on 40% FiO2 with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 and pressure support (PS) of 5. His barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, which has largely resolved. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial and attempt extubation today if successful. 

The patient has chronic renal failure, likely due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sustained hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed. His creatinine levels are stable between 4.5 and 5.3, and he only produced 140 cc of urine yesterday. The plan is to continue ultrafiltration with a goal of -1L and avoid nephrotoxicity.

   Imaging: Echo:
   The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
   dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
   with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-11-1**], overall
   LV systolic function has improved slightly. The other findings are
   similar.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF and DMII with right
   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred
   to ICU for multiple reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and
   possible AMI.
   ## Hypoxia: Primarily fluid overload given pulmonary congestion on CXR,
   however is overall net negative for LOS, concern for cardiac etiology,
   however repeat echo reveals relatively improved systolic function  .
   S/p treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete.  On
   Fio2 of 40% w/ PS of 5 and Peep of 5.  Barriers to extubation:
   pulmonary edema, largely resolved.
   - given good SBT results, extubation today
   - given resolved pulmonary edema, would stop diuresis: D/c lasix
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.  Creatinine stable between 4.5 and 5.3.  Only made 140
   ccs of urine yesterday.
   - keep SBP > 100, avoid nephrotoxicity, renally dose meds
   - f.u renal recs
 likely dialysis tomorrow
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - 25mg metoprolol tid -> advance to 37. 5 TID for afterload reduction
   esp given extubation and removal of PEEP
    - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct trending down.  S/p
   transfusion [**11-13**] with bump, now Hct 27.5, stable.  No evidence
   hemolysis.  Likely combination of slow blood loss and reduced retic
   from renal disease.
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - guiac stool
   -Switch from IV to PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse if hct <21
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 435**]
   [**2190**].  Enteral nutrition re-initiated; on lantus 50 AM and 55 qPM.
   Improved sugars 150 - 200.  Follow sugars today and adjust lantus as
   necessary (AM sugar was actually low ~95)
   #Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   #Gout: allopurinol 100 mg every other day given poor GFR (renally
   dosed)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). He was transferred to the ICU for multiple reasons, including possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypoxia, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

The patient has shown improvement in overall LV systolic function based on a repeat echo. His pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray (CXR) has resolved, and he is now on FiO2 of 40% with PS of 5 and PEEP of 5. The barriers to extubation include pulmonary edema, which has largely resolved. The patient is expected to be extubated today, and diuretic therapy will be stopped.

The patient is diagnosed with acute/chronic renal failure, likely due to transient atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), sustained hypotension, and intraparenchymal bleed on chronic kidney disease. His creatinine levels have been stable between 4.5 and 5.3, and he has only produced 140 cc of urine yesterday. Renal dosing of medications and maintenance of systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 100 will be prioritized. Dialysis is planned for tomorrow.

The patient also has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type I, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with acute respiratory failure and a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed. He has been extubated and is comfortable on a shovel mask. The patient's ejection fraction has improved to 45-50% according to the trans-thoracic echo.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure due to the retroperitoneal bleed. He has been extubated and is doing well, but careful monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his recent renal recovery remains uncertain. His creatinine levels are slightly higher today, indicating ongoing renal impairment.
3. RP Bleed: The patient has a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed, which has been stable, but needs to be closely monitored.
4. CHF: The patient is being treated for congestive heart failure with amiodarone and beta-blockers for blood pressure control. ACE or ARBs are being held off due to the uncertain degree of renal recovery.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which needs to be addressed and managed appropriately.

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with

   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  He has been treated
   for respiratory distress in the setting of volume overload, which has
   now improved.
   ## Hypoxia:  Resolved.  Etiology was fluid overload given pulmonary
   congestion on CXR.  ECHO negative for significant heart failure.  S/p
   treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - Pt extubated on nasal canula doing well.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.    Likely will require dialysis.  Renal wants to assess
   renal improvement prior to continuing HD.  Currently HD is not urgent.
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - maintain HD line
   - continue diuresis
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - continue metoprolol 37. 5 TID for afterload reduction esp given
   extubation and removal of PEEP
    - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Hypertension
 home diovan held given changing renal function.
   Metoprolol uptitrated to improve blood pressure and prevent pulmonary
   edema.  BP currently below 160s.   HR in 70s.  Can tolerate uptitration
   of BB
   - Increase metoprolol to 50 tid.
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct has been trending down slowly
   over the course of his hospitalization.  Likely due to phelebotimizaton
   and poor red cell production from renal disease.
   - holding ASA and coumadin
   - PO PPI
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse if hct <21

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of CABG, atrial fibrillation, systolic CHF, DMII, and right retroperitoneal bleed. He was admitted with respiratory distress due to volume overload, which has now improved. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, acute/chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, and gout. He is currently extubated and on a nasal cannula, with stable vital signs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress has improved, but there is a possibility of recurrence due to underlying conditions such as chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea.
2. Acute/Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease with acute renal failure due to sustained hypotension, intraparenchymal bleed, and possible rupture of a renal cyst. He may require dialysis, and efforts should be made to avoid nephrotoxins and monitor renal function closely.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has irregular wide complex tachycardia and requires rate control. Metoprolol should be continued, and the dosage may need to be adjusted based on blood pressure and heart rate.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with met"

   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF and DMII with right
   retroperineal  bleed possibly from a renal cyst.  He has been treated
   for respiratory distress in the setting of volume overload, which has
   now improved.
   ## Hypoxia:  Resolved.  Etiology was fluid overload given pulmonary
   congestion on CXR.  ECHO negative for significant heart failure.  S/p
   treatment for klebsiella PNA and enterococcus UTI complete
   - Pt extubated on nasal canula doing well.
   ## Acute / Chronic Renal Failure:  [**3-1**] to ATN from sustained
   hypotension and intraparenchymal bleed on chornic kidney disease.
   Secondly, the rupture of the renal cyst may have further compromised
   renal function.    Likely will require dialysis.  Renal wants to assess
   renal improvement prior to continuing HD.  Currently HD is not urgent.
   - avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - maintain HD line
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  patient with irregular wide complex
   tachycardia up to 140
s, previously symptomatic.   Will continue to
   rate control as needed.
   - continue metoprolol 37. 5 TID for afterload reduction esp given
   extubation and removal of PEEP
    - EP saw patient and felt pacer was functioning appropriately
   - control HR with  metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   ## Hypertension
 home diovan held given changing renal function.
   Metoprolol uptitrated to improve blood pressure and prevent pulmonary
   edema.  BP currently below 160s.   HR in 70s.  Can tolerate uptitration
   of BB
   - Increase metoprolol to 50 tid.
   ##. Anemia: s/p retropeitoneal bleed, hct has been trending down slowly
   over the course of his hospitalization.  Likely due to phelebotimizaton
   and poor red cell production from renal disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type I, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation, and benign hypertension. The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a retroperitoneal bleed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 73 bpm with a normal range of 70-84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/62 mmHg to 167/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute with an inspiratory pattern, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is also on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated yesterday.

Physical examination findings include crackles and wheezes in the chest, symmetric breath sounds, and distended abdomen. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. However, movement, tone, and conversiveness have not been assessed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 351 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 5.1 to 5.5 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 102 to 154 mg"
