","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a history of urosepsis, nephrolithiasis, and nephrostomy tubes. He has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for urosepsis and was febrile, tachycardic, and complaining of pain. The patient has a known Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI) in the past. He recently had his left percutaneous nephrostomy tube replaced by interventional radiology (IR), but is now experiencing fever, tachycardia, left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain, and possible pus at the percutaneous tube site. The source of infection is suspected to be the urinary tract, but pneumonia (PNA) and gastrointestinal (GI) infection should also be considered due to the presence of an ostomy and LLQ abdominal pain. The patient has a recent history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Infection: The patient is suspected to have a urinary tract infection, possibly due to the recent percutaneous tube replacement. Other potential sources include PNA and GI infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further investigation is needed.
2. LLQ abdominal pain: The etiology of the pain is unclear, but it could be related to the recent percutaneous tube change or the presence of a stone. Other possibilities"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a history of urosepsis, nephrolithiasis, and nephrostomy tubes. He has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for urosepsis. The patient presents with fever, tachycardia, and lower left quadrant pain, along with pus at the percutaneous tube site. There are concerns about urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or gastrointestinal infection as potential sources of infection. The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to kidney stones causing obstruction or secondary to infection. Other possible causes include prerenal factors or hypovolemia. The patient has diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, pain control, and further imaging studies to rule out abscesses. The patient will continue with ongoing ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's fever, tachycardia, lower left quadrant pain, and pus at the percutaneous tube site suggest a possible UTI. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever and tachycardia, raise the possibility of pneumonia. This can be confirmed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain following the replacement of a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube for an obstructing renal stone.
- The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and left flank pain.
- He has a history of pseudomonas urinary tract infections and urosepsis.
- The patient's temperature is currently 101.6°F, heart rate is 128 bpm, blood pressure is 125/63 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination findings include poor dentition, distant heart sounds, diminished peripheral pulses, symmetric chest expansion, and diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
- Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the suprapubic area and around the left nephrostomy tube.
- Neurologic examination showed the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, place, and person, and having purposeful movement with normal muscle tone.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels.
- The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth to date.
- Assessment and plan include urinary tract infection, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute and chronic pain management, and potential complications related to diabetes mellitus, Clostridium difficile infection, and previous urinary tract infections"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with fever, tachycardia, and left flank pain after replacement of his left percutaneous nephrostomy tube for an obstructing renal stone. The patient has a history of prior known Pseudomonas urinary tract infections (UTIs) and urosepsis. He is currently on day 2 of antibiotic therapy with cefazidime, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient has a hematoma around his kidney, which could be causing his fever. His white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection.

The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to a hematoma around the kidney in the area of the nephrostomy tube. Pain control has been provided with IV morphine, and urology will re-examine the patient this morning. The patient's sinus tachycardia may be due to pain, hypovolemia, recent fever, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) abnormalities. The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 1.4 from a baseline of 1.0. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is suspected, with a differential diagnosis including pre-renal azotemia and obstructive uropathy. 

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, urinary tract infection, and Clostridium difficile infection. He is alert and oriented, with stable vital signs"

   Fever persists despite antibiotics; awaiting additional cultures. WBC
   up slightly today. Consider double coverage for gram negative bacteria.
   BP has been stable. Patient has received fluid boluses for tachycardia
   (urine output usually good at the time),  with only modest change. Has
   other causes for tachycardia including fever and pain. Suspect the
   latter factors are more likely the cause of tachyardia.
   Worsening acidiosis in non-gap and likely reflects volume resuscitation
   with normal saline. If additional fluids needed, would use lactated
   Ringers.
   Hct down, likely due to hematoma. Patient does not require transfusion
   now and as a Jehovah's witness, he does not want transfusions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has a fever, hypotension, and positive fluid balance, indicating an ongoing infection that may be causing septic shock.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient has moderate pain with gentle percussion of the left abdomen, suggesting possible abdominal pathology.
3. Acidosis: The patient's serum bicarb is falling, indicating metabolic acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have decreased from 36% to 27%, likely due to internal bleeding from the subcapsular hematoma.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and fever, which are signs of a possible UTI.
6. Possible pneumonia: The patient has crackles on auscultation of the chest and a CXR showing a possible infiltrate at the left base, indicating potential pneumonia.

These medical complications require careful management and monitoring in the ICU setting. The patient's condition should be closely monitored for any further deterioration or development of new complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with fever, tachycardia, and left flank pain after replacing his left percutaneous nephrostomy tube for an obstructing renal stone. He has a history of prior known Pseudomonas urinary tract infections and is currently on day 2 of receiving cefazolin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished but overweight/obese, with poor dentition. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds and no murmurs. Peripheral vascular examination indicates diminished pulses in both right and left digits. Respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally. Abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with tenderness around the left nephrostomy tube. Neurologic examination reveals normal tone and attentive behavior. 

Laboratory results include elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.4 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 26.6%, and decreased platelet count (Plt) of 148. Other lab values include elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.7, troponin-T of 0.03, and elevated CK-MB of 2. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is showing signs of urosepsis, with a known history of Pseudomonas urinary tract infections. Urology will evaluate the patient today. The patient is on day 2 of receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefazolin, vancomycin, and metronidazole). If the clinical picture worsens, double coverage for Pseudomonas may be considered.
2. LLQ abdominal pain: This is likely due to a hematoma around the kidney in the area of the nephrostomy tube.
3. Sinus tachycardia: This could be due to pain, hypovolemia, or recent fever. Further evaluation with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is recommended.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline. Differential diagnosis includes pre-renal causes and obstructive causes. Further monitoring of renal function is advised.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient should continue with fasting blood sugar (FS) testing qid and continue outpatient lantus with HISS.
6. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's blood pressure will be monitored, and consideration for beta-blocker therapy will be made.
7. Hyperlipidemia (HL): The patient's stable lipid levels will be managed with continued statin therapy.
8. ICU Care: The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers will be managed accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with fever, tachycardia, and left flank pain after undergoing replacement of his left percutaneous nephrostomy tube for an obstructing renal stone. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient has leukocytosis and a positive urine culture for pseudomonas and GNRs. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics but may require additional coverage for pseudomonas.
2. Hematoma around kidney: The patient has a subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney, which is causing pain. Pain control with IV morphine is recommended, and the urology team will re-examine the patient.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 129, which could be due to the administration of D5W overnight. Mental status remains stable, and other etiologies for hyponatremia should be considered.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has dropped from 36-44 on admission to 26.6, possibly due to an intraabdominal hematoma. Continued monitoring of Hct is advised, and the patient refuses blood transfusions due to religious reasons.
5. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of CVA, neurogenic bladder, NHL, DM, lupus, obstructing renal stones, and colostomy for partial SB obstructions. The patient was admitted with urosepsis. The patient has a subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney and decreased Hct but refuses blood products due to being a Jehovah's Witness. The patient has mild leg pain and is unable to provide history due to a language barrier. The patient is currently on multiple medications including morphine sulfate, ceftazidime, metronidazole, vancomycin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's initial admission was due to urosepsis, which is a severe infection of the urinary tract that can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage and monitor for any signs of worsening infection or organ dysfunction.

2. Renal stones: The patient has a history of obstructing renal stones, which can cause complications such as urinary tract infections and hydronephrosis. Monitoring for any changes in kidney function or further complications related to the renal stones is necessary.

3. Subcapsular hematoma of the left kidney: The patient has a stable subcapsular hematoma, which is a collection of blood beneath the capsule of the kidney. This condition can potentially lead to further bleeding or kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of kidney"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, and cholecystitis. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and left flank pain. He had undergone replacement of his left percutaneous nephrostomy tube due to an obstructing renal stone.

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate in the 109s (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 141/67 to 86/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's general appearance was well-nourished and not in acute distress. However, his conjunctiva was pale, and he had diminished pulses in both lower extremities.

On physical examination, the patient's abdomen was soft with tenderness in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) and suprapubic area. The ostomy and nephrostomy tubes were intact without surrounding tenderness. Neurologically, the patient was attentive, followed simple commands, responded to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, place, and person, and had purposeful movements with normal tone.

Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.4 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 mg/dL"
