","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic left renal renal cell carcinoma and multiple pulmonary lesions, who underwent open debulking radical nephrectomy and renal vein tumor thrombectomy. He was admitted to the ICU for vent monitoring and extubation. The patient has a history of recently diagnosed sleep apnea and a history of smoking without known lung disease. His ABG from 1430 was normal, but he was unable to be extubated post-op and was admitted to the ICU overnight for close monitoring. He currently has leukocytosis with no clear source of infection, holding on antibiotic treatment. The patient also has diabetes, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and hyperkalemia. He underwent tumor debulking today and is enrolled in a trial for vaccination of patients with renal cell cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's recent surgery, history of sleep apnea, and intubation may lead to respiratory complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring and adherence to vent precautions are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis without a clear source of infection indicates the possibility of an upcoming infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased WBC count, or positive cultures, is essential. Proper infection control measures should be maintained.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with metastatic left renal renal cell carcinoma with multiple
   pulmonary lesions and a left renal vein tumor thrombus, now open
   debulking radical nephrectomy and renal vein tumor thrombectomy admited
   to the ICU for vent monitoring/extubation and intensive care
   monitoring.
   #. Respiratory status: Patient has a history of recently diagnosed
   sleep apnea not on CPAP and a history of smoking without known lung
   disease.  Sedation mixed may have caused him to retain CO2 initially.
   He was unable to be extubated post op and was admited to the ICU
   overnight for close monitoring.  He is now extubated and did well
   overnight with occasional sats in the upper 80s.  This was usually
   associated with his NC falling off.
   -NC when sleeping.  Trial of CPAP possibly in house so patient can go
   home with positive pressure until he gets a formal sleep study.

   #. Leukocytosis:  Patient without a clear source of infection at this
   time.  Concerns include pulmonary and urologic.  Recent urine culture
   from [**2160-4-5**] negative.  Lactate was normal.  Afebrile.  Of note patient
   has had a persistent elevation of his WBC throughout [**2159**] ranging from

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic left renal renal cell carcinoma and multiple pulmonary lesions. He underwent an open debulking radical nephrectomy and renal vein tumor thrombectomy and was admitted to the ICU for vent monitoring and intensive care.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory status: The patient has a history of recently diagnosed sleep apnea and a history of smoking without known lung disease. Postoperative sedation may have caused him to retain CO2 initially. He was unable to be extubated post-op and required overnight monitoring in the ICU. He is now extubated but experienced occasional saturation levels in the upper 80s, usually associated with his nasal cannula falling off. A trial of CPAP may be considered for home use until a formal sleep study can be conducted.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count without a clear source of infection at this time. Concerns include pulmonary and urologic infections. Recent urine culture from [**2160-4-5**] was negative. Lactate levels were normal, and the patient appears to be at his baseline. Follow-up culture data from blood and urine should be monitored.
3. Diabetes: Metformin is currently being held, and the patient will be covered with ISS.

   61 yo male with Renal Cell CA now s/p tumor debulking and with
   admission to ICU with post operatively with persistent respiratory
   failure.  He now has had good stability following extubation.  This
   issue of concern was potential for overnight desaturations without CPAP
   treatment but he did appear able to tolerate with supplemental oxygen
   only.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue with supplemental oxygen and wean as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma who underwent tumor debulking surgery and was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative respiratory failure. The patient has been stable following extubation, with no overnight desaturations while on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he is unable to tolerate weaning off supplemental oxygen or if there is a recurrence of desaturation events.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
3. Surgical Site Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections at the surgical site, which can be serious and require further treatment.
4. Renal Cell Cancer Recurrence: Although the patient has undergone tumor debulking surgery, there is still a possibility of recurrence or spread of the renal cell cancer, requiring ongoing monitoring and further treatment as advised by the surgery team and oncology.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional factors may contribute to the patient's overall risk profile."
