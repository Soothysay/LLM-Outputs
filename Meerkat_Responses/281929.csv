","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the left main coronary artery. He presented to the cardiac care unit (CCU) with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including chest pain, ECG changes, and pulmonary edema. The initial assessment indicated a high clinical concern for ACS, with possible pulmonary embolism (PE) and aortic dissection as considerations. However, the patient's condition has improved with therapy for ACS, and there are no specific findings to suggest those etiologies at this time. 

The patient's current diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired transfers, altered mental status (not delirium), hypernatremia (high sodium), impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and a history of CABG and BMS placement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (74-107), blood pressure of 151/62 mmHg (104/46-151/103), respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (21-30), oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, and they have been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, and coronary ischemia. 

The patient has impaired knowledge, muscle performance, range of motion, transfers, altered mental status (not delirium), hypernatremia (high sodium), impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104 to 151 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, as well as decreased platelet count. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, nitroglycerin, metoprolol, famotidine, and others. The patient has allergies to Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium) and experiences muscle pain as a side effect. The patient has received nafcillin and vancomycin antibiotics.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,111 mL, including 667 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 1,625 mL, primarily through urine.

The patient requires respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.26.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, normal heart sounds, limited respiratory effort due to body habitus, and an inability to assess jugular venous pressure (JVP).

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was subsequently admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including chest pain, ECG changes, and pulmonary edema. However, the troponin levels were negative, indicating no specific cardiac damage.

The patient's current condition includes left heart failure, as shown by reduced ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The pulmonary edema has improved with treatment for heart failure. A repeat formal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned.

The patient's rhythm is sinus with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and trigeminy, and there is a history of atrial fibrillation (AF). Beta-blockers are being continued to manage the ACS and tachycardia. Digoxin and Coumadin (warfarin) are also restarted.

The patient has MSSA/CONS bacteremia, but currently not bacteremic. Hardware removal is recommended, and vancomycin is continued for a prespecified duration after the first negative culture. Nafcillin will be changed once the vancomycin course is completed. Rifampin and gentamicin are held for now.

   ECG changes, and pulmonary edema.  PE and dissection are
   considerations, but has improved with therapy for ACS, and no specific
   findings to point towards those etiologies at this time so will hold on
   CTA for now. Also troponins have been negative.
   Treat heart failure for now, if no improvement consider cardiac cath at

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was subsequently admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) due to flash pulmonary edema and bacteremia/hardware infection. 

The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including chest pain, ECG changes, and pulmonary edema. However, the troponin levels were negative, and the patient has improved with therapy for ACS. 

The assessment and plan include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain, ECG changes, and initial concern for ACS have improved with therapy. However, further evaluation may be required if symptoms persist or worsen.

2. Impaired Knowledge: The patient's impaired knowledge or understanding of his condition should be addressed through patient education.

3. Impaired Muscle Performance: The patient's impaired muscle performance, possibly related to medication side effects or reduced physical activity, should be evaluated and managed accordingly.

4. Impaired Range of Motion: Limited range of motion may be present due to the patient's body habitus and immobilization. Physical therapy or other interventions may be necessary.

5. Impaired Transfers: The patient's impaired ability to transfer himself from one place to another may be due to muscle weakness or limited mobility. Assistance during transfers should be provided until strength improves.

6. Altered Mental Status"

   bacteremia/hardware infection and now admitted to the CCU noted to be
   in flash pulmonary edema.
   # CORONARIES: initially high clinical concern for ACS given chest pain,
   ECG changes, and pulmonary edema.  PE and dissection are
   considerations, but has improved with therapy for ACS, and no specific
   findings to point towards those etiologies at this time so will hold on
   CTA for now. Troponins have been negative, although patient has new
   inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis suggesting possible stenosis of
   the SVG graft to RCA. LDL 132. A1c 4.9.
   -consider cardiac cath
   -Continue ASA 325
   -Continue metoprolol 100 TID
   -continue zetia.
   -
   # PUMP:  Left heart failure.  Echo shows reduced EF and new focal wall
   motion abnormalities, and CXR shows pulmonary edema which is markedly
   improved this am.   Diuresed well to Lasix 40 mg IV.
   - beta-blockade given ACS and tachycardia
   - Continue lasix boluses with 40 IV PRN, goal negative 500cc-1L
   - [**Hospital1 **] lyte checks
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus with frequent PVC's/trigeminy, h/o a.fib
   - monitor on tele
   - beta-blockade
   - continue digoxin
   - restart Coumadin, no heparin bridge
   .
   # MSSA/CONS Bacteremia: ID notes pt not bacteremic currently but
   hardware should be removed. Continued vancomycin for prespecified
   duration of 7 days after first negative culture ([**2-17**]). Started
   nafcillin.
   - Continue nafcillin.
   - hold on rifampin/gent for now
   - ortho to address hardware as outpatient
   - f/u ID recs
   - renally dose nafcillin

   # Hypoxemia: Likely [**1-26**] pulmonary edema.  Nothing by history to suggest
   aspiration or HCAP , ? demand from thrombus in heart
   - Lasix 40mg IV
   - home CPAP overnight
   - trend  WBC
   -serial CXR
   .
   # Delerium: Likely [**1-26**] opiates/benzos and acute illness. Noted to have
   pre-existing memory issues, which may predispose to delirium.
   - repeat  Head CT.
   - frequent reorientation
   - minimize opiods/benzos/anticholinergic meds

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was found to have bacteremia/hardware infection. He was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) and initially had high clinical concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to chest pain, ECG changes, and pulmonary edema. However, his condition improved with therapy for ACS, and specific findings for pulmonary embolism (PE) and dissection are not evident at this time. 

The patient's echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) and new focal wall motion abnormalities, suggesting possible stenosis of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right coronary artery (RCA). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/80 mmHg to 154/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)/trigeminy. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, mildly elevated creatinine, negative troponin T levels, elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment and plan include consideration for cardiac catheterization, continuation of aspirin, metop"

   # Altered mental status: Disorientation and reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle in a man who has recently been receiving benzodiazepines and
   other sedating meds consistent with delirium, although patient is
   relatively young (59).  Past medical records indicate a history of
   memory impairment, so it is possible patient has an underlying
   cognitive deficit that predisposes him to delirium, although this
   history is not clear.  Patient has a large volume of distribution,
   which might be associated with delayed clearance of opioids. Concern
   would be for septic emboli to the brain in the setting of recent
   intracardiac infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   59 y/o M w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, and BMS to Left Main a/w
   bacteremia/hardware infection and now admitted to the CCU noted to be
   in flash pulmonary edema.  Currently, most active problem is altered
   mental status.
   # Altered mental status: Disorientation and reversal of sleep-wake
   cycle in a man who has recently been receiving benzodiazepines and
   other sedating meds consistent with delirium, although patient is
   relatively young (59).  Past medical records indicate a history of
   memory impairment, so it is possible patient has an underlying
   cognitive deficit that predisposes him to delirium, although this
   history is not clear.  Patient has a large volume of distribution,
   which might be associated with delayed clearance of opioids. Concern
   would be for septic emboli to the brain in the setting of recent
   intracardiac infection.
   - CT head with contrast; will need PIV for power PICC for contrast
   bolus
   - avoid anticholinergic meds, benzos, or opioids
   - neurology consult given persistently altered mental status
   # CORONARIES: Initially high clinical concern for ACS given chest pain,
   ECG changes, and pulmonary edema.  Troponins have been negative,
   although patient has decreased EF and new inferior and inferolateral
   hypokinesis. LDL 132. A1c 4.9.
   -consider cardiac cath in future; not right now
   -Continue ASA 325
   -Continue metoprolol 100 TID
   -continue Zetia
   -
   # PUMP:  Left heart failure.  Echo shows reduced EF and new focal wall
   motion abnormalities, and CXR shows pulmonary edema which is generally
   improved this am.  Diuresed very well to Lasix 40 mg IV.
   - beta-blockade given ACS and tachycardia
   - Bolus with Lasix 20 mg IV for less aggressive diuresis
   - [**Hospital1 **] lyte checks
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus with frequent PVC's/trigeminy, h/o a.fib
   - monitor on tele
   - beta-blockade
   - continue digoxin
   - on Coumadin; monitor INR
   .
   # MSSA/CONS Bacteremia: ID notes pt not bacteremic currently but
   hardware should be removed. Continued vancomycin for prespecified
   duration of 7 days after first negative culture ([**2-17**]). Started
   nafcillin.
   - Continue nafcillin.
   - hold on rifampin/gent for now
   - ortho to address hardware as outpatient
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # R-Atrial Foreign Body/Fibrin Sheath:
   - abx/ no need to remove as per ID. No heparin for now.
   .
   # OSA: Home CPAP overnight.  If patient retains O2 at night, this could
   worsen mental status.
   .
   # Depression: home medications.
   .
   # Gout: Allopurinol -> renally dose
   .
   FEN:
   - low sodium, heart healthy

   ACCESS:
   -PICC

   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SC
   -Pain management with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace

","Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a stent placement in the left main coronary artery. He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) due to bacteremia/hardware infection and flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's current active problems include altered mental status, which is characterized by disorientation and reversal of sleep-wake cycle. This could be related to recent benzodiazepine and other sedating medications, but the patient may have an underlying cognitive deficit as well. There is concern for septic emboli to the brain in the setting of recent intracardiac infection.

Other significant findings include coronary artery disease with negative troponin levels, left heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and new focal wall motion abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

The patient is currently being treated with various medications such as nafcillin for MSSA/cons bacteremia, lasix for left heart failure, metoprolol for ACS, and digoxin for rhythm control. The patient's lines include a multi-lumen line, and he is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin SC for DVT, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and VAP prevention with elevation"
