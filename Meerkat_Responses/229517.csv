","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of allogenic bone marrow transplant for erythroleukemia/MDS. She was admitted with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has been receiving empiric antibiotic therapy and has shown improvement without recurrence of symptoms. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 50 bpm and blood pressure within normal range. She is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, heparin, pantoprazole, and various antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and mild anemia. Her cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, but without EKG changes suggestive of ischemia. The patient has also shown signs of nausea, vomiting, and prolonged QT interval.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible septic picture. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's ongoing diarrhea may indicate an underlying infection or gastrointestinal involvement. Further investigation through stool cultures is necessary to identify the cause and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: Although the patient is currently on nasal cannula oxygen, close monitoring of respiratory status is crucial to prevent the development of acute respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female who underwent an allogenic bone marrow transplant for erythroleukemia/MDS. She presented with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension, which are concerning for a septic picture. She also has elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and diarrhea. Other possible differentials include hypovolemic diarrhea, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with positive troponin, demand ischemia, adrenal insufficiency, and gastrointestinal viral or bacterial infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 50 bpm and blood pressure of 108/56 mmHg. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and steroids. Her renal function is improving, and she is being hydrated with lactated Ringer's solution. Further diagnostic tests such as stool cultures, blood cultures, and a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis are pending. The patient will continue to receive empiric antibiotic therapy and will be monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: Given the patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count, there is a high suspicion of sepsis. If not appropriately managed, this could progress to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient initially presented with an elevated creatinine level and non-gap metabolic acidosis, which could indicate acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a sibling-matched bone marrow transplant (BMT) on 3/23. She presented to the emergency department with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a history of GVHD mouth and colon. Her symptoms resolved completely by lunch on 3/26 but recurred from 9 AM to 12 PM on 3/30. She reported another episode at 9 PM. On 3/31, she experienced increasing frequency of diarrhea, accompanied by lightheadedness and ""eyes rolling back in her head"" but no loss of consciousness or head trauma. She was brought to the emergency department and diagnosed with sepsis. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation. Her lactate levels were elevated at 2.4, and she required norepinephrine for blood pressure support. She was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension, which are indicative of sepsis. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation.
2. Diarrhea: The patient has had multiple episodes of diarrhea, which may be due to infection, GVHD, or other causes.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, requiring vasop"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a sibling-matched bone marrow transplant (BMT) on 03/23. She presented to the emergency department with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. The initial workup revealed an elevated white blood cell count with bandemia, suggesting an infection. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and received aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Further evaluation showed an elevated cardiac troponin level, indicating possible myocardial injury. However, the EKG did not show active ischemic changes, and the cardiologist agreed that anticoagulation was not necessary. The patient's condition improved with continued IV fluids, and she was weaned off vasopressors.

The patient's diarrhea persisted despite antibiotic therapy, and stool cultures were sent. A colonoscopy was considered to evaluate for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's renal function was impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.4, likely due to dehydration and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Intravenous fluids were administered, and the creatinine level trended down to baseline.

The patient has a history of erythroleukemia evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and underwent allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched sibling donor. She has been doing well over the past year but experienced mild GVHD"

   62 yo woman with with presyncope, found to be hypotensive in setting of
   diarrhea, possible adrenal insufficiency vs sepsis.
   1. Hypotension vs sepsis: diarrhea/hypovolemia as most likely primary
   etiology exacerbated by sepsis vs AI. Responsed well to initial fluid
   resusitation but overnight was bolused and remained negative overall.
   Good urine output.  Has low baseline cortisol of 3, and did not respond
   to cosyntropin as well - switch to hydrocortisone as stress dose. Wean
   levophed today as tolerated.
   2. Diarrhea/fever: Now on CTX/flagyl/vanc (held fluoroquinolones given
   QT-prologation). No other sources of fever for the moment.  F/u
   cultures, stool studies to be sent, check influenza DFA. ID input
   appreciated.
   3. cardiac ischemia:  troponins trending down, no evidence for acute
   coronary syndrome.  Likely demand ischemia with leak. Getting aspirin.
   4. ARF: Cr improving in setting of adequate fluid resusitation.
   5. Non-gap acidosis: Likely due to saline resuscitation, vomiting
   6. On simvastatin vs placebo in sepsis study. Call [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 831**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 313**] if any
   concerns.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with presyncope, hypotension, and diarrhea. She is suspected to have possible adrenal insufficiency or sepsis. She received initial fluid resuscitation but remained hypotensive overnight. Her urine output was good, and she had a low baseline cortisol level of 3. She did not respond well to the cosyntropin stimulation test, so she was switched to hydrocortisone as a stress dose. Levophed was weaned off today as she tolerated it well. The patient also has diarrhea and fever, and she is being treated with CTX/flagyl/vanc. Cultures and stool studies will be sent, and influenza DFA will be checked. There is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome, and her troponins are trending down. She has acute kidney injury with improving creatinine levels in the setting of adequate fluid resuscitation. She also has non-gap acidosis, likely due to saline resuscitation and vomiting. The patient is part of a sepsis study involving simvastatin versus placebo. She requires critical care in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low baseline cortisol level and poor response to the cosyntropin stimulation test suggest adrenal insufficiency. This condition can lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypot"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of allogenic bone marrow transplant for erythroleukemia/MDS, who presents with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's initial presentation is concerning for sepsis, given the fever, elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and diarrhea. The source of infection is unclear, as the patient has not had any recent antibiotics or gastrointestinal symptoms. Other possible diagnoses include hypovolemic diarrhea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has been weaned off vasopressor support and is tolerating regular diet.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and renal impairment with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities on echocardiogram.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for further infections due to immunosuppression from the bone marrow transplant. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms could also indicate a possible Clostridium difficile infection, which should be ruled out with stool cultures. Additionally, the patient's prolonged QT interval and sinus bradycardia require close monitoring and avoidance of medications that may prolong the QT interval.

Overall, the patient requires continued ICU care, including monitoring of vital signs,"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of allogenic bone marrow transplantation for erythroleukemia/MDS. She presents with fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has not had any previous episodes of diarrhea symptoms in the house, and her CT abdomen/pelvis shows no pathology. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemic diarrhea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and bandemia suggest an infection. However, the source of infection is unclear. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and stool cultures are pending.
2. Hypovolemic diarrhea: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and hypotension could be due to hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated, and stool cultures are pending.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or hypoxia.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's profound hypotension could be related to adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone has been administered, and the plan is to taper off once the patient is no longer hypotensive.
5. Cardiogenic shock: Although the patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, cardiogenic shock is unlikely based on"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo woman with with presyncope, found to be hypotensive in setting of
   diarrhea, possible adrenal insufficiency vs sepsis (bandemia).
   1. Hypotension vs sepsis: diarrhea/hypovolemia as most likely primary
   etiology exacerbated by possible sepsis vs AI. Responsed well to
   initial fluid resusitation and now off pressors. Good urine output.
   Has low baseline cortisol of 3, and did not respond to cosyntropin as
   well - on HC 100 TID. Will switch to pred 60 [**Hospital1 **]. Suggest rapid taper
   down to home dose of 5 mg daily.
   2. Diarrhea/fever: Now on Vanc/CTX/flagyl/Cipro. No other sources of
   fever for the moment. F/u cultures, stool studies. ID input
   appreciated. Will d/c vanc and CFTX.
   3. cardiac ischemia:  troponins trending down, no evidence for acute
   coronary syndrome.  Likely demand ischemia with leak. Getting aspirin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old woman who presented with presyncope and was found to be hypotensive in the setting of diarrhea, possible adrenal insufficiency vs sepsis (bandemia).
- She responded well to initial fluid resuscitation and is now off pressors. Good urine output.
- Her baseline cortisol level is low at 3, and she did not respond well to cosyntropin stimulation test - on HC 100 TID. Will switch to prednisone 60 [**Hospital1 **]. Suggest rapid taper down to home dose of 5 mg daily.
- She has diarrhea and fever, currently being treated with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and Cipro. No other sources of fever identified. Follow-up cultures and stool studies are planned. ID input appreciated. Will discontinue Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
- There are no signs of acute coronary syndrome, and troponins are trending down. Likely demand ischemia with leak. Getting aspirin.
- Her creatinine levels are improving, suggesting prerenal azotemia.
- She has non-gap acidosis, which is improving.
- She is participating in a simvastatin vs placebo trial in sepsis study. Please contact [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 831**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 313**] if any concerns.
- ICU care includes PO diet, glycemic control, removal of subclavian line today, presep catheter in place, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP prevention measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension vs sepsis: The patient's initial hypotension could be due to possible sepsis or adrenal insufficiency. It responded well to fluid resuscitation, but the underlying cause needs further investigation.
2. Diarrhea/fever: The patient has ongoing diarrhea and fever, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Current antibiotic regimen includes Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and Cipro. Monitoring for response and sending follow-up cultures and stool studies will be important.
3. Cardiac ischemia: Although troponins are trending down, there is still a concern for cardiac ischemia. The patient will receive aspirin to prevent further complications.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels were initially elevated but are improving, suggesting prerenal azotemia.
5. Non-gap acidosis: The patient initially had non-gap acidosis, but it is improving.
6. Potential complications from long-term steroid use: The patient is being placed on a high dose of prednisone, which may lead to long-term steroid side effects if not managed properly. Regular monitoring and tapering down to home dose of 5 mg daily is recommended."
