","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with unknown weight. They have been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions, including pneumonia, anemia due to blood loss from a gastric vessel bleed, elevated cardiac enzymes indicating demand ischemia, COPD with no active issues, and laryngeal cancer. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure of 151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for the gastric bleed and underwent surgical oversewing of the bleeding site. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been monitored, and they are currently at 9.2 g/dL. Medications such as vancomycin and piperacillin were administered on [**2173-8-6**]. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.9 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) levels ranging from 23.5% to 31.5%, and platelet count (Plt) of 248 K/uL. Other lab values indicate slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels of 0.7-0.8 mg/dL, low troponin-T levels of 0.09, and normal glucose levels ranging from 88-154 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia, and certain areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments were not performed. An image of the chest X-ray (CXR) was mentioned but not provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient experienced a gastric vessel bleed leading to anemia and required transfusion of PRBC. There is a risk of re-bleeding or ongoing blood loss.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has LLL infiltrate on CXR, indicating pneumonia. Failure to respond to antibiotics or progression of the infection could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: Elevated cardiac enzymes suggest myocardial injury, which may be related to demand ischemia due to the patient's other medical conditions. Continued cardiac stress could lead to further myocardial damage or heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's low Hct levels indicate anemia. If not properly managed, it could lead to tissue hypoxia, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to organs.
5. COPD Exacerbation: Although no active issues were reported in the COPD, the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of COPD exacerbation.
6. Laryngeal Cancer: The patient has advanced laryngeal cancer, which may require ongoing management and treatment.
7. DVT/PE: Immobility and ICU stay increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. VAP: The use of endotracheal tubes and mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Medication Reactions/Interactions: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and there is a risk of drug interactions, allergic reactions, or adverse effects.
10. Infection Control: Proper infection control measures should be maintained to prevent nosocomial infections.

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive, and other potential complications may arise based on the patient's clinical course."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of SCCa undergoing XRT, admitted for pneumonia and developed GI bleed. He underwent an emergency laparotomy for UGIB four days ago. Last night, he required increased oxygen, and a chest X-ray showed a left-sided effusion and stable bibasilar infiltrates. This morning, he presented with tachypnea, heart rate in the 130s, SpO2 of 85% on 1.5 LPM, and another episode of melena. Dexamethasone was given for possible airway edema related to mucus plugging. In the ICU, thick plugs were suctioned from his mouth and throat. He is on a PICC line and multi-lumen TLC. His allergies include no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 08/06/2173 at 07:50 AM and piperacillin on 08/06/2173 at 04:30 PM. He is currently on various ICU medications. His medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure of 151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 96% on 1.5 LPM. His heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. His hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support information are provided in the flowsheet. Physical examination findings include general appearance of being overweight/obese, PERRL eyes/conjunctiva, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, crackles in the respiratory/chest area, soft non-tender stapled abdominal wound, and absent edema in the extremities. Neurologically, he is attentive and follows simple commands. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 3.2 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Imaging shows stable patchy infiltrates and loss of the left hemidiaphragm on chest X-ray, and an ECG showing sinus tachycardia without evidence of ischemia. The assessment and plan include pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated), respiratory distress/hypoxemia likely related to mucus plugging, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed (melena), altered mental status, and ICU care. The patient's condition remains critically ill."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 50**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP) - still on
   antibiotics
   respiratory distress/hypoxemia - likely related to mucus plugging,
   improved, less likely PE
 HYPERTENSION - increase captopril, metoprolol
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) - recent
   surgery for oversewing of oozing gastric vessel, another episode of
   melena - follow Hct, hold ASA and plavix, access OK
   altered mental status - follow, recent head CT unrevealing

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of SCCa undergoing XRT, admitted for pna, and developed GI bleed. He underwent an ex-lap for UGIB four days ago. Last night, he required increased O2 needs, and a chest x-ray showed a larger effusion and infiltrates. This morning, he was tachypneic, with a heart rate of 130's, blood pressure in the 180's, and oxygen saturation at 85% on 1.5 LPM. He also experienced another episode of melena and received dexamethasone for airway edema. The patient has a history of hypertension and anemia. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, and altered mental status. On examination, he had crackles in his chest and absent peripheral pulses. His labs showed a low white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine, and low platelet count. Imaging revealed stable patchy infiltrates on a chest x-ray and no ischemia on an electrocardiogram. The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, and altered mental status. The plan is to continue antibiotics, increase captopril and metoprolol, monitor hemoglobin, hold ASA and Plavix, and follow up on altered mental status. The patient is critically ill."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has pneumonia, which is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated. They also have acute respiratory failure, but it is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, the patient has hypertension, gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), and upper gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and high blood pressure. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 88%, indicating some level of respiratory compromise. The patient's weight has increased from 71 kg at admission to 78 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,060 mL and output of 1,440 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -380 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool face tent and supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head, neck, or cardiovascular system. However, the patient does have decreased breath sounds in the chest, abdomen that is soft and non-tender, and no edema or calf pain in the extremities.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and slightly elevated potassium and creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable within normal range.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of pneumonia, pain control, hypertension, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  Finally, PE is a possibility in a patient with
   tachycardia and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient
   is at high risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy,
   and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Tracheal edema appears to be less
   likely as the patient has had no problems with ventilation.  COPD
   exacerbation also unlikely given lack of wheezing on exam.  Patient
   received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates
   hemodynamic instability or additional melanotic stools will hold
   cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary
   PPx: SCDs and PPI
   Access: Right Hickman (single lumen), midline both placed at OSH.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with laryngeal cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and underwent an exploratory laparotomy. The patient then developed hypoxic respiratory distress and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), gastrointestinal bleeding (upper, melena), hypertension, and altered mental status (AMS) secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation, respiratory distress, and HAP. The patient also has a history of cancer, CAD, COPD, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown signs of respiratory distress and increased oxygen requirements, which could indicate worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's risk factors such as recent surgery, active malignancy, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis only with sequential compression devices (SCDs), there is a possibility of PE.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient presented with melena, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to monitor for any further bleeding episodes and manage accordingly.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which needs to be"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Fluctuating oxygen requirements
 ranging from
   4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2.  Suctioning copius, bloody thick plugs
   from nasopharynx and back of throat.  Possible etiologies of increased
   oxygen requirements most likely include mucus plug with inability to
   clear upper airway secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP,
   aspiration event, intracardiac shunt or pulmonary emboli.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - TTE to evaluate volume status and possible PFO (see below)
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement yesterday and has
   continued to have guiac positive stools.  She is now POD 4 from
   ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee grounds.
   Serial Hct have been stable
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Fluctuating altered mental status s/p extubation persists.
   Likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure,
   intubation, respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with
   question of parietal lobe hypodensity.  Neurology consult suspects
   right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left
   sided hypoaesthesia.  Neuro also recommended MRI/MRA of head and neck
   which the patient refused.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - talk to neuro regarding starting ASA, hold off on plavix
   - carotid dopplers and TTE with bubble study to evaluate for source of
   possible emboli
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   -Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   -neuro recommends keeping BP elevated from 160-200 to prevent further
   ischemia
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates hemodynamic
   instability or additional melanotic stools will hold cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with laryngeal cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia and had a gastrointestinal bleed after an exploratory laparotomy. The patient is now in the medical intensive care unit for hypoxic respiratory distress. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing fluctuating oxygen requirements, ranging from 4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2. There are several possible etiologies for the increased oxygen requirements, including mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening hospital-acquired pneumonia, aspiration event, intracardiac shunt, or pulmonary emboli.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had one black tarry bowel movement yesterday and continues to have guiac positive stools. She is now on day 4 post exploratory laparotomy. Serial Hct have been stable, indicating no significant blood loss.

3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient is currently on day 9 of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. It is important to continue the current antimicrobials.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has fluctuating altered mental status since extubation. It is likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation, respiratory distress, and hospital-ac"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old female with laryngeal cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
- She was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia and developed gastrointestinal bleeding after an exploratory laparotomy.
- She is now in the medical intensive care unit for hypoxic respiratory distress.
- The patient's oxygen requirements have fluctuated, ranging from 4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2. There are several possible etiologies, including mucus plug, pulmonary edema, worsening hospital-acquired pneumonia, aspiration event, intracardiac shunt, or pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has had guaiac-positive stools and melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Her hemoglobin levels have been stable, and she has been given blood transfusions as necessary.
- She is currently on day 9 of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- The patient also has altered mental status, which is likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation, respiratory distress, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Neurology consult suspects a right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left-sided hypoaesthesia. The patient refused an MRI/MRA of the head and neck.
- Her blood pressure is elevated at 180/100, and there is concern for increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion. Neurology recommends keeping"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  Finally, PE is a possibility in a patient with
   tachycardia and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient
   is at high risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy,
   and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Tracheal edema appears to be less
   likely as the patient has had no problems with ventilation.  COPD
   exacerbation also unlikely given lack of wheezing on exam.  Patient
   received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates
   hemodynamic instability or additional melanotic stools will hold
   cardiac meds.
