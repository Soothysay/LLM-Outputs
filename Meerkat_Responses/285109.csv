   increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents.  Aggressive IVFs for
   MAPS >60 mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed (levophed as first line). Would
   trend lactates and place CVL and a-line for improved access and

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated 22-month course following a traumatic splenic laceration, splenic embolization, infarct, and splenic abscess that required surgical splenectomy. He also has a cutaneous fistula, persistent intraabdominal polymicrobial abscess requiring percutaneous drain, tracheostomy, and other medical interventions. The patient presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and distention, and subsequent hospital course notable for left pleural effusion due to pneumonia and CT placement, discharge on [12-6], fevers and leukocytosis. He was found to have gram-positive bacteremia yesterday, with the removal of the PICC line and initiation of vancomycin. Overnight, he experienced intractable vomiting, leading to hypoxemia and aspiration. Antibiotics were broadened, and he was transferred to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to multiple infectious precipitants including C. diff colitis, aspiration pneumonia, line infection, and intra-abdominal abscess.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, hypovolemia, increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents. Aggressive IV fluids and vasopressors are needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Hypoxemia"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history who was transferred to the ICU with a septic picture, including fevers, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient has had a prolonged and complicated hospital course after a splenic laceration with splenectomy, polymicrobial infection from a splenic abscess, and other medical issues. He also has a history of COPD and recent aspiration event. The patient's current conditions include possible Clostridium difficile colitis, line infection, polymicrobial collection from a splenic abscess, and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient's physical examination reveals distended abdomen with purulent drainage from a Jackson-Pratt drain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with signs of septic shock, including fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. The sepsis could be attributed to multiple infectious sites, including a polymicrobial infection from a splenic abscess, Clostridium difficile colitis, line infection, and respiratory tract infection.

   --Broad antbxs to cover multiple potential and known infectious
   precipitants including  c diff, asp pna, line infection, and intra-abd
   abscess--flagyl IV and PO vanco tobra, IV vanco and cefepime. ID
   consult to guide antbx coverage. Surgical input regarding ongoing
   management of splenic fluid collection seen on CT,? need for
   replacement of perc drain, vs. washout.  Check KUB given vomiting to
   r/o perf, obstruction, and to eval for evidence of toxic megacolon.
   Once more HD stabilized consider repeat CT.
   -Hypotension appears multifactorial and [**1-21**] sepsis, hypovolemia,
   increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents.  Aggressive IVFs for
   MAPS >60 mmHg.  Vasopressor as needed (levophed as first line). Would
   trend lactates and place CVL and a-line for improved access and
   invasive BP monitoring. Once adequately fluid resus check SVO2.
   --His tachycardia is likely from fevers, infection and hypovolemia.
   Would hold on nodal agents and reassess after adequate fluid ressus.
   Send CEs and check ECG.
   --Respiratory distress and hypoxia attributed to evolving infection in
   setting of aspiration event, on background of COPD with significant
   bulus lung ds.  ABGs with low threshold for replacement on ventilator.
   Remainder as outlined in resident note.

   Addendum;
   Pt continues to mentate and is maintaining O2 sats on TM without
   evidence of fatiguing.  He remains hypotensive, requiring vasopressor

   shows increased ASD likely from asp pna.  Abd findings discussed with
   surgery.  No evidence of toxic megacolon.  Will monitor serial abd

   via trach if becomes academic or fatigues.  ID input appreciated
   regarding complicated antibx for severe C diff, line infection, and asp
   pna.  Pt remains critically ill and very tensuous.  Will obtain us of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated 22-month course following a traumatic splenic laceration, splenic embolization with infarct and splenic abscess necessitating surgical splenectomy, cutaneous fistula, persistent intraabdominal polymicrobial abscess requiring percutaneous drain, tracheostomy, pleural effusion treated with pleurodesis and chest tube placement, and a history of COPD.

The patient presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and distention. He was found to have an left pleural effusion secondary to pneumonia and had a central line infection. He developed intractable vomiting leading to hypoxemia and aspiration pneumonia. He also had ongoing fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension despite treatment. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

Physical examination findings include a thin elderly male who is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. He has coarse breath sounds with symmetrical chest wall movement. His abdomen is soft and distended with a percutaneous drain in place, showing purulent drainage"

   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), including intra-abdominal
   abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing 4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods,
   3+ GPCs), line infection (PICC removed [**2132-12-8**]), pneumonia (witnessed
   aspiration event).  Most obvious source for overwhelming infection
   would be C diff, especially given finding of pneumatosis on CT
   (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous fistula).
   Bilateral pneumonia with pneural fluid growing pseudomonas  Now fluid
   resuscitated, but continues on pressor support.
   - attempt to wean pressors, but maintain MAP > 65.
   - Treat empirically with vanc IV PO and PR, flagyl and cefepime
   - Fluid resuscitation with NS
   -ID following; have requested pseudomonas sensitivities, also suggested
   +/- adding amikacin
   - Follow culture data and narrow as tolerated
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, CXR shows LLL pna.  The patient has had
   a left sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax
   during this admission.  CXR on arrival shows developing left sided
   infiltrate, likely secondary to recent aspiration event.  No evidence
   of recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Will maintain on
   trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - Appreciate IP and thoracics recommendations
   - Continue atrovent nebulizers standing and PRN
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appears to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  As the patient's blood pressures are borderline, appears
   to be developing septic physiology, likely tachycardia is
   compensatory.
   - Hold additional nodal agents
   - Treat with IV fluid boluses
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKG on arrival shows sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
   Will continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Currently hypotensive, hold all anti-hypertensives.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including splenic bleed, splenectomy, colonic fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and pleural effusion. He was admitted with fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula, line infection, and pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, Clostridium difficile infection, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's fluid balance shows an input-output mismatch, indicating a possible electrolyte and fluid disorder. This could lead to imbalances in sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes, as well as fluid overload or dehydration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's multiple sources of bacteremia and positive blood cultures indicate ongoing sepsis. If not treated promptly and effectively, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pneumonia with growth of pseudomonas in pleural fluid. If not treated appropriately, the pneumonia can worsen, leading to respiratory failure and decreased oxygenation.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has tested positive for C. diff, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. If left untreated"

   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), including intra-abdominal
   abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing 4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods,
   3+ GPCs), line infection (PICC removed [**2132-12-8**]), pneumonia (witnessed
   aspiration event).  Most obvious source for overwhelming infection
   would be C diff, especially given finding of pneumatosis on CT
   (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous fistula).  Also has
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR with pneural fluid growing pseudomonas.  Now
   fluid resuscitated, but continues on pressor support.
   - attempt to wean pressors, but maintain MAP > 65.
   - Treat empirically with vanc IV, PO, and PR, and flagyl.  Will change
   cefepime to tigecycline today, as it covers broadly and may confer
   additional treatment for c diff.
   - ID following, recs appreciated; have requested pseudomonas
   sensitivities, also suggested +/- adding amikacin
   - Follow culture data and narrow as tolerated
   - Will cancel TTE, as patient clinically much improved
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, CXR shows LLL pna.  The patient has had
   a left sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax
   during this admission.  CXR on arrival shows developing left sided
   infiltrate, likely secondary to recent aspiration event.  No evidence
   of recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Will maintain on
   trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - Appreciate IP and thoracics recommendations
   - Continue atrovent nebulizers standing and PRN
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved with fluid resuscitation, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKG on arrival shows sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
   Will continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Currently hypotensive, hold all anti-hypertensives.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including splenic bleed, abscess, splenectomy, colo-cutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess drainage, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion drainage, and pneumothorax. He was transferred from the floor for fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), pneumonia, and aspiration. He has multiple sources of bacteremia, including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula, line infection, and pneumonia. He is currently on pressor support, being treated empirically with vancomycin, Flagyl, and cefepime, which will be changed to tigecycline due to its broad coverage including C. diff. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, and he will continue on tracheostomy with aggressive suctioning as needed. Tachycardia resolved with fluid resuscitation, and the EKG shows sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes. All anti-hypertensives have been held due to hypotension. The patient's care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient"

   - Follow culture data and narrow as tolerated
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, CXR shows LLL pna.  The patient has had
   a left sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax
   during this admission.  CXR on arrival shows developing left sided
   infiltrate, likely secondary to recent aspiration event.  No evidence
   of recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Will maintain on
   trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - Appreciate IP and thoracics recommendations
   - Continue atrovent nebulizers standing and PRN
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appears to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  As the patient's blood pressures are borderline, appears
   to be developing septic physiology, likely tachycardia is
   compensatory.
   - Hold additional nodal agents
   - Treat with IV fluid boluses
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKG on arrival shows sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
   Will continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Currently hypotensive, hold all anti-hypertensives.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic with low blood glucose levels. He required immediate resuscitation and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient developed several complications. He had an episode of hypotension requiring vasopressor support, as well as sepsis with positive blood cultures indicating a bacterial infection. The patient also developed C. difficile infection and pneumonia. Imaging studies revealed pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, bilateral pneumonia, and pneumatosis in the descending colon. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated, indicating an ongoing infection.

The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance was also abnormal, with imbalances in sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. His renal function was impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The patient's liver function tests were within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes previous admissions for myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. He has a history of smoking and alcohol use. The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father and mother.

   Agree with plan to continue aggressive treatment for c diff with PO/PR

   appreciated. Will continue vanco IV for line infection, d/c cefepime,
   change to tigecycline.

   hypovolemia as well as med effect (pressors).  Now much improved.
   --He remains stable from a resp standpoint.  Remains on TC.  Has not
   shown signs of fatigue or need to initiate ventilatory support.
   Suspect aspiration pneumonitis rather than new pna with PSA

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated 22-month course following traumatic splenic laceration and surgical splenectomy. He also has a cutaneous fistula, intraabdominal abscess with percutaneous drain, tracheostomy, and recent pleural effusion. The patient was transferred to the MICU with sepsis, likely due to severe C. diff. He has been receiving aggressive IVFs, vasopressin, and norepinephrine. His tachycardia has improved, and he is now on low-dose norepinephrine. The patient's respiratory status remains stable, and he is on tracheostomy collar. There are no signs of fatigue or need for ventilatory support.

The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, hypovolemia, increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents prior to transfer. However, he is improving after aggressive IVFS. His tachycardia was likely due to fevers, inflammatory response, hypovolemia, and medication effects (pressors). Now, it is much improved.

The patient remains stable from a respiratory standpoint and is on tracheostomy collar. He has not shown signs of fatigue or need for ventilatory support.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated 22-month course following traumatic splenic laceration, surgical splenectomy, cutaneous fistula, persistent intraabdominal abscess with percutaneous drain and antibiotic course, tracheostomy, and recent pleural effusion. The patient was transferred to the MICU with sepsis, likely from severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and aspiration pneumonia (ASP PNA). The patient has been improving, but still has several primary issues including fevers, leukocytosis, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, C. diff colitis, and Gram-positive cocci bacteremia (PICC line infection).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents. Close monitoring and aggressive intravenous fluids (IVFs) are required. Vasopressor support may be needed if hypotension persists.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's high heart rate could be a result of fevers, infection, hypovolemia, and medication effects. As the patient improves, the tachycardia should resolve.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be related to respiratory issues, such as aspiration pneumonia or pleural effusion. Continuous monitoring of"

   80M w/ complicated [**1-22**] mo course following traumatic splenic laceration
   with surgical splenectomy, c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-cutaneous fistula, intraabdominal

   recent  pleural effusion s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/b PNX  s/p [**Hospital 1650**] transferred to MICU
   w/ sepsis.  Likely from severe c diff.   Improving from septic
   standpoint with aggressive resuscitation and antbx.
   Agree with plan to continue aggressive treatment for c diff with PO/PR
   vanco and flagyl.  Following serial abd exam.  Surgery and ID input
   appreciated. Will continue vanco IV for line infection, d/c cefepime,
   change to tigecycline.
   --Hypotension appears multifactorial and [**1-21**] sepsis, hypovolemia,
   increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents prior to transfer.
   Improving after aggressive IVFS.  Will wean pressors. Lactate has
   normalized and he is making good urine output.
   --His tachycardia was likely  from fevers, inflammatory response, and
   hypovolemia as well as med effect (pressors).  Now much improved.
   --He remains stable from a resp standpoint.  Remains on TC.  Has not
   shown signs of fatigue or need to initiate ventilatory support.
   Suspect aspiration pneumonitis rather than new pna with PSA
   cololinzation.  Will hold on antbx. Follow O2 sats and clinical status.
   Remainder as outlined in resident note.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:  Will keep NPO at this time given colonic infection.  Will
   probably require TPN bridge, but will hold for now as septic picture
   improves.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated 1.5-month course following traumatic splenic laceration with surgical splenectomy, cutaneous fistula, intraabdominal abscess with percutaneous drain, antibx course, tracheostomy, and recent pleural effusion. He was transferred to the MICU with sepsis, likely from severe C. diff. The patient has shown improvement from a septic standpoint with aggressive resuscitation and antibiotics.

The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, including sepsis, hypovolemia, increased tachycardia, and pharmacological agents prior to transfer. However, after aggressive IVFS, the patient's condition has improved, and the pressors are being weaned.

The patient's tachycardia was likely due to fevers, inflammatory response, hypovolemia, and medication effects (pressors). Now, the patient's tachycardia has significantly improved.

The patient remains stable from a respiratory standpoint and is on tracheostomy. There are no signs of fatigue or need for ventilatory support. The patient is suspected of having aspiration pneumonitis rather than new pneumonia with PSA colonization. Antibiotics have been held for now, with close monitoring of O2 sats and clinical status.

Other findings include:
- The patient has a history of allergies to Ambien and codeine.
- Recent blood cultures showed C. diff"

   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous
   fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, with pressors weaned off.
   - patient off pressors, maintaining MAP > 65.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO, and PR, flagyl (day 3) and tigecycline
   (day 2) for supplemental c diff treatment
   - Tigecycline also covers for coag negative staph in blood
   - added on sensitivities from sputum Cx to colistin (this would be only
   treatment of pseudomonas pna)
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - resent sputum
   - will not treat pseudomonas in sputum unless clinically deteriorates
   given side effect profile of colistin
   .
   # LLQ abdominal pain: Could be secondary to known C diff infection, or
   reaccumulation of prior fluid collection.  Finding of pneumatosis on CT
   scan concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.
   - Surgery following, recs appreciated
   - Per surgery, will hold off on repeat CT for now because of improved
   exam
   - will likely do repeat CT within the next few days to evaluate for
   reaccumulation of abdominal fluid collection
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved initially with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   but has now resume.  Most likely cause of tachycardia is discomfort and
   dyspnea given cough and increased secretions.  Another possibility
   would be PE, but patient has been on DVT ppx since admission.
   - gentle diuresis today to improve dypnea
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT, nebs
   - would consider imaging to eval for PE if persists
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, CXR shows LLL pna.  The patient has had
   a left sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax
   during this admission.  CXR on arrival shows developing left sided
   infiltrate, likely secondary to recent aspiration event.  No evidence
   of recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Will maintain on
   trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - gentle diuresis with goal 500cc neg today
   - repeat sputum Cx
   - daily CXR
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT and standing nebs
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKG on arrival shows sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
   Will continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Currently hypotensive, hold all anti-hypertensives.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including splenic bleed, abscess, splenectomy, colo-cutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion, and fever. The patient was transferred from the floor for fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, including pneumonia and intra-abdominal abscesses. The patient is currently on fluid resuscitation and has had pressors weaned off. The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection and has received antibiotics to cover coag-negative staphylococci in the blood. The patient's tachycardia is thought to be secondary to discomfort, dyspnea, or possible PE. Hypoxia is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's abdominal pain may be related to C. difficile or reaccumulation of fluid collection. The patient's lines and tubes are being managed, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP is being provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, and C. difficile infection. There is a risk of worsening sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with ongoing hypoxia"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous
   fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, with pressors weaned off.
   - patient off pressors, maintaining MAP > 65.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO, and PR, flagyl (day 3) and tigecycline
   (day 2) for supplemental c diff treatment
   - Tigecycline also covers for coag negative staph in blood
   - added on sensitivities from sputum Cx to colistin (this would be only
   treatment of pseudomonas pna)
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - resent sputum
   - will not treat pseudomonas in sputum unless clinically deteriorates
   given side effect profile of colistin
   .
   # LLQ abdominal pain: Could be secondary to known C diff infection, or
   reaccumulation of prior fluid collection.  Finding of pneumatosis on CT
   scan concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.
   - Surgery following, recs appreciated
   - Per surgery, will hold off on repeat CT for now because of improved
   exam
   - will likely do repeat CT within the next few days to evaluate for
   reaccumulation of abdominal fluid collection
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved initially with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   but has now resume.  Most likely cause of tachycardia is discomfort and
   dyspnea given cough and increased secretions.  Another possibility
   would be PE, but patient has been on DVT ppx since admission.
   - gentle diuresis today to improve dypnea
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT, nebs
   - would consider imaging to eval for PE if persists
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia.  The patient has had a left sided
   diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax during this
   admission.  Additionally imaging shows pulmonary edema.  Will maintain
   on trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - gentle diuresis with goal 500cc neg today
   - repeat sputum Cx
   - daily CXR
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT and standing nebs
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKGs have shown sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.  Will
   continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Hold all anti-hypertensives for now.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history. He was admitted to the ICU due to fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has undergone several procedures, including splenectomy, colocutaneous fistula repair, and chest tube placement. He also has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's current condition is complicated by multiple sources of bacteremia, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, tigecycline, and colistin. The patient's abdominal pain may be related to the C. difficile infection or reaccumulation of fluid collection. His tachycardia is likely due to discomfort and dyspnea, but other possible causes include pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation. The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and tracheobronchomalacia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, including GPCs, pseudomonas, and gram-positive rods. This increases the risk of sepsis, especially if the bacteria spread to other organs.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory failure require close monitoring and intervention. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.

   CXR this AM:
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), including intra-abdominal
   abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing 4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods,
   3+ GPCs), line infection (PICC removed [**2132-12-8**]), pneumonia (witnessed
   aspiration event).  Most obvious source for overwhelming infection
   would be C diff, especially given finding of pneumatosis on CT
   (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous fistula).  Also has
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR with sputum growing pseudomonas.  Now fluid
   resuscitated, with pressors weaned off overnight.
   - patient off pressors, maintaining MAP > 65.
   - Treat empirically with vanc IV, PO, and PR, and flagyl.  Will change
   cefepime to tigecycline today, as it covers broadly and may confer
   additional treatment for c diff. (Vanc IV planned for 1 week, for coag
   neg staph line infection)
   - added on sensitivities from sputum Cx to colistin (this would be only
   treatment of pseudomonas pna)
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - Follow culture data and narrow as indicated
   .
   # LLQ abdominal pain: Could be secondary to known C diff infection, or
   reaccumulation of prior fluid collection.  Finding of pneumatosis on CT
   scan concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.
   - Surgery following, recs appreciated
   - Repeat CT abd/pelvis this am
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, CXR shows LLL pna.  The patient has had
   a left sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax
   during this admission.  CXR on arrival shows developing left sided
   infiltrate, likely secondary to recent aspiration event.  No evidence
   of recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Will maintain on
   trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - Appreciate IP and thoracics recommendations
   - Continue atrovent nebulizers standing and PRN
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved with fluid resuscitation, will continue to
   monitor.
   - prn fluid boluses for tachycardia
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKG on arrival shows sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
   Will continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Currently hypotensive, hold all anti-hypertensives.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a chief complaint of a 24-hour history of tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and altered mental status, suggestive of sepsis. He is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical conditions including electrolyte and fluid disorder, C. difficile infection, and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and altered mental status indicate sepsis. If left untreated or poorly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, organ failure, and even death.

2. C. difficile infection: The presence of fecal material on the groin line suggests a potential C. difficile infection. This infection can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. It can also increase the risk of developing sepsis.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and positive sputum culture indicate pneumonia. If not treated appropriately, pneumonia can worsen and lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.

4. Aspiration: The patient's history of aspiration suggests an increased risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP can lead to worsening lung function and may necessitate prolonged mechanical ventilation.

5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder"

   Imaging:
   CXR this AM:
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), including intra-abdominal
   abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing 4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods,
   3+ GPCs), line infection (PICC removed [**2132-12-8**]), pneumonia (witnessed
   aspiration event).  Most obvious source for overwhelming infection
   would be C diff, especially given finding of pneumatosis on CT
   (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous fistula).  Also has
   bilateral pneumonia on CXR with pneural fluid growing pseudomonas.  Now
   fluid resuscitated, but continues on pressor support.
   - patient off pressors, maintaining MAP > 65.
   - Treat empirically with vanc IV, PO, and PR, and flagyl.  Will change
   cefepime to tigecycline today, as it covers broadly and may confer
   additional treatment for c diff. (Vanc IV planned for 1 week, for coag
   neg staph line infection)
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - Follow culture data and narrow as indicated
   .
   # LLQ abdominal pain: Could be secondary to known C diff infection, or
   reaccumulation of prior fluid collection.  Finding of pneumatosis on CT
   scan concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.
   - Surgery following, recs appreciated
   - Repeat CT abd/pelvis this am
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, CXR shows LLL pna.  The patient has had
   a left sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax
   during this admission.  CXR on arrival shows developing left sided
   infiltrate, likely secondary to recent aspiration event.  No evidence
   of recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Will maintain on
   trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - Appreciate IP and thoracics recommendations
   - Continue atrovent nebulizers standing and PRN
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved with fluid resuscitation, will continue to
   monitor.
   - prn fluid boluses for tachycardia
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKG on arrival shows sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.
   Will continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Currently hypotensive, hold all anti-hypertensives.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including splenic bleed, abscess, and removal, as well as a colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess drainage, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion drainage, and chest tube placement. He was admitted to the ICU due to fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia, including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula, line infection, and pneumonia. Most obvious source for overwhelming infection would be Clostridium difficile (C diff), especially given the finding of pneumatosis on CT (although that could be explained by the colocutaneous fistula). Also, he has bilateral pneumonia on CXR with pleural fluid growing Pseudomonas. 

2. LLQ abdominal pain: It could be secondary to known C diff infection or reaccumulation of prior fluid collection. The finding of pneumatosis on CT scan is concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.

3. Hypoxia: It is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia. The CXR shows left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia. The patient had a left-sided diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax during this"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated one-month course following traumatic splenic laceration with surgical splenectomy, cutaneous fistula, intraabdominal abscess with percutaneous drain, tracheostomy, recent pleural effusion status post PNX, and transferred to MICU with sepsis. The patient is improving from a septic standpoint with aggressive resuscitation and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, likely due to severe C. difficile infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a severe C. diff infection, which can cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms and may lead to complications such as toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or sepsis.

3. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple lines and tubes, including a central line, which increases the risk of developing a CLABSI. This infection can spread through the bloodstream and cause sepsis.

4. Pressure injuries: The patient is critically ill and immobile, increasing the risk of developing pressure injuries, particularly in areas where pressure is applied, such as the sacrum or heels.

5. Pneumonia: The patient's recent history of pleural eff"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated one-month course following traumatic splenic laceration with surgical splenectomy, cutaneous fistula, intraabdominal abscess with percutaneous drain, tracheostomy, recent pleural effusion, and subsequent pans pleuralitis. He was transferred to the MICU with sepsis from severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been improving from a septic standpoint with stable blood pressure off pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient remains stable from a respiratory standpoint on tracheal suctioning without change in oxygen requirements. However, he continues to have sputum production and has new right lower lobe atelectasis/opacity on today's chest X-ray. There is known resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) in his sputum. Monitoring I/Os and considering gentle diuresis late in the day with clinical reassessment is recommended. Repeating sputum evaluation is also advised. If there is a change in oxygen requirement, treating for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with colistin should be considered.

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, related to cough, possible component of pulmonary edema, concern for ongoing infection, although he is"

   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous
   fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, with pressors weaned off.
   - patient off pressors, maintaining MAP > 65.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO, and PR, flagyl (day 3) and tigecycline
   (day 2) for supplemental c diff treatment
   - Tigecycline also covers for coag negative staph in blood
   - added on sensitivities from sputum Cx to colistin (this would be only
   treatment of pseudomonas pna)
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - resent sputum
   - will not treat pseudomonas in sputum unless clinically deteriorates
   given side effect profile of colistin
   .
   # LLQ abdominal pain: Could be secondary to known C diff infection, or
   reaccumulation of prior fluid collection.  Finding of pneumatosis on CT
   scan concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.
   - Surgery following, recs appreciated
   - Per surgery, will hold off on repeat CT for now because of improved
   exam
   - will likely do repeat CT within the next few days to evaluate for
   reaccumulation of abdominal fluid collection
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved initially with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   but has now resume.  Most likely cause of tachycardia is discomfort and
   dyspnea given cough and increased secretions.  Another possibility
   would be PE, but patient has been on DVT ppx since admission.
   - gentle diuresis today to improve dypnea
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT, nebs
   - would consider imaging to eval for PE if persists
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia.  The patient has had a left sided
   diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax during this
   admission.  Additionally imaging shows pulmonary edema.  Will maintain
   on trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - gentle diuresis with goal 500cc neg today
   - repeat sputum Cx
   - daily CXR
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT and standing nebs
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKGs have shown sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.  Will
   continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Hold all anti-hypertensives for now.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including a splenic bleed, splenectomy, colo-cutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. He was admitted to the ICU for fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, including GPCs, pneumonia, and intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula. He also has C. difficile infection, which has been treated with vancomycin, Flagyl, and tigecycline. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing sepsis, pneumonia, and potential complications such as ischemic colitis and pulmonary embolism. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple IV lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing infection and sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not adequately controlled.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as cough and increased secretions, suggest a possible pneumonia. This can worsen his hypoxia and require more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Ischemic colitis: The presence of pneumatosis on CT scan raises concern for ischemic colitis, which could lead to further abdominal pain and potential perforation.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's tach"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous
   fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, with pressors weaned off.
   - patient off pressors, maintaining MAP > 65.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO, and PR, flagyl (day 3) and tigecycline
   (day 2) for supplemental c diff treatment
   - Tigecycline also covers for coag negative staph in blood
   - added on sensitivities from sputum Cx to colistin (this would be only
   treatment of pseudomonas pna)
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - resent sputum
   - will not treat pseudomonas in sputum unless clinically deteriorates
   given side effect profile of colistin
   .
   # LLQ abdominal pain: Could be secondary to known C diff infection, or
   reaccumulation of prior fluid collection.  Finding of pneumatosis on CT
   scan concerning for ischemic colitis, but lactate has remained low.
   - Surgery following, recs appreciated
   - Per surgery, will hold off on repeat CT for now because of improved
   exam
   - will likely do repeat CT within the next few days to evaluate for
   reaccumulation of abdominal fluid collection
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved initially with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   but has now resume.  Most likely cause of tachycardia is discomfort and
   dyspnea given cough and increased secretions.  Another possibility
   would be PE, but patient has been on DVT ppx since admission.
   - gentle diuresis today to improve dypnea
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT, nebs
   - would consider imaging to eval for PE if persists
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia.  The patient has had a left sided
   diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax during this
   admission.  Additionally imaging shows pulmonary edema.  Will maintain
   on trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - gentle diuresis with goal 500cc neg today
   - repeat sputum Cx
   - daily CXR
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT and standing nebs
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKGs have shown sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.  Will
   continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Hold all anti-hypertensives for now.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history. He was admitted to the ICU due to fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, including pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula, and Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. He is being treated with vancomycin, Flagyl, and tigecycline for C diff. Tigecycline also covers coag-negative staph in the blood. Colistin sensitivity from sputum culture is pending. The patient's condition remains unstable with potential medical complications such as electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, C diff infection, and pneumonia. Further evaluation and management are needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is off, with a total input of 1,956 mL and output of 1,660 mL. His sodium levels are slightly low at 125 mEq/L, and potassium levels are on the higher side at 5.5 mEq/L. These imbalances need to be monitored and corrected as necessary.
2. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has signs of ongoing infection with multiple sources, including pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula, and C diff infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of splenic laceration, resulting in a possible splenic abscess and colocutaneous fistula. He has been admitted to the ICU for severe C. difficile sepsis. The patient's current conditions include electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, C. difficile infection, and pneumonia due to aspiration. He is being treated with medications such as tigecycline, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased urine output. He requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy and is receiving fluids and vasopressors for hemodynamic support. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactic acid levels. Imaging shows a decreased right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Microbiology reports indicate positive C. difficile toxin and pseudomonas in sputum cultures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis appears to be improving, but there is still a risk of complications associated with sepsis, such as organ dysfunction, hypotension, and infection spread.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires ongoing support and monitoring. If not managed properly, it can lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ failure.
3. C. difficile infection"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of splenic lac and consequent splenic abscess, as well as a colocutaneous fistula. He has been hospitalized for severe Cdiff sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is sepsis/Cdiff. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/65 mmHg to 135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a tracheal mask. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range. Other lab results indicate slightly low potassium and calcium levels, as well as elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows a right middle lobe infiltrate that appears decreased. Microbiology tests indicate positive Cdiff infection and pseudomonas sputum culture.

The patient's assessment includes electrolyte and fluid disorder, sepsis without organ dysfunction, C. difficile infection, and pneumonia. The plan includes ongoing management of sepsis with antibiotics, support for blood pressure, and consideration for advancing the patient's diet. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, progression of C. difficile infection resulting in severe colitis, and further"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could be explained by  colocutaneous
   fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, now off of pressors and looking well.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO, and PR, flagyl (day 4) and tigecycline
   (day 3) for supplemental c diff treatment
   - Tigecycline also covers for coag negative staph in blood
   - sputum cx sensitivities to colistin pending, would only be used to
   treat pseudomonas if patient were to deteriorate significantly.
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - f/u pending cultures.
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia.  The patient has had a left sided
   diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax during this
   admission.  Additionally imaging shows pulmonary edema.  Will maintain
   on trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - repeat sputum Cx
   - daily CXR
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT and standing nebs
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved initially with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   but has now resumed.  Most likely cause of tachycardia is discomfort
   and dyspnea given cough and increased secretions.  Another possibility
   would be PE, but patient has been on DVT ppx since admission.
   - gentle diuresis today to improve dypnea
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT, nebs
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKGs have shown sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.  Will
   continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Hold all anti-hypertensives for now.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, will discuss tube feeds versus tpn with surgery
   again today after getting KUB.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including a splenic bleed, splenectomy, colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess drainage, respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion with pneumothorax. The patient was admitted to the ICU for fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder
- Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction
- C. Difficile Infection
- Pneumonia, Aspiration

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels. These imbalances can lead to symptoms such as weakness, confusion, irregular heartbeat, and muscle cramps.

2. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, including GPCs in blood, pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas), intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing 4+ GNR, 4+ gram pos rods), and C. difficile. Sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.

3. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile, which can cause severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and can increase the risk of developing se"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   80 yo male with complicated medical course over the past 3 months
   initially secondary to splenic bleed, c/b splenic abscess, splenectomy,
   colocutaneous fistula, intra-abdominal abscess s/p drainage,
   respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis c/b pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement, transferred
   from the floor for fever, tachycardia and hypoxia.
   .
   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could also be explained by
   colocutaneous fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, now off of pressors and
   looking well.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO, flagyl (day 4) and tigecycline (day 3) for
   supplemental c diff treatment; discontinued PR vanc because patient
   wouldn
t tolerate
   - Tigecycline also covers for coag negative staph in blood
   - sputum cx sensitivities to colistin pending, would only be used to
   treat pseudomonas if patient were to deteriorate significantly.
   - ID following, recs appreciated
   - f/u pending cultures.
   .
   #.  Hypoxia:  Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in setting of
   COPD and tracheobronchomalacia.  The patient has had a left sided
   diagnostic thoracentesis with subsequent pneumothorax during this
   admission.  Additionally imaging shows pulmonary edema.  Will maintain
   on trach mask and wean as tolerated.  Will do aggressive suctioning as
   needed.
   - repeat sputum Cx pending
   - daily CXR
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT and standing nebs
   - f/u pending sputum cultures
   .
   #.  Tachycardia:  The patient was thought to be in atrial fibrillation
   on the floor, s/p multiple boluses of nodal agents including metoprolol
   and diltiazem.  EKG on arrival appeared to be more likely to be sinus
   tachycardia.  Resolved initially with aggressive fluid resuscitation,
   but has now resumed.  Most likely cause of tachycardia is discomfort
   and dyspnea given cough and increased secretions.  Another possibility
   would be PE, but patient has been on DVT ppx since admission.  This
   morning, tachycardia is resolving.
   - gentle diuresis today to improve dypnea only if needed
   - aggressive suctioning, chest PT, nebs
   .
   #.  CAD:  EKGs have shown sinus tachycardia, no ischemic changes.  Will
   continue aspirin, statin and hold metoprolol given hypotension.
   .
   #.  HTN:  Hold all anti-hypertensives for now.
   .
   #.  HLD:  Continue statin.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient had a PICC line placed and underwent a KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) examination, which showed moderate to severe dilation. Surgery decided not to start tube feeds due to this finding. The doctor also does not want to initiate TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) at this time.

- The ID (Infectious Disease) team recommends discontinuing IV flagyl and vancomycin, as there are no signs of PNA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) infection. The patient is passing stool and not retaining PR vancomycin, so the PR dose was discontinued.

- The patient was given albuterol to address respiratory issues.

- Allergies include Ambien (sleep walking) and Codeine (unknown reaction).

- The last doses of antibiotics were administered on [2132-12-13] at 06:00 AM, specifically Metronidazole and Vancomycin.

- The patient is currently on various medications, including Famotidine (Pepcid), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   #.  Fever/Sepsis:  The patient has multiple sources for bacteremia
   (GPCs in blood [**2132-12-7**]), pneumonia (sputum growing pseudomonas,
   including intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula (drain growing
   4+GNR, 4+ gram pos rods, 3+ GPCs), and most obvious source for
   overwhelming infection would be C diff, especially given finding of
   pneumatosis on CT (although that could also be explained by
   colocutaneous fistula). Now fluid resuscitated, now off of pressors and
   looking well.
   - Treat C diff with vanc PO and tigecycline (for supplemental c diff
   treatment); discontinued PR vanc because patient wouldn

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a complicated medical history. He has been admitted to the ICU with multiple sources of bacteremia, including GPCs in the blood, pneumonia with sputum growing pseudomonas, intra-abdominal abscess/colocutaneous fistula with drain growing 4+ GNR and 4+ gram pos rods, and suspected C. difficile infection. The patient's condition is stable, and he is currently being treated for C. difficile with vancomycin orally and tigecycline. The patient's hypoxia is improving, and further investigations are planned to determine the cause of his respiratory symptoms. The patient has a history of CAD and HTN, and appropriate measures are being taken for these conditions. The patient's nutrition is currently NPO, with ongoing discussion regarding tube feeds/TPN with surgery. He is receiving insulin for glycemic control and prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are essential to prevent complications associated with sepsis.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's overall condition suggests possible organ dysfunction due to the disseminated C. difficile infection. Regular assessment of organ function,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of splenic laparotomy, resulting in a splenic abscess that was treated with splenectomy and creation of a colo-colostomy fistula. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and septic shock. The patient has shown improvement, including being taken off pressors and having a decreasing white blood cell count. He is currently receiving oral vancomycin and tegecycline for C. diff colitis. Antibiotic therapy for suspected Pseudomonas colonization is being withheld. The patient is awaiting nutrition consult and has been cleared by surgery for enteral feeds. He is receiving ICU care, including glycemic control, arterial line, PICC line, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and he is being transferred to telemetry.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas infection: The patient's sputum culture showed growth of Pseudomonas, indicating potential colonization. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to a Pseudomonas infection.
2. Recurrence of C. diff infection: Although the patient is currently responding well to treatment, there is a risk of recurrence of C. diff infection, which can be serious and may require additional interventions.
3. Line-related infections: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line"
