   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Given history of fever, cough, recent hospital course/rehab
   course, ? of infiltrate on CXR, etiologies include HAP, CAP and viral
   etiologies.  Tachycardia, hypoxia and recent immobilization concerning
   for possible PE.  ACS less likely given lack of EKG changes and lack of
   chest pain, although pt is an elderly female and a diabetic.
   - given vanc, levaquin in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] switch to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage
   - increase WOB and tachypnea, large A-a gradient on ABG -> may need
   intubation this AM
   - gentle diuresis
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - sputum cxs, f/u blood cxs
   - 1st set of CEs neg, continue to trend
   - check BNP in AM

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. The patient presents with cough, fever, and hypoxia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has a history of fever, cough, recent hospitalization, and possible infiltrate on chest X-ray.
2. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms of cough and fever could also indicate a community-acquired infection.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has tachycardia, hypoxia, and recent immobilization, which are concerning for possible PE.
4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Although ACS is less likely given the lack of EKG changes and chest pain, the patient is an elderly female with diabetes, making her at higher risk.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine analysis, indicating a possible UTI.
6. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's risk factors and symptoms, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia.

Please note that this is just a summary of the information provided and does not guarantee the presence of these complications. It is important for the patient's healthcare team to assess and monitor the patient closely for any signs or symptoms of these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presents with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as well as concerns for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Assessment and Plan:
- Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is being managed with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause, which may include HAP, CAP, or viral etiologies.
- Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to a combination of factors such as recent immobilization and possible PE.
- Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS): ACS is less likely given the lack of EKG changes and absence of chest pain.
- CHF: The patient's symptoms appear to be more indicative of congestive heart failure (CHF), particularly in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
- Antibiotic therapy: Initial antibiotics were given in the emergency department but were subsequently stopped due to the lack of fever and white blood cell count.
- Diuresis: The patient is undergoing diuresis with intravenous Lasix to address fluid overload and potential pulmonary edema.
- Rate control of AF: Diltiazem is being used"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), diltiazem, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation. It is important to monitor his heart rhythm and ensure adequate rate control. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent thromboembolic events.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is required. Antibiotic therapy should be continued as prescribed.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient also has a urinary tract infection. Regular assessment of urinary symptoms and urinalysis is necessary. Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be administered.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid intake and has a negative fluid balance of 994 mL since midnight. Careful monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and was previously treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), diltiazem for rate control in AFIB, furosemide for fluid management, and morphine sulfate for pain relief. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm with AFIB, blood pressure of 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, with fluid intake of 1042 mL and output of 2035 mL over the past 24 hours. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.3 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and slightly elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient's unresponsive state. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and atrial fibrillation"

   Patient continues to be in mild respiratory distress with what is
   probably CHF due to diastolic dysfunction. Patient has pulmonary
   hypertension but recent CT did not show thromboembolic disease nor
   significant parenchymal lung disease (mild emphysema). When she has
   rapid ventricular rate, she appears to decompensate with respect to her
   CHF and respiratory distress. I would suggest stopping digoxin and
   increasing diltiazem. Consider possible amiodarone if diltiazem does
   not control her.
   Antibiotics stopped.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are pneumonia and hypoxemia. The patient is febrile and has intermittent rapid ventricular response with atrial fibrillation. Lasix and diltiazem have been given to manage these conditions.

The patient has shown a negative fluid balance yesterday and cardiac enzymes are negative. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications have been documented.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of mild respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 124 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, total intake of 1,042 mL, and total output of 2,035 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -994 mL. The respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula with SpO2 of 98% and ABG results showing pH 7.36, PaCO2 56 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 97.

During the physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. No abnormalities were noted in the eyes/conjunctiva, head"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presented with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, hypoxia, and recent immobilization, which are concerning for possible pulmonary embolism. Acute coronary syndrome is less likely due to the absence of EKG changes and chest pain. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin in the emergency department, and then switched to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration coverage. However, there was no white blood cell count elevation and no fever, and the clinical picture appears to be more consistent with congestive heart failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Therefore, all antibiotics were stopped.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, and possible urinary tract infection. The assessment and plan include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of factors such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, viral etiologies, or pulmonary edema. The patient has been given diuretics with the goal of achieving a negative fluid balance of 1-1.5 liters and continuing rate control of atrial fibrillation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presents with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia likely due to a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and atelectasis of the left lung. She has been receiving diuretics, rate control medication for atrial fibrillation, and antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has had episodes of tachycardia and diaphoresis. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal renal function, and elevated troponin T levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to a combination of factors including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and atelectasis of the left lung. Immediate interventions such as aggressive oxygen therapy, bronchoscopic evaluation, and possible intubation may be necessary to improve oxygenation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with occasional rapid ventricular response. Rate control medications have been initiated, but further discussion with the cardiologist is needed regarding potential anticoagulation therapy and possible initiation of amiod"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia, community-acquired (CAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and was admitted to the ICU.

During her stay in the ICU, she experienced episodes of tachypnea and atrial fibrillation, which responded to Lasix and diltiazem. Her PO diltiazem dosage was increased from 30 to 60 mg, then to 90 mg qid over the day. She also received regular insulin at bedtime.

On the following day, she had desaturation associated with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the 120s-130s. She was quickly returned to 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and her saturation levels improved to the high 90s.

A chest X-ray revealed a white-out of the left lung, and an ultrasound probe showed approximately 2 cm of fluid in the left lung. A CT scan confirmed bilateral pleural effusions, left lung collapse, and mediastinal shift towards the left lung, suggesting volume loss rather than just a large effusion.

The patient was started on chest physiotherapy, Mucomyst nebulizer treatment, and is likely to require intubation and bronchoscopy tomorrow.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 74"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presented with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with a likely combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and left lung atelectasis. She has been receiving diuretics, rate control medication for atrial fibrillation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's current condition of hypoxia is due to a combination of factors including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and left lung atelectasis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which may lead to further complications such as heart failure or stroke if not properly managed.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or treatment failure if the antibiotics are not appropriate.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia due to her inability to protect her airway.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), who presented to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible sepsis. Upon admission, the patient was in respiratory distress and required immediate intervention. She was started on high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula and given Lasix to manage her AF and tachypnea.

Over the course of the day, the patient's condition fluctuated. She experienced desaturation events associated with episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), reaching heart rates in the 120s-130s. These episodes were quickly managed with increased doses of diltiazem and the use of a 5L NC.

A chest X-ray revealed a white-out of the left lung, indicating potential collapse or consolidation. An ultrasound probe showed approximately 2 cm of fluid in the left lung, which was further evaluated by a CT scan. The CT scan confirmed bilateral pleural effusions, left lung collapse, and a mediastinal shift towards the left lung, suggesting volume loss rather than just a large effusion. 

The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range, blood pressure within acceptable limits, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation ranging from 95% to 100%. Her heart rhythm has remained in AF with occasional RVR.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress, congestive heart failure (CHF), atelectasis, and anemia. The patient has been experiencing episodes of tachycardia, one of which was associated with left lung atelectasis. They have been diuresed and continue to have negative fluid balance. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require supplemental oxygen. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese build, normal heart sounds, and clear breath sounds on the right side with crackles and bronchial breath sounds on the left side. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows opacification of the left hemithorax with visible air bronchogram, suggesting pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib), pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), atelectasis, and chronic diastolic CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged atelectasis: The patient's left lung remains atelectatic despite interventions such as ambulation and potential bronchoscopic clearance. If not addressed, this could lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Worsening CHF: The patient's chronic diastolic CHF may worsen if fluid balance is not maintained or if there is inadequate treatment of the underlying cause.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He had been experiencing shortness of breath, cough, and fever for the past week. On admission, he was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has shown improvement. He was extubated in the morning after clearing copious secretions from his left main bronchus. The repeat chest X-ray showed improved atelectasis compared to the previous day. He remained on the ventilator overnight for additional recruitment and was extubated in the morning.

The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion for sedation, furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management, midazolam (Versed) for procedural sedation, and fentanyl for pain control. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 to 134/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. He is still experiencing atrial fibrillation but has been monitored closely.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,346 mL and a total output of 733 mL, resulting in a negative balance of "

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**].  Goal to extubate this AM (intubated for bronch yesterday)
   pending family discussion.
   - cont rate control of afib with dilt 90mg QID
   - had bronch yesterday with removal of copious secretions, L lung
   atelectasis improved
   - aggressive IS
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
   - RSBI this AM 90
   - will talk to family regarding goals of care (re: possibility of
   reintubation)
   - extubate pending family disucssion
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control on diltiazem 90mg
   QID.
   - cont dilt 90mg QID
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] her cardiologist whether or not digoxin
   should  be stopped and possibly amio should be started for better afib
   control
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative
   .
   # CAD: Chest pain free, but pt is an elderly, diabetic female.
   - ruled out for MI with three neg sets of CK/troponins on presentation
   - CEs [**2-6**] given acute episode of diaphoresis, tachycardia were negative
   - cont statin, digoxin
   .
   # DM: Will hold metformin and glyburide.  Monitor FSBS and place on
   SSI.
   .
   # Anemia
 prior Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   will guaiac stools.  Hct down to 24.5.
   .
   # Persistent Hypercarbia on ABGs
 unclear etiology, likely underlying
   lung disease
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. Upon admission, the patient was found to have pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a heart rate ranging from 77 to 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 to 134/58 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation in CPAP mode with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and increased sputum production, should be done.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. The patient should be assessed for any signs of swelling or pain"

   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**]
   - diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix with goal of neg 1-1.5L
   - cont rate control of afib with dilt 90mg QID
   - had bronch yesterday with removal of copious secretions, L lung
   atelectasis improved
   - aggressive IS
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
   - extubate this AM
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control on diltiazem 90mg
   QID.
   - cont dilt 90mg QID
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] her cardiologist whether or not digoxin
   should  be stopped and possibly amio should be started for better afib
   control
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative
   .
   # CAD: Chest pain free, but pt is an elderly, diabetic female.
   - ruled out for MI with three neg sets of CK/troponins on presentation
   - CEs [**2-6**] given acute episode of diaphoresis, tachycardia were negative
   - cont statin, digoxin
   .
   # DM: Will hold metformin and glyburide.  Monitor FSBS and place on
   SSI.
   .
   # Anemia
 prior Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   will guaiac stools.  Hct down to 24.5.
   .
   # Persistent Hypercarbia on ABGs
 unclear etiology, likely underlying
   lung disease

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presented with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/52 mmHg to 134/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been intubated due to bronchospasm with clearance of copious secretions from the left main bronchus. She was placed on mechanical ventilation and remained on ventilatory support overnight for additional recruitment. The repeat chest X-ray showed improved atelectasis. The patient was extubated in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which could be due to a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), volume overload, and thick airway secretions causing atelectasis of the left lung. The atelectasis has improved after bronchospasm with removal of secretions.
2. Infection: The patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) despite being asymptomatic. This could be due to her poor historian status and recent treatment for a gram-positive UTI. The urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**].  Goal to extubate this AM (intubated for bronch yesterday)
   pending family discussion.
   - cont rate control of afib with dilt 90mg QID
   - had bronch yesterday with removal of copious secretions, L lung
   atelectasis improved
   - aggressive IS
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
   - RSBI this AM 90
   - will talk to family regarding goals of care (re: possibility of
   reintubation)
   - extubate pending family disucssion
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control on diltiazem 90mg
   QID.
   - cont dilt 90mg QID
   - will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] her cardiologist whether or not digoxin
   should  be stopped and possibly amio should be started for better afib
   control
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative
   .
   # CAD: Chest pain free, but pt is an elderly, diabetic female.
   - ruled out for MI with three neg sets of CK/troponins on presentation
   - CEs [**2-6**] given acute episode of diaphoresis, tachycardia were negative
   - cont statin, digoxin
   .
   # DM: Will hold metformin and glyburide.  Monitor FSBS and place on
   SSI.
   .
   # Anemia
 prior Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   will guaiac stools.  Hct down to 24.5.
   .
   # Persistent Hypercarbia on ABGs
 unclear etiology, likely underlying
   lung disease

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. The patient presents with dyspnea, cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient is currently intubated for bronchospasm and being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration.

24-hour events:
- Extubation postponed until family meeting and code status discussed
- Placed OG tube
- Given NS 500cc x3 for poor urine output
- Switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed due to mild hypotension

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and thick airway secretions causing atelectasis of the left lung.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation but obtained better control on diltiazem 90mg QID.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine analysis indicating a UTI. However, the patient is asymptomatic, and urine culture is negative.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient is an elderly diabetic female with chest pain-free but requires monitoring for myocardial infarction.
5. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's diabetes medications (metformin and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - intubated after bronch on [**2-6**] to evaluate L lung collapse, has high
   RISBIs and was not extubated yesterday.  Is doing well on PS and plan
   for extubation today.
   - has persistent LLL atelectasis on CXR today
   - sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed after transient
   hypotension and low UO yesterday evening
   - continue rate control to avoid pulm edema, decreasing dilt today form
   90 to 60 because of transient hypotension
   - holding lasix today, will reevaluate fluid status in AM
   - aggressive IS when extubated
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
 all preliminarily negative so far
   - will talk to family regarding goals of care (re: possibility of
   reintubation)
   - extubate pending family discussion
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**].
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control on diltiazem 90mg
   QID.
   - decreasing dilt from 90 mg qid to 60 mg qid per above
   - do not know who cardiologist is, can consider switching dig to amio
   - checking dig level today to make sure no dig toxicity
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presented with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient was intubated after experiencing left lung collapse and had high respiratory intensity index. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 309 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/43 mmHg to 147/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has atrial fibrillation with an irregular rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and hypoxia, along with the presence of thick airway secretions and atelectasis, increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

","The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea. The patient's condition is complex and includes several medical complications.

1. Pneumonia (Bacterial Community Acquired - CAP): The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a bacterial infection of the lungs. This condition can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and administer appropriate antibiotics.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient also has a urinary tract infection. This infection can cause symptoms such as frequent urination, pain or burning during urination, and urgency. It is crucial to manage the infection with appropriate antibiotics and ensure adequate hydration.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular heartbeats. AFib increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. Monitoring the patient's heart rate and rhythm, as well as administering appropriate medications, is essential.

4. Respiratory Support: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (CPAP/PSV mode) with a FiO2 of 40%. This indicates that the patient requires assistance with breathing. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and respiratory effort is necessary.

5. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total input of 2,256 mL and output of 1,790"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - intubated after bronch on [**2-6**] to evaluate L lung collapse, extubated
   yesterday
   - continue rate control to avoid pulm edema
   - aggressive IS
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
 all negative so far
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**].
   - S&S eval today for aspiration [**Last Name (un) 4035**]
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control initially on
   diltiazem 90mg QID.
   - switched to diltiazem 60mg QID yesterday for hypotension -> stable
   overnight
   - last dig level non-toxic
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative
   .
   # CAD: Chest pain free, but pt is an elderly, diabetic female.
   - ruled out for MI with three neg sets of CK/troponins on presentation
   - CEs [**2-6**] given acute episode of diaphoresis, tachycardia were negative
   - cont statin, digoxin
   .
   # DM: Will hold metformin and glyburide.  Monitor FSBS and place on
   SSI.
   .
   # Anemia
 prior Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   will guaiac stools.  Hct 25 today, stable.
   .
   # Persistent Hypercarbia on ABGs
 unclear etiology, likely underlying
   lung disease
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI, son is HCP

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She presents with cough, fever, and hypoxia. The patient was intubated after experiencing a left lung collapse and was extubated yesterday.

The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications that could arise. These include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and thick airway secretions causing atelectasis of the left lung. The patient was intubated to evaluate the left lung collapse and was extubated yesterday.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF and has better control with diltiazem. The blood pressure was stable overnight, and the last digoxin level was non-toxic.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although the patient is asymptomatic, she has a history of recent gram-positive UTI treatment with ciprofloxacin and now has a positive urine analysis. However, the urine culture is negative.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient is chest pain-free, but she is an elderly diabetic female. She has been ruled out for myocardial infarction with three negative sets of CK/troponins"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, bacterial pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been extubated and is on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 142/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,316 mL and output of 1,905 mL with a positive balance of 411 mL. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal range. The patient's medical team made a decision to honor the patient's do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI) orders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which led to his admission to the ICU. Although the patient has been extubated and is on CPAP/PSV ventilation, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of further complications such as sepsis or acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - intubated after bronch on [**2-6**] to evaluate L lung collapse, extubated
   yesterday. - has persistent LLL atelectasis on CXR today
   - continue rate control to avoid pulm edema
   - aggressive IS
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
 all negative so far
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**].
   - DNR/DNI per family
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control initially on
   diltiazem 90mg QID.
   - switched to diltiazem 60mg QID yesterday for hypotension -> stable
   overnight
   - do not know who cardiologist is, can consider switching dig to amio
   - checking dig level today to make sure no dig toxicity
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative
   .
   # CAD: Chest pain free, but pt is an elderly, diabetic female.
   - ruled out for MI with three neg sets of CK/troponins on presentation
   - CEs [**2-6**] given acute episode of diaphoresis, tachycardia were negative
   - cont statin, digoxin
   .
   # DM: Will hold metformin and glyburide.  Monitor FSBS and place on
   SSI.
   .
   # Anemia
 prior Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   will guaiac stools.  Hct 25 today, stable.
   .
   # Persistent Hypercarbia on ABGs
 unclear etiology, likely underlying
   lung disease
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: Full, son is HCP

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with cough, fever, and hypoxia, which led to her being intubated due to left lung collapse. She has persistent left lower lobe atelectasis on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, volume overload, and thick airway secretions causing atelectasis of the left lung. The patient was intubated after bronchoscopy to evaluate left lung collapse and was extubated yesterday. Despite this, she continues to have persistent left lower lobe atelectasis on CXR today. Rate control should be continued to avoid pulmonary edema, and aggressive infection surveillance is recommended. BAL/sputum cultures should be followed up, as they have been negative so far.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF and obtained much better control initially on diltiazem 90mg QID. However, the dose was reduced to 60mg QID yesterday due to hypotension, which was stable overnight. It is not known who the cardiologist is, so consideration can be given to switching digoxin to amiodar"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84yo F with a history of traumatic SAH ([**12-6**]), AF, CVA
   (99'), CAD who presents with cough, fever and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely combination of AF with RVR, volume overload and thick
   airway secretions causing atelectasis of L lung.
   - intubated after bronch on [**2-6**] to evaluate L lung collapse, extubated
   yesterday. - has persistent LLL atelectasis on CXR today
   - continue rate control to avoid pulm edema
   - aggressive IS
   - f/u BAL/sputum cxs
 all negative so far
   - given vanc, levaquin in ED,  switched to vanc/zosyn for HAP and
   aspiration coverage but had no white count and no fever so stopped all
   abx [**2-4**].
   - DNR/DNI per family
   .
    # AF: Currently in AF, obtained much better control on diltiazem 90mg
   QID.
   - do not know who cardiologist is, can consider switching dig to amio
   - checking dig level today to make sure no dig toxicity
   # UTI: Pt asymptomatic but is poor historian, h/o recent gram+ UTI tx
   with cipro and now with +U/A.
   - urine cx negative
   .
   # CAD: Chest pain free, but pt is an elderly, diabetic female.
   - ruled out for MI with three neg sets of CK/troponins on presentation
   - CEs [**2-6**] given acute episode of diaphoresis, tachycardia were negative
   - cont statin, digoxin
   .
   # DM: Will hold metformin and glyburide.  Monitor FSBS and place on
   SSI.
   .
   # Anemia
 prior Fe studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
   will guaiac stools.  Hct 25 today, stable.
   .
   # Persistent Hypercarbia on ABGs
 unclear etiology, likely underlying
   lung disease
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen, subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # Code: Full, son is HCP
   .
   # Communication: Patient and son.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted with cough, fever, and hypoxia. She required intubation due to left lung collapse but has since been extubated. She continues to have persistent left lower lobe atelectasis as seen on chest X-ray. The patient is being managed with rate control to avoid pulmonary edema, aggressive infection prevention strategies, and follow-up with bronchoalveolar lavage/sputum cultures. Antibiotics were initially started for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration coverage but were stopped due to negative results. The patient has made a DNR/DNI decision per family request.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ventilation or need for re-intubation due to persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.
2. Development of hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia due to the patient's compromised respiratory status.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias or digoxin toxicity while managing her atrial fibrillation.
4. Poor glycemic control due to her diabetes mellitus.
5. Further complications related to her chronic anemia of chronic disease.
6. Potential electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing fluid management.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis or stress ulcer bleeding due to prophylactic measures."
