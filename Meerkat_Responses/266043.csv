   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of CKD and BPH who presents
   from ERCP following sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis complicated
   by GI bleed at sphincterotomy site.
   .
   Plan:
   # Choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP complicated by sphincterotomy bleed:
   Patient initially had drop from 36-->31. S/p 2U this morning, patient
   is having small amount of maroon stools and hct has only increased to
   26.5. Per ERCP, maroon stool is likely old blood and [**3-6**] procedure.
   This should decrease however if it increases in volume or becomes
   bright red, they will intervene. LFTs, AP have trended down which is
   promising however pancreatic enzymes have remained stable.
   - follow hct Q6H x 4 and transfuse if HCt drops <28
   - contact ERCP and follow recs
   - continue cipro/flagyl
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, LFTs/[**Doctor First Name 293**]/Lipase, lactate
   - morphine IV, zofran prn for pain/nausea control
   - NPO for now
   -IV D5
 NS maintenance, bolus prn
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Failure stage III: At baseline of 1.5. Continue fluids
   to provide for good UOP.
   - continue to monitor, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Has low baseline dating back to [**2103**] in low 130s.
   This is likely a chronic issue and may be due to chronic kidney
   disease,? etoh/tobacco use in the past. However would benefit from
   medication overview to ensure none of his home meds are causing this.
   -          follow CBC
   -          -avoid medications that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia if
   possible
   .
   # Anemia, [**3-6**] acute blood loss: Baseline of HCT 42. Currently
   transfusing for hct >28.
   - continue to monitor Q6H in setting of sphincterotomy bleed and maroon
   stools
   - transfusion threshold as above
   .
   # BPH: Continue on outpatient regimen of finasteride, doxazosin
   .
   # FEN:  NPO per GI, IV D5
 NS, monitor and replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: 2 PIV
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, hold on bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU care for now until HD stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented from ERCP following sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis, which was complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed at the sphincterotomy site. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells this morning but is still experiencing small amounts of maroon stool. His hemoglobin level has only increased to 26.5. The plan includes monitoring the hemoglobin concentration every 6 hours and transfusing if it drops below 28. It is recommended to contact the ERCP and follow their recommendations. The patient is currently on ciprofloxacin and flagyl, and his WBC count, fever curve, liver function tests, lipase, lactate, and pain/nausea control with morphine and zofran will be trended. The patient is NPO for now and receiving IV D5NS maintenance with bolus as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding from the sphincterotomy site, leading to further decrease in hemoglobin levels and potential hypotension.
2. Infection due to prolonged use of urinary catheter or other invasive lines.
3. Respiratory complications due to immobility and bed rest.
4. Development of renal failure due to inadequate fluid management or nephrotoxic medication use.
5. Thrombocytopenia may worsen if the patient is exposed to any additional factors that affect platelet count.
6. Anemia may persist if the patient continues to experience blood loss.
7. Possible complications related to the chronic kidney disease and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
8. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if the patient requires mechanical ventilation.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters."

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He presented from ERCP following sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis, which was complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed at the sphincterotomy site. The patient experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 36 to 31 and had visible bleeding during repeat ERCP. Hemostasis was achieved, and a stent was placed.

The patient has several medical conditions, including stage III CKD with a baseline creatinine level of 1.5, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and anemia due to acute blood loss with a baseline hematocrit (HCT) of 42. He also has BPH and is currently on outpatient treatment with finasteride and doxazosin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100°F (37.8°C), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/41 mmHg to 90/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has mild scleral icterus.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, increased blood glucose level, elevated liver enzymes, and"

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He presented from ERCP following sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed at the sphincterotomy site. The patient initially had a drop in hemoglobin from 36 to 31, and after receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the morning, he is experiencing bloody brown rice cereal-like (BRBPR) and his hematocrit (hct) has not increased appropriately. The plan is to call ERCP to evaluate the need to return to the operating room or manage medically. Liver function tests (LFTs), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), and total bilirubin have trended down, which is promising, but pancreatic enzymes have remained stable. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 5.0 K/uL. His vital signs include a temperature of 100°F, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/41 mmHg to 90/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of CKD and BPH who presents
   from ERCP following sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis complicated
   by GI bleed at sphincterotomy site.
   .
   Plan:
   # Choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP complicated by sphincterotomy bleed:
   Patient initially had drop from 36-->31. After 1U PRBC hct increased to
   29 and has remained stable. His bilirubin has been decreasing steadily
   and has not had any abdominal pain on exam. He now has resolution of
   maroon stools.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **] transfuse if HCt drops <28
   - follow ERCP recs
   - continue cipro/flagyl
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve, LFTs/[**Doctor First Name 293**]/Lipase, lactate
   - NPO for now, pending ok by ERCP to advance to clears
   - IV bolus prn
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Failure stage III: At baseline of 1.5. Continue fluids
   to provide for good UOP.
   - continue to monitor, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Has low baseline dating back to [**2103**] in low 130s.
   This is likely a chronic issue and may be due to chronic kidney
   disease,? etoh/tobacco use in the past. However would benefit from
   medication overview to ensure none of his home meds are causing this.
   -follow CBC
   -avoid medications that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia if possible
   .
   # Anemia, [**3-6**] acute blood loss: Baseline of HCT 42. Currently
   transfusing for hct >28.

   - continue to monitor hct [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse as above
   - once stable consider follow-up labs for anemia to evaluate if any
   underlying cause (iron deficiency, B12 def, etc)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He was admitted for choledocholithiasis complicated by a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed at the sphincterotomy site after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and his hematocrit (Hct) level increased from 36 to 29. The bilirubin levels have been decreasing steadily, and he has not experienced any abdominal pain. He also has resolution of maroon stools.

The plan includes monitoring the patient's Hct levels and transfusing if it drops below 28. It is recommended to follow ERCP recommendations, continue antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole), trend white blood cell count, fever curve, liver function tests (LFTs), lipase, and lactate. The patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, pending approval from ERCP to advance to clear liquids. IV bolus prn (as needed) should be given.

Other issues noted in the progress note include chronic kidney failure stage III, thrombocytopenia, anemia, BPH, and femoral nerve injury (FEN). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not"

","Summary:
The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has received blood transfusions and antibiotics in the past 24 hours. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/63 mmHg to 142/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is not on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,798 mL and output of 3,020 mL over the past 24 hours. 

Lab results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, glucose, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate). However, the creatinine level is elevated at 1.4 mg/dL, suggesting possible renal impairment. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, and markers of inflammation (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein) are within normal limits. 

The patient has multiple lines in place, including a 20-gauge catheter inserted on 10/19/2106 at 04:44 AM. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after undergoing sphincterotomy for biliary stone extraction. His hemoglobin (HCT) levels have been relatively stable, indicating that the bleeding may be under control. He received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) in the past 24 hours.

Assessment and Plan:
1) GI Bleed - HCT check every 12 hours, continue pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor).
2) Cholelithiasis - Follow-up with the ERCP team. Expect continued decline in liver-associated enzymes. Follow-up management of stent per GI team.
3) Continue ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
4) ICU Care - Consider advancing to a diet per ERCP team. Nutrition: Clears.
5) Glycemic control should be maintained.
6) Lines - 20 Gauge line inserted on [**2106-10-19**] 04:44 AM.
7) Prophylaxis - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Boots. Stress ulcer: Pantoprazole (PPI).
8) Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): None noted.
9) Code status: Do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI).
10) Disposition: Transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Re-bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract"
