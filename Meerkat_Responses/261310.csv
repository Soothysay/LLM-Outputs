   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMHx of COPD on home O2 with recent COPD flare who is being
   transferred back to the ICU for GI bleed and hct drop to 19.
   .
   #GI bleed: Pt with a known h/o PUD, now with acute hct drop, abd pain x
   3 days and black stool.  Suspect upper GI bleed, possible ulcer vs
   ulcerative esophagitis.  Abd exam benign, though amylase/lipase
   elevated, less likely due to pancreatitis. Given resp issues, code
   status and relative hemodynamic stability, will hold off on EGD for now
   per GI. Plan for aggressive resuscitation and trending hct. GI avail
   for scope if pt does not respond appropriately to transfusions.
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now
   - f/u post transfusion hct, consider lasix with 3rd unit
   - place and maintain 2 PIVs
   - NPO with IVF
   - foley in place, monitor i/os
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - GI consulted & following
   - f/u tid hct
   - treating pharyngitis as below
   - Send H pylori
   .
   # Pharyngitis: Pt describing 2-3 days of severe sore throat.  Throat
   culture was positive for HSV and ulcerative lesions visible on
   posterior pharynx c/w HSV pharyngitis.  It is unclear if this tracks
   down esophagus and is the source of bleeding.  Staph likely colonizer.
   - start Valtrex 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] (renally dosed)
   - viscous lidocaine prn
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Trop leak: This was likely due to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypoxia and tachycardia.  EKGs essentially unchanged from prior and pt
   denying any CP.  Aspirin may have worsened PUD and precipitated GI
   bleed.
   - avoid Aspirin given GI bleed
   - hold off on betablockade given volume loss
   - monitor symptomatically for now
   .
   # Dyspnea: Pt initially transferred on [**1-30**] with COPD exacerbation and
   possible flash pulm edema, complicated by demand ischemia and small
   troponin leak.  Hypoxia improving, pt now sating well on home 02.
   Currently on a slow steroid taper.  Crackles on exam likely at
   baseline, neck veins and exam suggest that pt is dry to euvolemic
   - standing Xopenex/ipratrop nebs
   - prednisone 20mg x 1 more day, then prednisone 10mg x 4 days
   - supplemental O2, goal sats in <94%
   - would likely need intubation for EGD, but pt wishes DNI
   - monitor clinically for volume overload
   .
   # HTN: given GI bleed, hold all anti-hypertensives for now
   # FEN: NPO for now with IVF, blood products
   - replete lytes
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV x 1, will attempt to place 2nd u/s guided PIV
   # Code: DNR/DNI *confirmed, form in chart*

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct). The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Vital signs: Temperature is 36.6Â°C, blood pressure is 122/42 mmHg, heart rate is 67 bpm, respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination shows alertness with mild distress, pale appearance, sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, and circular ulcerative lesions on the posterior pharynx with surrounding erythema. The patient's neck is supple, and jugular venous pressure (JVP) is flat with no lymphadenopathy. Bilateral crackles are heard in the lungs. The heart sounds are quiet, with regular rhythm and no murmurs. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding, and no organomegaly is noted. Extremities are warm, with distal pulses palpable, and no edema.
- Lab results show an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.0 K/uL, decreased platelet (Plt) count of 181, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, and elevated glucose level of 152 mg/dL. Other lab values include PT/PTT/INR within normal range, slightly elevated ALT/AST levels, and normal alkalinization/total bilirubin levels.
- The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and is suspected to have an upper GI bleed, possibly due to an ulcer or ulcerative esophagitis. The abdomen is benign, although amylase/lipase levels are elevated, which is less likely due to pancreatitis. Due to respiratory issues, code status, and relative hemodynamic stability, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been postponed.
- The patient has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and will receive further transfusions as needed to maintain hemodynamic stability. Foley catheterization has been performed, and intake/output records are being monitored.
- The patient is nil per os (NPO) with intravenous fluids (IVF) and is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) 40mg IV BID for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Valacyclovir has been started for suspected herpes simplex virus (HSV) pharyngitis.
- Aspirin may have worsened P"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMHx of COPD on home O2 with recent COPD flare who is being
   transferred back to the ICU for GI bleed and hct drop to 19.
   .
   #GI bleed: Pt with a known h/o PUD, now with acute hct drop, abd pain x
   3 days and black stool.  Suspect upper GI bleed, possible ulcer vs
   ulcerative esophagitis.  Abd exam benign, though amylase/lipase
   elevated, less likely due to pancreatitis. Given resp issues, code
   status and relative hemodynamic stability, will hold off on EGD for now
   per GI. Plan for aggressive resuscitation and trending hct. GI avail
   for scope if pt does not respond appropriately to transfusions.
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now
   - f/u post transfusion hct, consider lasix with 3rd unit
   - place and maintain 2 PIVs
   - NPO with IVF
   - foley in place, monitor i/os
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - GI consulted & following
   - f/u tid hct
   - treating pharyngitis as below
   .
   # Pharyngitis: Pt describing 2-3 days of severe sore throat.  Throat
   culture was positive for HSV and ulcerative lesions visible on
   posterior pharynx c/w HSV pharyngitis.  It is unclear if this tracks
   down esophagus and is the source of bleeding.  Staph likely colonizer.
   - start Valtrex 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] (renally dosed)
   - viscous lidocaine prn
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Trop leak: This was likely due to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypoxia and tachycardia.  EKGs essentially unchanged from prior and pt
   denying any CP.  Aspirin may have worsened PUD and precipitated GI
   bleed.
   - avoid Aspirin given GI bleed
   - hold off on betablockade given volume loss
   - monitor symptomatically for now
   .
   # Dyspnea: Pt initially transferred on [**1-30**] with COPD exacerbation and
   possible flash pulm edema, complicated by demand ischemia and small
   troponin leak.  Hypoxia improving, pt now sating well on home 02.
   Currently on a slow steroid taper.  Crackles on exam likely at
   baseline, neck veins and exam suggest that pt is dry to euvolemic
   - standing Xopenex/ipratrop nebs
   - prednisone 20mg x 1 more day, then prednisone 10mg x 4 days
   - supplemental O2, goal sats in <94%
   - would likely need intubation for EGD, but pt wishes DNI
   - monitor clinically for volume overload
   .
   # HTN: given GI bleed, hold all anti-hypertensives for now
   # FEN: NPO for now with IVF, blood products
   - replete lytes
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV x 1, will attempt to place 2nd u/s guided PIV
   # Code: DNR/DNI *confirmed, form in chart*

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 86-year-old male with a medical history of COPD and on home oxygen. He was initially transferred to the ICU for a GI bleed and hct drop to 19. The patient's current chief complaint is severe sore throat, which has been ongoing for 2-3 days. The throat culture revealed a positive result for HSV, indicating HSV pharyngitis. There are also visible ulcerative lesions on the posterior pharynx. It is unclear if this could be the source of the bleeding.

The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being closely monitored for response to transfusion. He is currently on NPO (nothing by mouth) status with IV fluids, and a Foley catheter has been placed to monitor intake and output. Protonix 40mg IV BID has been initiated to manage potential upper GI bleeding.

Other assessments and plans include treatment for dyspnea, a possible flash pulmonary edema, and COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently on a steroid taper and supplemental oxygen, with plans for Xopenex/ipratropium nebs. Intubation for EGD may be required, but the patient wishes to be DNI (do not intubate).

The patient also has a small troponin leak due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia. Aspirin may have worsened PUD (peptic ulcer disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMHx of COPD on home O2 with recent COPD flare who is being
   transferred back to the ICU for GI bleed and hct drop to 19.
   .
   #GI bleed: Pt with a known h/o PUD, now with acute hct drop, abd pain x
   3 days and black stool.  Suspect upper GI bleed, possible ulcer vs
   ulcerative esophagitis.  Abd exam benign, though amylase/lipase
   elevated, less likely due to pancreatitis. Given resp issues, code
   status and relative hemodynamic stability, will hold off on EGD for now
   per GI. Plan for aggressive resuscitation and trending hct, appropriate
   bump after 2 U PRBC, HCT stable.
   - place and maintain 2 PIVs
   - Restart diet today
   - foley in place, monitor i/os
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - GI consulted & following
   - Trend HCT
   - treating pharyngitis as below
   - F/U H pylori
   .
   # Pharyngitis: Pt describing 2-3 days of severe sore throat.  Throat
   culture was positive for HSV and ulcerative lesions visible on
   posterior pharynx c/w HSV pharyngitis.  It is unclear if this tracks
   down esophagus and is the source of bleeding.  Staph likely colonizer.
   - start Valtrex 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] (renally dosed)
   - viscous lidocaine prn
   - Resume diet
   - Continue magic mouthwash
   .
   # Trop leak: This was likely due to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypoxia and tachycardia.  EKGs essentially unchanged from prior and pt
   denying any CP.  Aspirin may have worsened PUD and precipitated GI
   bleed.
   -  Following 3 sets again today for chest pain overnight, first set
   decreased from previous levels, though still elevated
   - avoid Aspirin given GI bleed
   - hold off on betablockade given volume loss
   - monitor symptomatically for now
   .
   # Dyspnea: Pt initially transferred on [**1-30**] with COPD exacerbation and
   possible flash pulm edema, complicated by demand ischemia and small
   troponin leak.  Hypoxia improving, pt now sating well on home 02.
   Currently on a slow steroid taper.  Crackles on exam likely at
   baseline, neck veins and exam suggest that pt is dry to euvolemic
   - standing Xopenex/ipratrop nebs
   - prednisone 20mg x 1 more day, then prednisone 10mg x 4 days
   - supplemental O2, goal sats in <94%
   - would likely need intubation for EGD, but pt wishes DNI
   - monitor clinically for volume overload
   .
   # HTN: given GI bleed, hold all anti-hypertensives for now
   # FEN: Begin dysphagia diet, blood products
   - replete lytes
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, switch to PO PPI
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Code: DNR/DNI *confirmed, form in chart*

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is chest pain that radiated to the back and neck. The patient also has a history of COPD, recent COPD flare, GI bleed, and hct drop to 19. Other significant findings include a positive throat culture for HSV, ulcerative lesions on the posterior pharynx, elevated amylase and lipase levels, and black stool.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to possible peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or ulcerative esophagitis.
2. Pancreatitis, indicated by elevated amylase and lipase levels.
3. Hypoxia due to COPD exacerbation and possible flash pulmonary edema.
4. Troponin leak due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia.
5. Pharyngitis caused by HSV infection, which may require specific antiviral treatment.
6. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance due to aggressive resuscitation and ongoing fluid administration.
7. Potential complications of COPD, such as respiratory failure or exacerbation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, and laboratory values to detect any changes or worsening of these conditions promptly."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a chief complaint of chest pain radiating to the back and neck. The patient's medical history includes acute pancreatitis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis), and no known drug allergies. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/44 mmHg to 159/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been started on magic mouthwash for pain, tolerating soft dysphagia diet, and has stable Hct levels. IV fluids have been administered during the day with good urine output. Amylase and lipase levels have increased, and a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US) is planned for further evaluation. 

EKG did not show any signs of ST changes, and cardiac enzymes were sent to ROMI. The patient's allergies are not documented. Pantoprazole (Protonix) has been administered since the previous day. Other medications include infusions and other ICU medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent chest pain episode. Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and peripheral vascular assessment.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, platelet count, amylase, and lipase levels. Blood glucose levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include acute pancreatitis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the progress note, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac complications due to the chest pain episode."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 F with PMHx of COPD on home O2 with recent COPD flare who is being
   transferred back to the ICU for GI bleed and hct drop to 19.
   .
   #GI bleed: Pt with a known h/o PUD, now with acute hct drop, abd pain x
   3 days and black stool.  Suspect upper GI bleed, possible ulcer vs
   ulcerative esophagitis.  Abd exam benign, though amylase/lipase
   elevated, less likely due to pancreatitis. Given resp issues, code
   status and relative hemodynamic stability, will hold off on EGD for now
   per GI. Plan for aggressive resuscitation and trending hct. GI avail
   for scope if pt does not respond appropriately to transfusions.
   - transfuse 2u prbcs now
   - f/u post transfusion hct, consider lasix with 3rd unit
   - place and maintain 2 PIVs
   - NPO with IVF
   - foley in place, monitor i/os
   - Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - GI consulted & following
   - f/u tid hct
   - treating pharyngitis as below
   - Send H pylori
   .
   # Pharyngitis: Pt describing 2-3 days of severe sore throat.  Throat
   culture was positive for HSV and ulcerative lesions visible on
   posterior pharynx c/w HSV pharyngitis.  It is unclear if this tracks
   down esophagus and is the source of bleeding.  Staph likely colonizer.
   - start Valtrex 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] (renally dosed)
   - viscous lidocaine prn
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Trop leak: This was likely due to demand ischemia in setting of
   hypoxia and tachycardia.  EKGs essentially unchanged from prior and pt
   denying any CP.  Aspirin may have worsened PUD and precipitated GI
   bleed.
   - avoid Aspirin given GI bleed
   - hold off on betablockade given volume loss
   - monitor symptomatically for now
   .
   # Dyspnea: Pt initially transferred on [**1-30**] with COPD exacerbation and
   possible flash pulm edema, complicated by demand ischemia and small
   troponin leak.  Hypoxia improving, pt now sating well on home 02.
   Currently on a slow steroid taper.  Crackles on exam likely at
   baseline, neck veins and exam suggest that pt is dry to euvolemic
   - standing Xopenex/ipratrop nebs
   - prednisone 20mg x 1 more day, then prednisone 10mg x 4 days
   - supplemental O2, goal sats in <94%
   - would likely need intubation for EGD, but pt wishes DNI
   - monitor clinically for volume overload
   .
   # HTN: given GI bleed, hold all anti-hypertensives for now
   # FEN: NPO for now with IVF, blood products
   - replete lytes
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV x 1, will attempt to place 2nd u/s guided PIV
   # Code: DNR/DNI *confirmed, form in chart*

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of COPD and recent exacerbation, who has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding and a drop in hemoglobin level. The patient's symptoms include acute chest pain radiating to the back and neck, as well as severe sore throat with positive throat culture for HSV and visible ulcerative lesions on the posterior pharynx.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and is presenting with black stool and abdominal pain. This suggests the possibility of an acute upper GI bleed, possibly due to an ulcer or ulcerative esophagitis. The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and she has received blood transfusions.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated, indicating a potential diagnosis of pancreatitis. This could be secondary to the patient's recent use of aspirin, which may have worsened PUD and precipitated the GI bleed.

3. Pharyngitis: The patient has severe sore throat and a positive throat culture for HSV, along with visible ulcerative lesions on the posterior pharynx. This suggests HSV pharyngitis, which could be contributing to the patient's dysphagia and potential aspiration risk.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with COPD exacerbation and possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was originally admitted for a COPD flare and readmitted to the MICU for GIB. Her melena has improved and her hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable. The patient experienced an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. She is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and valacyclovir for HSV pharyngitis. Her respiratory status remains stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's initial chief complaint was GIB, and although her melena has improved, she is still at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and ongoing assessment for signs of bleeding or instability is crucial.

2. Chest pain: The patient experienced an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. This could potentially indicate underlying cardiac issues such as myocardial infarction or angina. Continuous monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular system and further evaluation may be necessary to rule out any cardiac complications.

3. COPD exacerbation: The patient was initially admitted for a COPD flare. Although her respiratory status is currently stable, ongoing monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation is important to detect any deterioration or exacerbation of her COPD symptoms.
