   Assessment and Plan
   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior to the VATS procedure and per
   the OSH report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  Apparently he initally did well
   after extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
   It seems possible that he could have had flash pulmonary edema vs
   aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis vs pna that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2.  Unclear etiology of pulmonary
   infiltrates that brought him to [**Hospital 680**] Hospital.  Cx there w/ ngtd
   and apparently he dramatically improved w/ steroids.
   Nature of underlying lung disease not certain
 ddx broad including IPF
   or other ILD, methotrexate toxicity
   - in absence of fever or leukocytosis think pulmonary infection less
   likely, will DC vancomycin and zosyn. Will monitor closely
 usual s/sx
   of infection may be masked in setting of steroids
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday
   - plan to bronch in am if biopsy is non-diagnostic
   - plan to extubate this am
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS
   .
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   Chest tube placed to water seal by thoracics this AM
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult in the am depending on symptoms
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   .
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - re-start coumadin per thorasics

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure for a lingula/LLL biopsy. Post-procedure, she experienced increased work of breathing and hypoxia, leading to reintubation. A chest tube was placed due to drainage of serosanguinous fluid, and there is a small left apical pneumothorax. The patient has a macrocytic anemia of unclear etiology, congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially appeared stable but then developed hypoxia after the VATS procedure. This could be due to flash pulmonary edema, aspiration with resulting pneumonia, or pneumonia causing acute decompensation. It is important to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening respiratory status.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small left apical pneumothorax. Continuous monitoring is necessary to assess if it worsens, and appropriate interventions should be taken if needed.
3. Macrocytic anemia: The cause of the macrocytic anemia is unclear, and further investigations are required to determine the underlying cause. This will help guide appropriate treatment.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient"

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially stable on 3L NC before undergoing a VATS procedure. Post-procedure, he showed improvement but then experienced increased work of breathing and hypoxia, leading to reintubation. His chest X-ray at the time of reintubation showed worsening pulmonary infiltrates compared to the previous X-ray. The patient has a small left apical pneumothorax and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs are stable, but he is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially appeared stable but then developed hypoxia and increased work of breathing, requiring reintubation. There is an ongoing effort to determine the etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small left apical pneumothorax that is unchanged from the previous day's chest X-ray.
3. Infection: Broad coverage for infection is being provided with antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn), considering the patient's recent hospitalization and the presence of NGTD.
4. Rheumatoid arthritis: Methotrexate and Humira have been held temporarily, and a rheumatology consult may be considered depending on the"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior to the VATS procedure and per
   the OSH report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  Apparently he initally did well
   after extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
   It seems possible that he could have had flash pulmonary edema vs
   aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis vs pna that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2.  Unclear etiology of pulmonary
   infiltrates that brought him to [**Hospital 680**] Hospital.  Cx there w/ ngtd
   and apparently he dramatically improved w/ steroids.
   Nature of underlying lung disease not certain
 ddx broad including IPF
   or other ILD, methotrexate toxicity
   - in absence of fever or leukocytosis think pulmonary infection less
   likely, will DC vancomycin and zosyn once culture negative for 48
   hours. Will monitor closely
 usual s/sx of infection may be masked in
   setting of steroids
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday
   - discuss bronch in am if biopsy is non-diagnostic
   - plan to extubate this am if tolerates SBT
   - Has cuff leak this am
   - wean sedation
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS
   .
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   Chest tube placed to water seal by thoracics this AM
   - repeat CXR 4 hours after CT to waterseal (noon)
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult in the am depending on symptoms
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   .
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thorasics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control
   w/ metoprolol for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure after undergoing VATS Lingula/LLL biopsy. The patient initially did well after extubation but then experienced increased work of breathing and hypoxia. She was reintubated due to a high ET tube placement and subsequent hypoxia. A chest tube was placed on water seal this morning. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 95/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI of 47. The physical examination reveals an irregular bradycardic rhythm, lungs with inspiratory dry crackles more prominent on the left base, and a chest tube draining serosanguinous fluid.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 9.9 K/uL, Hct of 29.6%, platelet count of 131 K/uL, creatinine of 0"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can arise from the following conditions:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial complaint and subsequent events suggest a severe respiratory condition leading to hypoxia. The cause of this failure is unclear, but potential factors include flash pulmonary edema, aspiration with resulting pneumonia, or an underlying pulmonary infection. The patient's underlying lung disease is still uncertain and needs further investigation.

2. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which may contribute to their respiratory issues. Maintaining excellent blood pressure control and rate control is important for managing this condition.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate. They are currently on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control and coumadin for anticoagulation. It is necessary to restart coumadin as advised by the thoracic team, and rate control can be managed with metoprolol.

4. Macrocytic anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia with an unclear etiology. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, and initial tests should include checking B12, folate, iron studies, and trending for now.

5. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is currently on Humira and methotrexate. Considering the current situation, it may be necessary to hold these"

   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure: He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior
   to the VATS procedure and per the OSH report, he dramatically improved
   clinically (and his pulmonary infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.
   Apparently he initally did well after extubation but then had increased
   work of breathing and hypoxia.  It seems possible that he could have
   had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2.
   - will cover broadly for infection w/ antibiotics for now w/ Vanc/
   Zosyn
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday
   - plan to bronch in am if biopsy is non-diagnostic
   - plan to extubate in am
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult in the am
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - re-start coumadin per thorasics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation after a VATS procedure. He initially improved with steroids but then experienced increased work of breathing and hypoxia, leading to re-intubation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 95/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. He is also receiving propofol and metoprolol infusions. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is sedated, but responds to tactile stimuli. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with this condition and required intubation. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed.
2. Flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration: The patient may have experienced flash pulmonary edema or aspiration leading to acute decompensation requiring intubation. Monitoring for any signs of fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent surgical procedures (VATS and lingula/LLL biopsy). He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, which initially improved with steroids but then worsened, leading to intubation. The patient has been intubated three times in a 36-hour period. His current condition shows improvement, with a good cuff leak and excellent spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning. He is being covered broadly for infection with antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) and continues to receive methylprednisolone. A chest tube is in place, draining sero-sanguenous fluid from a post-operative complication. The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medications (Humira and Methotrexate) have been held. Further evaluation is needed for macrocytic anemia and congestive heart failure. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with digoxin and metoprolol, and anticoagulation will be restarted once stable.

Potential medical complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure: He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior
   to the VATS procedure and per the OSH report, he dramatically improved
   clinically (and his pulmonary infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.
   Apparently he initally did well after extubation but then had increased
   work of breathing and hypoxia.  It seems possible that he could have
   had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2 and his CXR appears much improved
   from his pre-intubation  film. Notably has been intubated now three
   times in a 36 hr period. He does have a good cuff leak at this point.
   His SBT is excellent this AM (volumes of 650 on 0/0).
   - will cover broadly for infection w/ antibiotics for now w/ Vanc/
   Zosyn (d 1= [**5-29**])
   - cont  methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday pending
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   - CT to water seal on the left (still with significant output), will
   f/u CXR today.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult when extubated
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .#. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - hold coumadin for now
   - as no systolic dysfunction, seems reasonable to cont metop as sole
   therapy (d/c digoxin)

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous VATS procedure. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has been intubated three times in the past 36 hours and currently has a good cuff leak. His blood cultures are negative for infection, but he is being covered broadly with antibiotics. He also has a chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, and there is a small left pleural effusion on the chest X-ray. The patient's macrocytic anemia etiology is unclear, and he has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for which he is currently on Humira and methotrexate. He also has a history of congestive heart failure with normal ejection fraction but diastolic dysfunction. The patient is currently being managed with excellent blood pressure control, rate control, and anticoagulation. He is NPO for possible extubation, and his glycemic control is being monitored. The patient's arterial line was placed due to inadequate advancement of the endotracheal tube, and he is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. His restraints are reviewed regularly, and he has a full code status. The patient is expected to stay in the ICU.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They were extubated and initially required a high level of oxygen, but have since been weaned to 5 liters of nasal cannula. The patient has been stable with regards to their pleural effusion. They have been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, antacids, heparin (for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis), and metoprolol. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, although they are experiencing atrial fibrillation. Their respiratory support consists of a nasal cannula and standby ventilator mode. The patient's blood gases show a slightly alkalotic pH and normal oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals coarse bibasilar rales in the lungs, a chest tube draining serosanguinous fluid, and no other significant findings. Lab results indicate elevated potassium levels and slightly abnormal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, as well as hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and total carbon dioxide levels. The patient's condition appears stable, with ongoing monitoring in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be implemented to prevent this complication."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient presented with hypoxia and was initially on high O2 requirement, but was extubated and placed on 80% facemask.
- A chest tube was placed due to a left pneumothorax, which has been stable.
- The patient's condition improved with steroids, suggesting a possible flash pulmonary edema or aspiration with resulting pneumonitis.
- There are bilateral reticulonodular opacities on the chest X-ray, with a left effusion and enlarged left apical pneumothorax.
- The patient's labs show a macrocytic anemia with unclear etiology, possibly due to anemia of chronic disease or methotrexate toxicity.
- The patient also has diastolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, for which he is being treated with digoxin and metoprolol.
- The patient's chest tube is currently set to water seal, and plans are to remove it when drainage is less than 100 cc per 24 hours.
- The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medications (methotrexate and Humira) have been held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required high O2 due to hypoxia, indicating respiratory failure. Although the patient has improved,"

   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Now extubated, with decreased O2 requirement
   He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior to the VATS procedure and per
   the OSH report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  Apparently he initally did well
   after extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
   It seems possible that he could have had flash pulmonary edema vs
   aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis vs pna that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2.  Unclear etiology of pulmonary
   infiltrates that brought him to [**Hospital 680**] Hospital.  Cx there w/ ngtd
   and apparently he dramatically improved w/ steroids.
   Nature of underlying lung disease not certain
 ddx broad including IPF
   or other ILD, methotrexate toxicity
   - in absence of fever or leukocytosis think pulmonary infection less
   likely, will DC vancomycin and zosyn once culture negative for 48
   hours. Will monitor closely
 usual s/sx of infection may be masked in
   setting of steroids
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS
   - wean O2, as tolerated
   .
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   Chest tube placed to water seal by thoracics this AM
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult in the am depending on symptoms
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools

   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control

   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure. Post-operatively, he required reintubation due to increased work of breathing and hypoxia. The etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates is unclear, but he responded well to steroids. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a concern for hypoxic respiratory failure, which has improved since extubation but still requires close monitoring. The underlying lung disease is not certain, and potential causes include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other interstitial lung diseases (ILD), or methotrexate toxicity. However, infection seems less likely in the absence of fever or leukocytosis, and cultures are negative for 48 hours. 

Secondly, the patient had a VATS procedure and has a chest tube in place draining serosanguinous fluid. There is also a small pneumothorax present, which has been stable. The plan is to wean off the chest tube when drainage is less than 100 cc per 24 hours.

Thirdly, the patient has rheumatoid arthritis and is on Humira and methotrexate. However, due to his current condition, it is advisable to hold these medications temporarily, and a rheumatology consult"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxia and was admitted to the ICU. The patient was initially on high O2 requirement but was weaned to 5L NC. A chest tube was placed due to pneumothorax, which is stable at water seal. The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula and standby ventilator mode.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/60 mmHg to 158/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is alert and following commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals bilateral reticulonodular opacities on chest X-ray, left effusion, and minimal enlargement of the left apical pneumothorax since May 30th.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has shown improvement since extubation, with decreased O2 requirement overnight. The underlying lung disease etiology is uncertain and could include IPF, other ILD, or methotrexate toxicity. Antibiotics will be continued, and close"

   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Now extubated, with decreased O2 requirement
   He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior to the VATS procedure and per
   the OSH report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  Apparently he initally did well
   after extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
   It seems possible that he could have had flash pulmonary edema vs
   aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis vs pna that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2.  Unclear etiology of pulmonary
   infiltrates that brought him to [**Hospital 680**] Hospital.  Cx there w/ ngtd
   and apparently he dramatically improved w/ steroids.
   Nature of underlying lung disease not certain
 ddx broad including IPF
   or other ILD, methotrexate toxicity
   - in absence of fever or leukocytosis think pulmonary infection less
   likely, will DC vancomycin and zosyn once culture negative for 48
   hours. Will monitor closely
 usual s/sx of infection may be masked in
   setting of steroids
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS
   - wean O2, as tolerated
   .
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   Chest tube placed to water seal by thoracics this AM
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult in the am depending on symptoms
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   .
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thorasics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and was initially intubated but later extubated. The patient had a VATS procedure and biopsy of the Lingula/LLL. He showed improvement with steroids but then experienced increased work of breathing and hypoxia, requiring re-intubation. The underlying cause of the pulmonary infiltrates is unclear, and possible causes include flash pulmonary edema, aspiration with resulting pneumonia, or another type of infection. The patient also has a chest tube in place draining serosanguenous fluid due to a small pneumothorax, which is being managed with water seal. He has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is currently on Humira and Methotrexate. The patient also has macrocytic anemia with an unclear etiology and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. He has atrial fibrillation and is being managed with digoxin and metoprolol for rate control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which required intubation. Although he was extubated, there is a risk of recurrence if the underlying cause is not addressed.
2. Flash pulmonary edema: This could be a possible cause of the patient's initial presentation and subsequent deterioration. It is important to closely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and had a lingula/LLL biopsy. He also has a chest tube placed for drainage of serosanguinous fluid. The patient was intubated due to acute decompensation but has now been extubated with decreased O2 requirement overnight. His pulmonary infiltrates improved with steroid treatment, suggesting flash pulmonary edema or aspiration with resulting pneumonitis. The etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates is unclear. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has anemia with a macrocytic picture, likely due to anemia of chronic disease or methotrexate toxicity. The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and is on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control. He also has atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's chest tube is draining serosanguinous fluid, and he has a left pneumothorax that is stable at the moment. His vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring.

   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Now extubated, with decreased O2 requirement overnight. Per the OSH
   report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  It seems possible that he could
   have had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis
   vs pna that caused acute decompensation requiring intubation. Given his
   improvement on abx this suggests some component of infection that may
   have been masked by steroids.  Unclear etiology of pulmonary
   infiltrates that brought him to [**Hospital 680**] Hospital.  Cx there w/ ngtd
   and apparently he dramatically improved w/ steroids.
   Nature of underlying lung disease not certain
 ddx broad including IPF
   or other ILD, methotrexate toxicity
   - Cont. vancomycin and zosyn for possible HAP. Will monitor closely
   usual s/sx of infection may be masked in setting of steroids
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 60 IV qday
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - resend sputum
   - wean O2, as tolerated
   .
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Has
   known L ptx, slightly enlarged today
   Chest tube placed to water seal by thoracics [**5-30**]
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   - appreciate thorasics input
 keep on waterseal
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - discuss treatment options with rheum
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   .
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thorasics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) procedure. He presented with hypoxia and was found to have bilateral reticulonodular opacities on chest X-ray, left-sided pleural effusion, and left apical pneumothorax. He was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and being managed in the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 121/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +1,070 mL in over 24 hours, with a total output of 3,720 mL and urine output of 3,430 mL.

His physical examination reveals coarse bibasilar rales in the lungs, no wheezing, and a chest tube draining serosanguinous fluid. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and with bowel sounds present. His extremities are warm, with no edema or palpable pulses. He appears comfortable and alert, following commands.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12,000 cells/mm³, elevated lactate levels, elevated creatinine, and hypoalbuminemia. Blood cultures have been sent, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in his pulmonary infiltrates, but he still has a left-sided pleural effusion and evidence of pneumothorax. The chest tube has been placed to water seal, and the plan is to remove it when the drainage is less than 100 cc per 24 hours. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to evaluate for worsening pneumothorax.

The patient's anemia is macrocytic in nature, and the etiology is unclear. Methotrexate toxicity is a possibility, but B12 and folate levels are normal. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with digoxin and metoprolol for rate control, and he will be discussed regarding the restart of anticoagulation therapy.

The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and will require close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate.

Overall, the patient's main medical complications at this time include hypoxic respiratory failure, potential infection (considering the improvement with antibiotics), macrocytic anemia, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, who presented with diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure and had biopsies taken from her lingula and left lower lobe. Postoperatively, she experienced increased work of breathing and hypoxia, leading to intubation. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory failure includes infection, inflammation, and volume overload. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and methylprednisolone, and additional tests are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections due to the invasive procedures and prolonged ICU stay. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but further monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and evaluation of the peripheral smear are recommended.
3. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia with unclear etiology. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and may be prone to CHF exacerbations. Maintaining excellent blood pressure control and rate control are important in managing her condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure: He appeared to be stable on 3L NC prior
   to the VATS procedure and per the OSH report, he dramatically improved
   clinically (and his pulmonary infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.
   Apparently he initally did well after extubation but then had increased
   work of breathing and hypoxia.  It seems possible that he could have
   had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration that caused acute
   decompensation requiring intubation.  His CXR at the time of
   re-intubation looks dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we
   have already been able to wean FiO2 and his CXR appears much improved
   from his pre-intubation  film. Notably has been intubated now three
   times in a 36 hr period. He does have a good cuff leak at this point.
   His SBT is excellent this AM (volumes of 650 on 0/0).
   - will cover broadly for infection w/ antibiotics for now w/ Vanc/
   Zosyn (d 1= [**5-29**])
   - cont  methylpresnisolone to 125 IV qday pending
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Small
   PTX on am CXR
   - CT to water seal on the left (still with significant output), will
   f/u CXR today.
   - appreciate thorasics input
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - will consider Rheum consult when extubated
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
   - check b12, folate, iron studies
   - trend for now
   - guaiac all stools
   .#. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - hold coumadin for now
   - as no systolic dysfunction, seems reasonable to cont metop as sole
   therapy (d/c digoxin)

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure and subsequent lingula/LLL biopsy. The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, which initially improved with steroids but then deteriorated, leading to intubation. He has been intubated three times in a 36-hour period. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 121/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and absent pulses in both lower extremities. His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels. The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and is currently on medication for rate control and anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of hypoxia and subsequent intubation indicate ongoing respiratory distress. This could be due to flash pulmonary edema or aspiration.
2. Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient has a small pneumothorax that has not fully resolved despite chest tube placement. Close monitoring and follow-up chest X-rays are necessary to evaluate for"

   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Now extubated, with decreased O2 requirement overnight. Per the OSH
   report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  It seems possible that he could
   have had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis
   vs pna that caused acute decompensation requiring intubation. Given his
   improvement on abx this suggests some component of infection that may
   have been masked by steroids.  Unclear etiology of pulmonary
   infiltrates that brought him to [**Hospital 680**] Hospital.  Cx there w/ ngtd
   and apparently he dramatically improved w/ steroids.
   Nature of underlying lung disease not certain
 ddx broad including IPF
   or other ILD, methotrexate toxicity
   - Cont. vancomycin and zosyn for possible HAP. Will monitor closely
   usual s/sx of infection may be masked in setting of steroids
   - decrease dose of methylpresnisolone to 60 IV qday
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - resend sputum
   - wean O2, as tolerated
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.  Has
   known L ptx, slightly enlarged today
   Chest tube placed to water seal by thoracics [**5-30**]
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   - appreciate thorasics input
 keep on waterseal today
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate and humira for now
   - discuss treatment options with rheum
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thorasics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control
   w/ metoprolol for now

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous ventricular assist device (VAD) placement. He presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. His condition improved with steroids, suggesting a possible component of infection. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary infiltrates, but the underlying cause is still unclear. The differential diagnosis includes interstitial lung disease (ILD), methotrexate toxicity, and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient is currently receiving continuous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam infusions for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. He is alert and oriented, with no murmurs or edema noted on physical examination. He has a chest tube in place, which is currently on water seal after being placed due to left-sided pleural effusion (ptx). 

The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, sodium of 125 mg/dL, potassium of 0.7 mg/dL, creatinine of 0."

   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Increased O2 requirement this AM, in setting of enlarged ptx and
   increased secretions. Has S. aureus from his sputum here. Path from
   VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering mtx
   lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. vancomycin and zosyn for HCAP. Increase zosyn dosing to q6h.
   - Repeat sputum today
   - Continue methylprednisolone
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - Chest PT, MIE q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -1L today
   - Repeat ABG in PM
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, enlarged today
   - appreciate thoracics input
 place back on low wall suction
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear

   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, s/p VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) with Lingula/LLL biopsy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has increased oxygen requirements due to enlarged pleural effusion (ptx) and increased secretions. Sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus, indicating possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). The patient's path report from VATS is consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which suggests underlying rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). Methotrexate lung toxicity is also being considered as a possible cause of hypoxia post VATS. 

The patient is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for HCAP, with an increased dosing frequency of Zosyn to every 6 hours. Sputum culture will be repeated today. The patient is also on methylprednisolone, and the path specimen is being asked to be rushed. 

The patient has a chest tube in place, draining serosanguinous fluid, and is on water seal. The left-sided pleural effusion has increased today. The patient's chest tube will be placed back on low wall suction, and daily chest X-rays will"

   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Now extubated, with decreased O2 requirement overnight. Per the OSH
   report, he dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary
   infiltrates improved) w/ steroids.  It seems possible that he could
   have had flash pulmonary edema vs aspiration with resuting pneumonitiis
   vs pna that caused acute decompensation requiring intubation. Given his

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure after undergoing a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and biopsy of the lingula and left lower lobe.

The patient's current condition shows improvement since being extubated, with decreased oxygen requirements. The underlying lung disease etiology is uncertain, but possibilities include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other interstitial lung disease (ILD), or methotrexate toxicity. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient also has a chest tube in place, draining sero-sanguenous fluid, and has known left pleural effusion (ptx). The chest tube is currently on water seal and will likely be removed when drainage is less than 100 cc per 24 hours. Daily chest X-rays will be evaluated for worsening ptx.

The patient's rheumatoid arthritis treatment will be temporarily held, and further discussion with the rheumatology department is needed regarding treatment options. The patient's macrocytic anemia etiology is unclear, and it may be related to anemia of chronic disease or methotrexate use. A complete blood smear has been ordered, and the hemat"

       - Did have pulse steroids prior to VATs for presumed AE-ILD;
   currently on Prednisone 60.  Will taper
   2) Pneumothorax
       - PTX increasing. will place chest tube back to wall suction. No
   pulsus paradoxis

   3) Atrial fibrillation
       - Currently rate controlled.
       - No indication for anticoagulation
   4) HFnEF
       - Keep I/O -500 to -1L
       - Will restart meds when more stable

","Summary:
- 76-year-old patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and RA-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) admitted for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
- Course complicated by post-VATS hypoxemia requiring intubation, thought secondary to acute exacerbation of ILD (AE-ILD) versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- Patient extubated to 5L nasal cannula but became hypoxemic and required up to 70% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
- Small pneumothorax (PTX) present, switched to water seal yesterday.
- Failed speech and swallow evaluation.
- Allergies: Niacin, unknown.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 03:00 AM and Vancomycin at 08:00 AM.
- Current infusions: Heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Metoprolol.
- Review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below.

24-hour events:
- Extubated to 5L NC --> Became hypoxemic requiring up to FM 70% yesterday; having some difficulty clearing thick tan secretions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and RA-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), admitted for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The patient's post-VATS course has been complicated by hypoxemia, thought to be secondary to aspiration-related events or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. They have a small pleural effusion and have failed speech and swallow evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's main contributor to hypoxemia is likely pneumonia with secretions and plugging. Worsening pneumothorax and volume status are also contributing factors. The patient requires aggressive pulmonary hygiene, including daily incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and maintaining an upright position. Fluid balance should be managed to keep inputs and outputs equal to -1 liter. Sputum cultures will be repeated to identify concomitant organisms, and the patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. FiO2 should be weaned to maintain SpO2 above 93%.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has an increasing pneumothorax. A chest tube has been placed back to wall suction, and there is no pulsus paradoxus. The chest tube may need repositioning, and thoracic surgery will be consulted.

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with RA (Humira, MTX), HFnEF, Afib, with UIP, admit with hypoxemia
   after VATs.
   1) Hypoxemia
       - Likely multifactorial, including worsening PTX and increased
   secretions from known S. aureus pneumonia. Could volume be playing a
   role?
       - Will f/u ABG to exclude hypoventilation
       - Will need aggressive pulmonary hygiene given weak diaphragm
           + MIE q2hr
           + chest PT
           + Bronchodilators
           + Keep upright
       - Will diurese to keep I/O= -1L
       - Will resend sputum cultures to look for concomitant organisms -->
   currently on Vanc and Zosyn
       - Wean FiO2 to keep SpO2 >93%
       - Did have pulse steroids prior to VATs for presumed AE-ILD;
   currently on Prednisone 60
   2) Pneumothorax
       - PTX increasing. will place chest tube back to wall suction. No
   pulsus paradoxis
       - Chest tube may need repositioning
   3) Atrial fibrillation
       - Currently rate controlled.
       - No indication for anticoagulation
   4) HFnEF
       - Keep I/O -500 to -1L
       - Will restart meds when more stable
   5) RA
       - Currently off of Humira and MTX
       - On steroids

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and RA-associated interstitial lung disease, admitted for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Post-VATS, the patient developed hypoxemia requiring intubation, possibly secondary to acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently extubated and on supplemental oxygen via aerosol-cool. He has a small pneumothorax that has not resolved and has been switched to water seal. The patient failed a speech and swallow evaluation.

24-hour events include the patient becoming hypoxemic and requiring increased FiO2, with difficulty clearing thick tan secretions. The patient's pathology is consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

The patient is on various medications, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin, for suspected Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. He is also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, metoprolol, and prednisone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/76 mmHg to 95/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and an irregularly irregular heartbeat.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Increased O2 requirement yesterday, in setting of enlarged ptx and
   increased secretions. Has S. aureus from his sputum here. Path from
   VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering mtx
   lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. vancomycin and zosyn for HCAP. Increase zosyn dosing to q6h.
   - Repeat sputum pending
   - Continue methylprednisolone
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - Chest PT, MIE q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -1L today
   - Repeat ABG in PM
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, enlarged today
   - appreciate thoracics input
 place back on low wall suction
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control
   w/ metoprolol for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) with Lingula/LLL biopsy. The patient has an enlarged pleural effusion (ptx), coarse bibasilar rales, and is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. He is also experiencing increased O2 requirements, increased secretions, and has S. aureus from his sputum. The cause of hypoxia post-VATS is uncertain, with possible causes including flash pulmonary edema or aspiration. The patient is receiving continuous vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), with increased zosyn dosing to q6h. Methylprednisolone is being continued, and follow-up pending micro and path, CIS, and rush specimen are planned. Chest PT and MIE q2hours are being performed to facilitate clearance of secretions. The goal is to achieve a fluid balance of -1L today. Repeat ABG in the PM is also indicated. The patient has a chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, with known left pleural effusion (L ptx), which has enlarged today.

   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Increased O2 requirement yesterday, in setting of enlarged ptx and
   increased secretions. Has S. aureus from his sputum here. Path from
   VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering mtx
   lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. vancomycin and zosyn for HCAP. Increase zosyn dosing to q6h.
   - Repeat sputum pending
   - Continue methylprednisolone
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - Chest PT, MIE q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -1L today
   - Repeat ABG in PM
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, enlarged today
   - appreciate thoracics input
 place back on low wall suction
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control
   w/ metoprolol for now

   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Increased O2 requirement yesterday, in setting of enlarged pneumothorax
   and increased secretions. Has S. aureus from his sputum here. Path from
   VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering
   methotrexate lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain -?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Continue zosyn for HAP
 d/c vancomycin as patient has grown MSSA
   - Repeat sputum pending
   - Continue methylprednisolone
   - Follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - Chest PT, MIE to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -500cc today
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L PTX, enlarged today
   - Appreciate thoracics input
 place back on low wall suction
   - Daily CXR to evaluated PTX
   - Would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis: No acute issues.
   - Continue methylprednisolone
 start PCP prophylaxis and
   calcium/vitamin D for bone health
   - Hold methotrexate
   - [**Month (only) 8**] resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Stable. Consider anemia of
   chronic disease, with MTX contributing. B12 and folate WNL.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - Maintain excellent BP control
   - Rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - Holding coumadin for now, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control
   - Discontinued home digoxin as no evidence of systolic dysfunction

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and recent surgery for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/55 mmHg to 153/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient has an increased pneumothorax, which has been addressed by changing the chest tube to suction from water seal. There is also a concern for aspiration, as the nasogastric (NG) tube was initially out of position. The patient continues to have copious secretions and is on multiple medications including zosyn, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with decreased hematocrit and potassium levels. The patient's blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.50 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 442.

The patient's chest X-ray shows an enlarged pneumothorax, and a thoracic procedure"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and lingula/LLL biopsy, and now presents with increased oxygen requirement, enlarged pleural effusion (ptx), increased secretions, and suspected Staphylococcus aureus infection in his sputum. There is also a concern for aspiration or flash pulmonary edema as potential causes of hypoxia post-VATS. The patient has a chest tube in place, draining sero-sanguenous fluid, and has known left pleural effusion (ptx), which is enlarged today. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97F), heart rate of 73 bpm (normal range: 50-101 bpm), blood pressure of 119/55 mmHg (normal range: 76-153/84 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.2-9.8 thousand/mm³, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 120-151 thousand/mm³, and slightly elevated creatinine levels of 0.7-0.8 mg/dL. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels are within normal range. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows a large left-sided pleural effusion and the presence of coarse bibasilar rales on lung auscultation. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, increasing zosyn dosing to every 6 hours, repeating sputum culture today, continuing methylprednisolone, following input/output fluids, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter today, repeating arterial blood gas (ABG) in the evening, and daily chest X-rays to evaluate for worsening pleural effusion. The patient's chest tube should be placed back on low wall suction, and daily CXR should be done to evaluate for worsening pleural effusion. 

Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening pleural effusion, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and further deterioration of kidney function."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) who was admitted to the hospital for worsening dyspnea. He underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge biopsy, which revealed usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Post-operative complications included Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, requiring re-intubation, copious secretions, diaphragmatic weakness, and persistent post-operative pneumothorax. The patient remains in the ICU due to high FiO2 requirements, diaphragmatic weakness, and persistent pneumothorax. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by underlying UIP, S. aureus pneumonia, and possibly aspiration.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a persistent post-operative pneumothorax, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. S. aureus pneumonia: The patient had a previous episode of S. aureus pneumonia that required intubation and antibiotic treatment. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the infection.
4. Diaphragmatic weakness: The patient is experiencing weakness in the diaphragm, which can impair respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Aspiration: Given the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is likely multifactorial, including underlying UIP, acute injury and diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
2. Discrepancy between SpO2 and PaO2: There seems to be a discrepancy between the oxygen saturation levels measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and arterial blood gas (PaO2). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, including checking for hemoglobinopathy (methemoglobin).
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has persistent post-operative pneumothorax, which has resolved on chest X-ray. The chest tube will be placed to water seal today and re-imaged tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted to the hospital for worsening dyspnea. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge biopsy, which showed consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Post-operative complications included Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia requiring re-intubation and extubation. The patient remains in the ICU due to high FiO2 requirements, copious secretions, diaphragmatic weakness, and persistent post-operative pneumothorax. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen levels in the blood, likely due to underlying UIP, AIP/DAD, and S. aureus pneumonia.
2. Discrepancy between SpO2 and PaO2: There is a discrepancy between the oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and arterial blood gas (PaO2), which may indicate an underlying hemoglobinopathy (methemoglobinemia) or other factors affecting oxygen delivery.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient initially had a persistent post-operative pneumothorax, but it has since resolved on chest X-ray. However, the patient remains on chest tube to water seal, and re-imaging will be done to monitor the progress.
4. S. aureus Pneumonia: The patient had an infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and vancomycin has been discontinued. The patient will continue on Zosyn, an antibiotic effective against MSSA, for now. If repeat cultures show no growth, the antibiotic may be narrowed to nafcillin.
5. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is currently on steroids. The patient was previously on Humira and methotrexate as outpatient medications.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with medication. The patient's anticoagulation status will be discussed with the thoracic department when appropriate.
7. Other: The patient has other comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. These conditions require careful monitoring and management during the patient's stay in the ICU.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge resection. The patient developed Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and required re-intubation. The patient remains in the ICU due to high FiO2 requirements, copious secretions, diaphragmatic weakness, and persistent post-operative pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress and could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Pneumothorax: The presence of a persistent post-operative pneumothorax increases the risk of tension pneumothorax, which can cause respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse.
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient's underlying rheumatoid arthritis may increase the risk of complications such as infection or poor wound healing.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to poor cardiac output, embolic events, and an increased risk of thromboembolic complications.
5. Infection: The patient has already had an episode of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, indicating an increased susceptibility to infections in the ICU setting.
6. Diaphragmatic Weakness: The patient's diaphragmatic weakness may impair ventilation and increase the risk of respiratory failure.

   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Increased O2 requirement yesterday, in setting of enlarged ptx and
   increased secretions. Has S. aureus from his sputum here. Path from
   VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering mtx
   lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. vancomycin and zosyn for HCAP. Increase zosyn dosing to q6h.
   - Repeat sputum pending
   - Continue methylprednisolone
   - follow up pending micro and path, CIS, ask path to rush specimen
   - Chest PT, MIE q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -1L today
   - Repeat ABG in PM
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, enlarged today
   - appreciate thoracics input
 place back on low wall suction
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24 hrs
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate control
   w/ metoprolol for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and lingula/LLL biopsy. He has been experiencing increased oxygen requirements, enlarged pleural effusion, and increased secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, aspiration, or complications from the VATS procedure. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's oxygen levels and adjust the respiratory support accordingly.

2. Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient has known left pleural effusion, which has worsened since admission. There is a risk of developing tension pneumothorax, especially with the presence of a chest tube. Close monitoring of the chest tube drainage and daily chest X-rays are necessary to evaluate for worsening PTX.

3. Methotrexate Toxicity: The patient is taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis, which can potentially cause lung toxicity. This could contribute to the hypoxic respiratory failure and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

4. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia with an unclear etiology. It is important to further investigate the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, who is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. He has undergone a VATS procedure and has been found to have bilateral retic/nodular opacities on chest X-ray, with left effusion versus consolidation, decreased left pneumothorax. The lung biopsies show severe patchy interstitial fibrosis with honeycomb change, focal fibroblastic foci, focal organizing pneumonitis, and mild to moderate chronic interstitial inflammation, consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The patient also has a macrocytic anemia, likely due to anemia of chronic disease or methotrexate toxicity. He has a history of diastolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, for which he is on digoxin and metoprolol. The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, lansoprazole (Prevacid), metoprolol, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern at the moment is his hypoxic respiratory failure, which requires significant oxygen supplementation. The cause of hypoxia post VATs is uncertain, with possibilities including flash pulmonary edema, aspiration, or underlying rheumatoid arthritis interstitial lung disease (ILD).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, who presented with hypoxia and was admitted to the ICU. He underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and had lung biopsies taken. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and a left-sided pleural effusion. He is still requiring significant oxygen support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia persists despite supplemental oxygen, which indicates a potential complication in his respiratory function. Further evaluation and management are needed to improve oxygenation.
2. Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient has a known left-sided pneumothorax that has increased in size. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as chest tube placement and drainage, are necessary to manage this complication.
3. Sero-sanguenous pleural fluid drainage: The presence of sero-sanguenous fluid from the chest tube suggests ongoing pleural inflammation or infection. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotic therapy may be required based on the results.
4. Macrocytic anemia: The patient's anemia of chronic disease may be exacerbated by methotrexate therapy. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment.
5. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and current presentation"

   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Still with significant O2 requirement, in setting of ptx and increased
   secretions. Has S. aureus and H influenzae from his sputum here. Path
   from VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering
   mtx lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. zosyn for HCAP, day 1=[**5-29**] for 14 day course
   - Continue methylprednisolone, decrease to 40mg daily today
   - Chest PT, MIE q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -1L today, will give 20mg IV now
   - Repeat ABG in PM
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, stable today without leak
   - appreciate thoracics input
 on waterseal now
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs, possibly today
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, digoxin was discontinued, however
   somewhat limited by HR with metoprolol now so will favor restarting
   home dose of dig today and cont. metoprolol 12.5mg tid

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, who is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) and lingula/LLL (left lower lobe) biopsy. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia caused by S. aureus and H. influenzae, and possible methotrexate-induced lung toxicity. He also has a known left pneumothorax (ptx), which is currently being managed with a chest tube on water seal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is hypoxic respiratory failure, which requires ongoing oxygen support. The cause of this condition post-VATS is uncertain, with possibilities such as flash pulmonary edema or aspiration. It is important to continue treating the underlying infection with antibiotics and to facilitate clearance of secretions through chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry.
2. Left Pneumothorax (ptx): The patient has a known left ptx, which is currently being managed with a chest tube on water seal. Daily chest X-rays will be needed to evaluate for worsening ptx. The chest tube may be removed when drainage is less than 100 cc/24 hours, possibly today.
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis management needs to be adjusted"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing ventilation support in the ICU. He has undergone VATS and wedge resection for UIP and is currently experiencing hypoxemia, likely due to underlying UIP with an overlying AIP/DAD, as well as S. aureus pneumonia and pneumothorax. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics for S. aureus pneumonia, steroids, bronchodilators, and others. The patient's nutritional support is provided through Fibersource HN at 70 mL/hour, and he is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include boots, SQ UF Heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcer, and HOB elevation for VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen due to underlying interstitial lung disease (UIP), acute interstitial pneumonia/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), S. aureus pneumonia, and pneumothorax.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small pneumothorax that needs careful monitoring and appropriate management.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation should be managed with appropriate anticoagulation and rate control medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing treatment for severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. He also has underlying interstitial lung disease and has undergone a VATS procedure with wedge resection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/57 to 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on several medications including lansoprazole, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and others. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a low potassium level. Imaging studies reveal resolution of pneumothorax but will require re-imaging tomorrow. The patient's overall condition is being managed with aggressive pulmonary hygiene, bronchodilators, and steroid taper for acute exacerbation of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia due to underlying interstitial lung disease, an overlying acute interstitial pneumonia/diffuse alveolar damage, and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and consideration of interventions such as"

   VATS and Lingula/LLL biopsy, bx c/w UIP.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Still with significant O2 requirement,
   in setting of ptx. Has S. aureus and H influenzae and GNR from his
   sputum here. Path from VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. zosyn for HCAP, day 1=[**5-29**] for 14 day course
   - decrease methylprednisolone to 20 today
   - Chest PT q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, stable today without leak
   - appreciate thoracics input
 start waterseal now then repeat CXR
   after 4 hours
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs, possibly today
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased but likely due to diuresis
   - monitor WBC
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u culture data
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well. Hypoxic with increased HR
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   - I/O goal of even
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, digoxin was discontinued, however
   somewhat limited by HR with metoprolol now so continue digoxin today
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q 6 hours for HR control

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of Rheumatoid Arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure following a VATS procedure and Lingula/LLL biopsy. The patient has been diagnosed with UIP, likely secondary to Rheumatoid Arthritis. He has a chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, and his lung fields show bibasilar rales. His vital signs are stable, but he remains hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to diuresis. He also has macrocytic anemia of unclear etiology. The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and is being managed for congestive heart failure. He has been started on digoxin for rate control and will be restarted on warfarin for anticoagulation. The patient's current medications include Humira and Methotrexate for Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as various ICU medications for prophylaxis and treatment of his conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and Methotrexate, diastolic
   heart failure, atrial fibrillation with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure
   s/p vats and Lingula/LLL biopsy.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:
   Still with significant O2 requirement, in setting of ptx and increased
   secretions. Has S. aureus and H influenzae from his sputum here. Path
   from VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD. Also considering
   mtx lung toxicity.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. zosyn for HCAP, day 1=[**5-29**] for 14 day course
   - Continue methylprednisolone, decrease to 40mg daily today
   - Chest PT, MIE q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   - Follow I/O, goal -1L today, will give 20mg IV now
   - Repeat ABG in PM
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, stable today without leak
   - appreciate thoracics input
 on waterseal now
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs, possibly today
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt
   rheumatologist
   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - check smear
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well.
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, digoxin was discontinued, however
   somewhat limited by HR with metoprolol now so will favor restarting
   home dose of dig today and cont. metoprolol 12.5mg tid

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with lingula/LLL biopsy. The patient still requires significant oxygen support and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. The cause of hypoxia post VATS is uncertain, with possible causes including flash pulmonary edema or aspiration.

The patient has a chest tube in place, draining sero-sanguenous fluid, and is currently on water seal. There is known left pleural effusion (ptx), which is stable today without leak. The plan is to continue chest tube drainage and perform daily chest X-rays to evaluate for worsening ptx. When drainage is less than 100 cc/24 hours, the chest tube may be discontinued.

The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medications, including methotrexate and Humira, have been temporarily held. His anemia of chronic disease or macrocytic anemia etiology is unclear, and further evaluation is needed. The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and is currently being managed with excellent blood pressure control and rate control.

The patient is currently on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control, as well as warfarin for anticoagulation."

   - Will continue Zosyn for now given ? aspiration event; if repeat
   cultures show no GNR,
    - continue aggressive pulmonary hygiene with MIE, bronchodilators
    > Pneumothorax
    - Cont small PTX conts to get larger when not on -20 cm (will try
   again on Water seal) and repeat CXR
   -  Thoracic surgery continues to follow- appreciate their input will
   discuss management
    Rheumatoid arthritis
   - Was on Humira and MTX as outpt; per rheumatology team these therapies
   on hold.
    > Atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction:
   - Cont digoxin as he was hypotensive with metop (lowered to 12.5 mg
   tid) when he can tolerate PO
   - will need to change meds to IV pending new NG tube
   - defer anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and underlying interstitial lung disease (UIP) who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection. He presented with Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia requiring intubation and has been experiencing significant oxygen requirements and limited progress over the last few days. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, S. aureus and H. flu PNA, pneumothorax, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's underlying UIP, acute inflammatory pneumonitis/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), S. aureus pneumonia/H. flu infection, and pulmonary thromxosis (PTX) contribute to his hypoxemia. Aggressive pulmonary hygiene, including mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE), bronchodilators, and continued antibiotic therapy, will be crucial in managing this condition.
2. S. aureus and H. flu PNA: The patient is currently on piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for his pneumonia, which should be continued. However, if repeat cultures show no growth of gram-negative rods (GNR), zosyn may be discontinued.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small pneumoth"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection for upper lobe infiltrate with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient required intubation and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxemia: Multifactorial, likely due to underlying underlying interstitial pneumonia (UIP), acute interstitial pneumonia/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and pneumothorax.
- S. aureus pneumonia: Sensitivity shows methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), so vancomycin will be discontinued, and piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-Tazo) will be continued.
- Pneumothorax: Small pneumothorax present, being monitored and managed by thoracic surgery.
- Rheumatoid arthritis: On hold due to current critical illness.
- Atrial fibrillation: Being managed with digoxin and deferring anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and the presence of S. aureus pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and critical illness.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection. He has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia, requiring intubation due to significant oxygen requirements and limited progress over the last few days.

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemia, which is multifactorial and likely due to underlying underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (UIP), acute interstitial pneumonia/adult respiratory distress syndrome (AIP/DAD), Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia/Haemophilus influenzae infection, and pneumothorax.

The treatment plan includes continuing piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for 14 days, stopping mechanical incentive ventilation (MIE), continuing steroid taper for acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF), and weaning down solumedrol. The patient will remain on proton pump inhibitor (PPI), calcium/vitamin D supplements, and pulmonary hygiene with MIE and bronchodilators.

The patient's culture results show growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. The plan is to continue Pip-Tazo and Zosyn, unless repeat cultures show no gram-negative rods. The small pneumothorax will be managed by continuing small chest tube drainage and attempting to extubate"

The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia caused by H. influenzae and S. aureus, as indicated by the sputum culture.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate in the 70-80s with occasional spikes to 140-150 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/54mmHg to 123/73mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and they are currently on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control.

The patient has been started on IV Lopressor to manage their heart rate, and their digoxin dose has been increased. They are also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure after undergoing a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and lingula/LLL biopsy, which showed usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) consistent with underlying RA-ILD. The cause of hypoxia post-VATS is uncertain, possibly flash pulmonary edema or aspiration. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has required significant O2 supplementation due to persistent hypoxia. He also has a chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, and there is known left-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate ranging from 69-110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/54-123/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 78-143 mg/dL.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 170 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient has been in the ICU for the past 24 hours. During this time, the patient's heart rate has mainly been in the 70-80s but occasionally spikes to 140-150 bpm. The patient is currently on digoxin 0.125mg daily and has been switched from oral lopressor to 5mg IV lopressor given every 4 hours.

The patient experiences desaturation with any slight movement and is on 6 liters of nasal cannula (NC). The plan is to call the family regarding the need for intubation, and they will likely say not to intubate at this point. The patient is currently still full code.

The patient's chest tube (CT) has been changed to water seal, with no real change in pneumothorax (PTX). The thoracic surgeon believes the patient will need pleuradesis as he will unlikely improve given stiff lungs related to interstitial lung disease (ILD). Mechanical in-exsufflation (MIE) has been stopped.

The patient's steroid dose has been decreased to 20mg IV once today, with a plan to continue weaning rapidly. Sedation and analgesia (S+S) will be re-evaluated at 2120-6-5. Haloperidol (Haldol) 0.5mg has been started every third (tid) as needed for anxiety.

The patient has allergies to niacin and an unknown medication. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 2120-6-2 at 8:00 AM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 2120-6-5 at 4:00 AM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), haloperidol (Haldol), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and metoprolol. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and ABG results.

Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) of 8 cm, bibasilar rales louder on the left side, and upper lung fields. The patient has impaired skin integrity.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels. The patient also has hypercalcemia (Ca++), hypomagnesemia (Mg++), and hyperphosphatemia (PO4). Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include atrial fibrillation (AF"

The patient is currently on digoxin 0.125mg daily and IV lopressor 5mg every 4 hours. The patient also experiences desaturation with slight movement and is being managed with supplemental oxygen through a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 905mL and total output of 1880mL since 12 AM, indicating positive fluid balance. The patient's respiratory support includes being on 6 liters of supplemental oxygen, and their ABG results indicate a slightly elevated pH level of 7.47.

Physical examination findings include an unassessed peripheral vascular examination, not assessed skin examination, and not assessed neurologic examination. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte levels within normal range. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating between 78-143 mg/dL.

   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Still with significant O2 requirement,
   in setting of ptx. Has S. aureus and H influenzae and GNR from his
   sputum here. Path from VATs c/w UIP, suggestive of underlying RA ILD.
   Cause of hypoxia post VATs not certain ?flash pulmonary edema,
   aspiration.
   - Cont. zosyn for HCAP, day 1=[**5-29**] for 14 day course
   - decrease methylprednisolone to 20 today
   - Chest PT q2hours to facilitate clearance of secretions
   #. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid, on
   water seal.  Has known L ptx, stable today without leak
   - appreciate thoracics input
 start waterseal now then repeat CXR
   after 4 hours
   - daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
   - would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/ 24
   hrs, possibly today
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis:
   - hold methotrexate
   - may resume humira as an outpt 2+ weeks p VATs, defer to outpt

   # Leukocytosis: WBC increased but likely due to diuresis
   - monitor WBC

   #. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology. Consider anemia of chronic
   disease. MTX could be contributory. B12 and folate WNL.
   - trend hct for now
   - guaiac all stools
   #. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.  As a
   result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe hypertension
   well. Hypoxic with increased HR
   - maintain excellent BP control
   - rate control as below
   - I/O goal of even
   #. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an outpatient
   and coumadin for anticoagulation.
   - holding coumadin, will discuss re-starting with thoracics
   - as no systolic dysfunction, digoxin was discontinued, however
   somewhat limited by HR with metoprolol now so continue digoxin today

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, who presented with diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic respiratory failure following a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure. The patient has been experiencing significant oxygen requirements due to lingula/LLL biopsy complications and has a known left pleural effusion (ptx). The patient's chest tube is currently draining sero-sanguenous fluid and is on water seal. The patient's medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis, for which he was taking Humira and Methotrexate. His current medications include digoxin, metoprolol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and haldol. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to diuresis. He also has macrocytic anemia with an unclear etiology and is being monitored closely. The patient's heart failure is likely diastolic in nature, and he has a history of diastolic dysfunction. He is currently on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control, but his heart rate remains uncontrolled. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) and lingula/LLL (left lower lobe) biopsy, which showed UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia). The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, worsened pneumothorax on the left, leukocytosis, macrocytic anemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient has a worsening pneumothorax on the left side. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and may require pleurodesis or chest tube placement for management.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and possible progression to sepsis.
3. CHF: The patient has diastolic heart failure, and there is a risk of worsening CHF symptoms such as fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as thromboembolism or stroke if anticoagulation is not properly managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing VATs and wedge resection, who now requires intubation due to significant oxygen requirements and limited progress over the last few days. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels are likely due to underlying underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (UIP), acute injury to the lungs (AIP/DAD), pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, and pneumothorax.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small pneumothorax that appears larger in the morning, and the physician is concerned about the patient's ability to tolerate it. 

3. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis therapies are currently on hold.

4. Atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction: The patient is only on metoprolol 5 mg IV q 6hr for atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction, and anticoagulation is deferred.

5. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition status is a concern, and a speech-language pathology (SLP) evaluation is planned today. If the patient cannot take oral intake, an NG tube may be necessary for longer-term management.

6. Additional issues per ICU resident: The patient requires ICU care, including potential NG tube placement for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection. He was admitted due to severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. The patient required intubation and has significant oxygen requirements. His progress has been limited over the last few days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which can be attributed to underlying underlying interstitial pneumonia (UIP), acute interstitial pneumonia/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and pneumothorax.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small pneumothorax that appears larger this morning, and there are concerns about his ability to tolerate it.
3. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for the pneumonia.
4. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis therapies are currently on hold.
5. Atrial Fibrillation and Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient is only on metoprolol 5 mg IV q 6hr for atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction.

   76yo with RA, UIP s/p VATs and wedge resection, with S. aureus / H flu
   pnaa requiring intubation now with signifincant O2 requirement and
   limited progress over the last few days.
   > Hypoxemia: Multifactorial- likely due to underlying UIP, with an
   overlying AIP/DAD (though not supported by biopsy), as well as S.
   aureus pneumonia / H. flu and PTX
   - Cont Pip-tazo (day 1 of abx = [**5-29**]) with planned 14 day course
   - stop MIE (not getting up secretions)
   - Remains on steroid taper for ? AE-IPF, wean solumedrol to 20 mg today
   -On PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], Ca/Vit D, PPI
   - Goal fluid balance even today
   > S. aureus  and H. flu PNA
   - will cont the Pip-Tazo (D1= [**5-29**])
    > Pneumothorax
    - Cont small PTX conts to get larger when not on -20 cm (will try
   again on Water seal) and repeat CXR
   -  Thoracic surgery continues to follow- appreciate their input will
   discuss management
    Rheumatoid arthritis
   - Was on Humira and MTX as outpt; per rheumatology team these therapies
   on hold.
    > Atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction:
   - Cont digoxin as he was hypotensive with metop (lowered to 12.5 mg
   tid) when he can tolerate PO
   - will need to change meds to IV pending new NG tube
   - defer anticoagulation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection. He was admitted for severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus flu, resulting in the need for intubation. The patient has shown limited progress in recent days and continues to require significant oxygen support.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemia, S. aureus and H. flu pneumonia, pneumothorax, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic dysfunction. He is currently on multiple medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (antibiotics), metoprolol, heparin (prophylaxis), pantoprazole, haloperidol, and a steroid taper.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/54 mmHg to 123/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin at 32.0 g/dL, platelet count at 170 K/uL, sodium at 137 mg/dL, potassium at 4"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia caused by H flu and S aureus. The patient underwent VATS and lingula/LLL biopsy, which showed UIP consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula. The patient has a chest tube in place due to a pneumothorax on the left side, which has slightly worsened compared to the previous day. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they exhibit leukocytosis, macrocytic anemia, and CHF. The patient is currently receiving various medications including haloperidol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an increase in the severity of the aspiration pneumonia or if the patient develops any complications related to the mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumothorax: The worsening of the left-sided pneumothorax could lead to further respiratory distress and may require additional interventions such as pleurodesis or placement of a one-way valve.
3. Macrocytic anemia: The etiology of the macrocytic anemia needs to be investigated further, and appropriate management should be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic respiratory failure following a VATS procedure and lingula/LLL biopsy, which showed UIP. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to her underlying condition. This can lead to decreased oxygen supply to vital organs and may result in further complications if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient has been exposed to different bacteria (MSSA, H flu, and GNR) and has received antibiotics for treatment. If the infection spreads or if there is resistance to the antibiotics, it can lead to a serious infection.
3. Macrocytic anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia with an unclear etiology. This condition can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms if left untreated.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which is a type of CHF. Poor management of this condition can lead to worsening heart function and fluid accumulation in the body.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of blood clot formation and can result in stroke or other cardiovascular complications if not adequately managed.
6. Medication interactions: The patient is taking multiple medications, including Humira, Methotrexate, digoxin, and others. Interactions between these medications can occur and may cause adverse effects or reduce their effectiveness.
7. Nutritional issues: The patient's ability to tolerate oral intake may be compromised due to her underlying conditions. Malnutrition can weaken the immune system and delay recovery.
8. Pressure injuries: Prolonged bed rest in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure injuries, especially in vulnerable areas such as the sacrum or heels.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition pose several potential complications that need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing VATs and wedge resection for UIP. He has been intubated due to significant oxygen requirements and limited progress over the last few days.
- The patient has hypoxemia, likely due to underlying UIP, overlying AIP/DAD, S. aureus pneumonia/H. flu infection, and PTX.
- The patient is on a planned 14-day course of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for S. aureus and H. flu pneumonia. He is also on a steroid taper for suspected acute exacerbation of IPF and weaning off solumedrol.
- The goal is to achieve an even fluid balance.
- The patient has S. aureus and H. flu pneumonia and will continue with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (D1=[5-29]).
- The patient has a small pneumothorax that appears larger this morning, and the plan is to discuss with thoracics whether to drain it. The concern is that the patient may not tolerate it.
- Rheumatoid arthritis therapies are on hold for now.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction and is currently only on metoprolol 5 mg IV q 6hr. Anticoagulation is deferred.
- The patient requires further evaluation for nutrition, with a scheduled SLP evaluation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and underlying usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection. The patient required intubation due to Staphylococcus aureus and H. flu pneumonia with significant oxygen requirements and limited progress over the last few days.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemia, S. aureus and H. flu pneumonia, pneumothorax, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic dysfunction. The patient is on a 14-day course of antibiotics (Pip-tazo) with planned transition to Bactrim PO for completion. The patient is also on a steroid taper for acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia (AE-IPF), changed to prednisone 10 mg PO daily. The goal is to achieve an even fluid balance today.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening hypoxemia due to underlying UIP and overlying acute interstitial pneumonia/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), as well as the effects of S. aureus pneumonia and H. flu. The presence of pneumothorax may lead to recurrent episodes or worsening respiratory distress. Rheumatoid arthritis therapies are currently on hold. The patient's atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction require further management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old individual with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing ventilation after undergoing VATs and wedge resection. They have underlying UIP and are currently intubated due to significant oxygen requirement and limited progress over the last few days. The patient has been diagnosed with S. aureus pneumonia and H. flu infection, as well as pneumothorax. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are planned to be moved to home hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: Multifactorial due to underlying UIP, AIP/DAD, S. aureus pneumonia, and H. flu infection.
2. Pneumothorax: Small pneumothorax that needs to be managed with a change to a Heimlich valve.
3. S. aureus and H. flu PNA: Ongoing antibiotic treatment is necessary.
4. Rheumatoid arthritis: Medications for RA are on hold for now.
5. Atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction: Treatment involves stopping metoprolol and continuing with PO digoxin. Anticoagulation is deferred.
6. Nutrition: The patient is able to take puree and requires nutritional support.
7. Code status: DNR/DNI.
8. Disposition: ICU, planned to be moved to home hospice care tomorrow."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxic respiratory failure after undergoing VATS and lingula/LLL biopsy. She has undergone a tracheostomy due to worsening pneumothorax. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving 6 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. She is also being treated with IV heparin for prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and bactrim for pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis, for which she is taking Humira and Methotrexate. She also has a history of diastolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if not properly managed. It is important to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and adjust the level of oxygen as tolerated.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient had a worsening pneumothorax that required thoracics placement. Close monitoring of her chest X-ray is necessary to ensure that the pneumothorax does not recur.
3. Infection: The patient is being treated with bactrim for pneumonia. Regular follow-up of sputum cultures is important to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.
4. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medications (Humira and Methotrexate) have been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous VATS with lingula/LLL biopsy showing UIP. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and worsening pneumothorax. The patient has been placed on suction and is currently on water seal with plans to go home on water seal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient continues to be on 6L NC oxygen, and the plan is to titrate as tolerated. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory status if the pneumothorax does not improve or recurs.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being continued on digoxin for rate control and restarting metoprolol 12.5 mg po TID for rate control. There is a risk of further cardiac complications if the atrial fibrillation is not adequately managed.
3. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's methotrexate and humira have been held. There is a possibility of flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms due to the discontinuation of these medications.
4. Macrocytic anemia: The etiology of the macrocytic anemia is unclear. It could be due to anemia of chronic disease or potentially related to methotrexate therapy. Trending Hct and guaiac all stools will help monitor the condition.
5. Congestive heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing ventilation support for severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. The patient also has underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and has undergone surgical procedures such as VATS and wedge resection. The patient's condition has been unstable with limited progress in the last few days, experiencing hypoxemia due to underlying interstitial lung disease, acute injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane, and pneumonia. The patient has developed pneumothorax and atrial fibrillation. The patient's rheumatoid arthritis treatment is currently on hold. The patient's family prefers home hospice care, and the plan is to transition there soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: Due to underlying interstitial lung disease, acute injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane, and pneumonia.
2. Pneumothorax: Increased size on pneumostat may require further intervention.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is already on medication for this condition, but it can potentially lead to complications if not managed properly.
4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient is being tried on metoprolol (crushed in apple sauce) and continues on PO digoxin.
5. Rheumatoid Arthritis: Treatment for RA is currently on hold.
6. Aspiration: The patient appears to be aspirating Bactrim el"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection, who now requires intubation due to significant oxygen requirements and limited progress in the last few days. The patient has underlying underlying interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (UIP), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP)/diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and possible influenza. The patient also has a pneumothorax on the left.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: Multifactorial, likely due to underlying UIP, overlying AIP/DAD, S. aureus pneumonia/H. flu, and PTX.
   - Continue piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for 14 days as planned.
   - Switch to Bactrim PO for completion of 14-day course, but crushing the pill in apple sauce due to apparent aspiration.
   - Remain on steroid taper for unknown adverse effects of IPF.
   - Change to prednisone 10 mg PO daily.

2. S. aureus and H. flu PNA:
   - Continue abx as above.

3. Pneumothorax: Increased size on pneumostat (unclear if applied correctly, possibly briefly open to room).
   - Retry the pneumostat today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure due to UIP and refractory pneumothorax. The patient has completed a course of Bactrim for MSSA pneumonia and is being discharged home with hospice care. He is on morphine for pain relief and will continue with 6L NC oxygen, titrating as tolerated. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and will continue on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control. His nutritional plan includes pleasure feeds, and he will be discharged with prescriptions for Zydis and PO haldol, as well as oral morphine for hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration despite being placed on NC oxygen and nebs. The chest tube will need to be managed appropriately to prevent recurrent pneumothorax.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation, and he is on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control. However, there is still a risk of arrhythmias and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure exacerbation.

3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a pre-existing condition of diastolic heart failure, which may worsen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection for upper lobe infiltrate with Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae pneumonia. The patient required intubation due to significant oxygen requirements and limited progress over the last few days.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to underlying underlying interstitial pneumonia (UIP), acute interstitial pneumonitis/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PTX).
2. Aspiration: The patient appears to be aspirating Bactrim, an antibiotic given for Staphylococcus aureus and H. influenzae pneumonia. The plan is to crush the pill in apple sauce for easier swallowing.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has an increased size of pneumothorax on the pneumostat, which may not be applied correctly. The system may have been briefly open to room air.
4. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis therapies are currently on hold.
5. Atrial Fibrillation and Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction. A trial of metoprolol (low dose) crushed in apple"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and underlying usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and wedge resection. The patient required intubation due to severe oxygenation issues and limited progress over the last few days.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement is significant, and there are multiple factors contributing to hypoxemia, including underlying UIP, acute interstitial pneumonitis/diffuse alveolar damage (AIP/DAD), Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and H. flu infection.

2. S. aureus and H. flu pneumonia: The patient has been receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for these infections.

3. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's treatment for RA is currently on hold.

4. Atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction: The patient is being managed with crushed metoprolol in apple sauce (low dose), continued PO digoxin, and deferred anticoagulation.

5. Nutrition: The patient is able to take puree and receives pleasure feeds. They require further nutritional support.

6. Code status: The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI) code status.

7. Disposition: The patient is being discharged home to hosp"
