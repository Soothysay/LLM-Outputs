","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to EtOH cirrhosis. He presented with acute onset altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Paracentesis was performed at midnight. The patient has been sedated with propofol and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 60%. Physical examination reveals faint scleral icterus, dry mucous membranes, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, and a carotid bruit on the left side. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/62 to 151/83 mmHg, respiratory rate between 9-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Laboratory results show elevated ammonia levels, prolonged PTT and INR, and evidence of portal vein thrombosis on ultrasound. The patient's MELD score is 28. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to AMS.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Portal vein thrombosis.
4. Infection (negative serum and urine toxicology, but panculture will be done to rule out other sources of infection).
5. Liver failure.
6. Renal insufficiency.
7. Depression.
8. Malnutrition (NPO for now, low Na diet when extubated).
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
10. Stress ulcers.
11. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Please note that this is a summary and not an exhaustive analysis of the patient's condition. Further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to EtOH cirrhosis. He presented with acute onset altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has an elevated ammonia level, which supports the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. An ultrasound revealed a new portal vein thrombus. The patient's respiratory failure appears to be secondary to his altered mental status. He is being treated with lactulose, rifaximin, and other interventions aimed at managing his conditions. The patient is undergoing a liver transplant evaluation, with a MELD score of 28. His CRI is at baseline, and he is also being treated for depression. He is NPO for now and will have a low Na diet upon extubation. His code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can lead to further deterioration of the patient's mental status and potential development of severe complications such as seizures or respiratory failure.

2. Portal vein thrombosis: The presence of a new portal vein thrombus increases the risk of further thrombotic events and can potentially lead to complications such as variceal bleeding or mesenteric ischemia.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to his altered mental status. If not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to EtOH (alcohol) cirrhosis. He presents with acute onset altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been placed on invasive ventilation, paracentesis, and an NG (nasogastric) tube has been inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient appears to be experiencing respiratory failure secondary to altered mental status (AMS). There is a need to wean down FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) and change to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as tolerated. Frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) monitoring should be done to assess respiratory function.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of ESLD and presentation with AMS, hepatic encephalopathy is suspected. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin administration. Diagnostic paracentesis will be performed to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as a precipitant.

3. Infection: Serum tox screen is negative, but urinary tox screen will be checked. Pneumonia is being ruled out by panculture and chest X-ray. Infection can act as a precipitant for hepatic encephalopathy and should be treated promptly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to EtOH cirrhosis, presenting with acute onset altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He has been intubated and is currently receiving sedation. The patient's vitals show tachycardia in the teens with blood pressures in the 80s-90s. He received three boluses with improvement in vitals. Suctioning bright red blood from the mouth and throat was noted, which appeared to be traumatic in nature.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to EtOH cirrhosis. He presented with acute onset altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He has been intubated and sedated, and is currently receiving lactulose and rifaximin for his condition. The patient also has a new portal vein thrombosis, as confirmed by ultrasound. His vital signs are stable, but he is at risk for complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is being evaluated for liver transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): SBP is a common and potentially serious complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The patient's ascites needs to be monitored regularly, and he should be on prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): HRS is a type of kidney failure that can occur in patients with advanced liver disease. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and he may require specific treatment for HRS.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain disorder caused by liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, changes in behavior, and even coma. The patient is already receiving treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, including lact"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a portal vein thrombus seen on ultrasound. A CT-abdomen with contrast was performed, which showed a patent portal vein and a mass in the liver. The patient was extubated and experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 27.4 to 24.2. A type and screen were sent, and two units of blood were cross-matched. Stool guaiac was negative.

Vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate between 81-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/57 to 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,157 mL and total output of 4,130 mL, with urine output of 1,130 mL and stool output of 3,000 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a face tent, with standby ventilator mode and spontaneous Vt of 488 mL. Oxygen delivery is at 50% FiO2, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and SpO2 at 99%.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and slightly elevated platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged man with a history of ESLD due to EtOH cirrhosis. He presented with acute onset altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 99/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been intubated and sedated. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication in patients with liver disease.
2. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has an ultrasound finding of a new portal vein thrombus. This can lead to further complications such as liver dysfunction or potential embolization to other organs.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have respiratory failure secondary to altered mental status. Weaning off the ventilator and providing adequate oxygenation support will be crucial.
4. Infection: Despite negative serum and urine toxicology results, there is a concern for infection as a precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy. Panculture will be done to rule out other sources of infection.
5. ESLD: The patient is undergoing a liver transplant evaluation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to alcohol cirrhosis. He presented with acute onset altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status has since resolved, and he is now extubated and on room air. He is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and his condition is being monitored. The patient has been placed on the transplant list and received albumin yesterday. A new liver lesion was detected on CT scan, which will be further evaluated. The patient also has hypernatremia, chronic renal insufficiency, depression, and is taking medications for these conditions. He has good oral intake and is on a low-sodium diet. The patient's vitals are stable, and his labs are within normal limits. No infectious etiology has been identified, and he is not experiencing respiratory distress. The patient's code status is full code, and the plan is to consult with the liver team regarding the new liver lesion finding."
