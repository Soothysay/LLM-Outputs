   Chief Complaint: 82 yo with a hx of DM, CAD s/p CABG [**2152**] redo [**10/2171**]
   (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-Diag), CHF (EF 51%), and EtOH abuse, admitted to
   OSH for shortness of breath and chest pain and transferred to the [**Hospital1 19**]
   for cardiac catheterization that was aborted [**1-29**] delirium and agitation
   on [**1-22**] until [**1-25**]: Promus LIMA to LAD, on RHC.
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-5**]
   -Patient conversant, knows he is in [**Hospital 23**] Hospital in [**2182-1-28**].
   Patient angry about restraints and attention from RNs.  Mental status
   markedly improved.
   [**2-4**]
   - Refusing POs after olanzapine ; given lower dose (22 u ) NPH and no
   humalog for bld gluc 121 this AM
   - started standing low dose seroquel at 7pm, per [**Female First Name (un) **]; will increase
   dose if needed
   - re-consulted Geriatrics for delirium --> seroquel QHS, and consider
   starting Neurontin low dose tomorrow night (pt was on neurontin at home
   previously, stopped end of [**Month (only) **] for some reason)
   - bradycardia down to 30s w junctional rhythm, then HR back to 80s
   - febrile, blood and urine cultures, stat CXR
   - transferred back to CCU
   - ABG shows pH 7.43 paCO2 55, paO2 75 despite tachypnea
   - diuresing well; also given a dose of IV acetazolamide in setting of
   metabolic alkalosis; clinically respiratory status looks improved,
   breathing ~28/min (rather than >40)
   - ABG 4:30pm showed improved pCO2
   - given nighttime olanzapine ~9pm (had started becoming awake/agitated
   again around 8am but not too agitated)-- (didnt use seroquel as planned
   b/c he didnt seem like he could swallow reliably); gave him the
   antipsychotic to help him rest --> appeared to work for a while, but
   nursing thought it was just because he tired himself out...
   - 3am pt became more agitated kicking around, trying to get out of bed
   to go to work; nurse didnt feel zyprexa would work anyway; couldnt get
   an ekg to check QT either b/c pt so agitated; put him on leg restraints
   (only while nurse was in room w him)
   - 5:30am screaming out for help constantly ; gave 2.5mg olanzapine 6am;
   will need ekg when calm

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo with hx of CABG, DM, etoh abuse, transferred for cardiac
   catheterization after ICU admission for respiratory failure during
   which time he had an elevated Troponin and was intubated for hypoxic
   respiratory failure and DTs.
   .
   #. NSTEMI/CAD: Patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are
   concerning for unstable angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of
   NSTEMI in the setting of Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are
   available from the OSH. Serum troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04.
   Cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the SVG-OM1 &
   LIMA-LAD grafts, but patient agitation during procedure prevented
   completion of cardiac catheterization. Currently, patient has a new
   stent in the SVG-OM1 that is partially expanded. He is awaiting
   catheterization on [**1-24**] for evaluation and treatment of the LIMA
   occlusion. Currently, he is chest pain free, but refusing EKG.
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Plavix 75mg daily
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Heparin gtt
   - No Integrillin given current Troponin
   .
   #. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: CHF with EF51% as assessed by nuclear
   imaging at OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 25**]. Patient with persistent fluid overload
   on admission, but he was not pre-hydrated in anticipation of cardiac
   catheterization. On transfer, patient demonstrates mild respiratory
   distress and O2 requirement, limited clinical exam suggests fluid
   overload.
   - Lasix 40mg IV x 1, repeat PRN
   - O2 by NC
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   .
   # Agitation/Mental status changes: Patient's cardiac catheterization
   aborted [**1-29**] agitation that was refractory to significant doses of
   Haldol. Per patient's wife and [**Name (NI) 755**] Hospital records, patient has
   been confused and agitated since his hospitalization at [**Location (un) 755**]. He
   pulled out his Foley prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 19**] and his wife
   reports that he was paranoid at [**Location (un) 755**], insisting that the FBI was out
   to get him. At home, however, his wife states that he is not confused,
   but does exhibit short-term memory impairments. As patient has been
   attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines, and is not fully
   oriented despite repeated verbal reorientation, his primary process
   appears to be agitation with some minor component of dementia/delirium.
   Patient also takes Ativan PO PRN at home, so he may have some component
   of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - Psych consult, recommending 0.5 to 1mg q4H:PRN agitation
   - Will try to avoid Haldol/Zyprexa as it will further prolong QT
   interval
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Minimize lines & tubes
   - Preserve sleep wake cycles
   - OOB for meals
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient in and out of AF in the CCU, but no report of h/o of
   AF. He has also been persistently tachycardic, despite having a regular
   rhythm on admission. This may be agitation paired with diuresis, but
   will continue to monitor closely.
   - On telemetry
   - Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO BID
   .
   #. DM: Will continue NPH & insulin sliding scale from OSH.
   - NPH 20u [**Hospital1 7**] & Humalog sliding scale
   - Gabapentin 600mg PO qHS
   .
   #. EtOH abuse: Patient with h/o DT's with EtOH withdrawal, most
   recently at [**Location (un) 755**] prior to hospital transfer. Drinks a pint of
   whiskey a day at home, but his last drink was prior to admission to
   [**Location (un) 755**] on [**1-7**]. He was maintained on a CIWA scale during that
   hospitalization, but also takes Ativan 1mg PO BID:PRN at home so he
   could have some degree of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
   - IV Ativan 0.5mg-1mg q4H:PRN
   - SW consult
   .
   #. HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily.
   .
   #. HTN:
   -Continue Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
   -Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO BID
   .
   #. GERD:
   - Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
   .
   #. Anxiety/Depression:
   - Per psychiatry, appears to be a distant diagnosis.
   - Continue to observe
   .
   #. Hx of TIA: Short-term left hand and leg weakness, now resolved. No
   focal neurologic deficits on admission.
   .
   #. FEN: Cardiac/diabetic, MVI
   .
   #. Access: PIV, right subclavian line (will plan to d/c when patient
   cooperative)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol abuse. He was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization after having a DES procedure to the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD). The patient experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure and agitation, resulting in intubation.

24-hour events include:
- The patient was started on low-dose seroquel at 7 pm due to agitation.
- A geriatric consult was re-established for delirium, and seroquel was given at bedtime. Neurontin at a low dose was considered for the next night as the patient had been taking it previously but stopped recently.
- Bradycardia was observed, which improved after administering IV acetazolamide in the setting of metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient became febrile, and blood and urine cultures were ordered. A stat chest X-ray was also performed.
- The patient was transferred back to the coronary care unit (CCU).
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.43, paCO2 55, and paO2 75 despite tachypnea.
- Diuresis was ongoing, and the patient was given a dose of IV acetazolamide due to metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient's respiratory status appeared improved, with a breathing rate of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization after experiencing unstable angina and a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). During the procedure, the patient's agitation prevented the completion of the catheterization, and he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in the saphenous vein graft (SVG)-OM1 and left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-left anterior descending (LAD) grafts.

Since admission, the patient has been agitated and has required restraints and chemical restraints. His mental status has been fluctuating, and he has shown signs of confusion and agitation. Brain imaging revealed multiple new lesions likely secondary to catheter procedures with emboli.

The patient also presented with acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), as evidenced by fluid overload and subsequent hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has been diuresed and is currently on a regimen of home lasix, oxygen therapy, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril.

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, which will continue with NPH insulin and insulin sliding scale from the outside hospital. The patient is also on gabapentin for neuropath"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, diabetes mellitus, and ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization after experiencing unstable angina and suspected NSTEMI. The patient underwent a procedure to place a drug-eluting stent in the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery grafts. The patient's mental status improved initially but worsened as the day progressed. He developed hypotension and appeared somnolent after receiving 40mg of torsemide, which was later decreased to 20mg daily. The patient also has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to catheter procedures with emboli. He requires restraints and chemical restraints intermittently due to agitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient's agitation and altered mental status may lead to further complications such as falls, self-injury, or injury to healthcare providers.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's symptoms of fluid overload and hypoxemic respiratory failure indicate worsening congestive heart failure. If left untreated, it can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or even cardiac arrest.
3. NSTEMI/CAD: Although the patient's symptoms and troponin elevation suggest NSTEMI, the incomplete cardiac catheterization and stent placement may increase the risk of recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes needs close monitoring, and any fluctuations in blood glucose levels can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
5. Ethanol Withdrawal: Considering the patient's history of ethanol abuse, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can manifest as seizures, delirium tremens, or autonomic instability.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which is a common and potentially severe infection in critically ill patients.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization after experiencing unstable angina and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) to the left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-left anterior descending (LAD) graft and saphenous vein graft (SVG)-OM1. However, due to agitation during the procedure, the catheterization was not completed.

The patient has been agitated and delirious since admission, requiring restraints and chemical restraints. He also has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to the catheterization procedures with emboli. His mental status has been hypoactive during the day and hyperactive at night. The patient responded to Seroquel for a few hours last night, and his QTc interval was around 450. He was also started on low-dose Neurontin but discontinued due to no improvement.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. His physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, trace lower extremity edema, and an erythematous and warm left anterior lower shin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and elevated troponin levels. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and stenting of the saphenous vein graft (SVG)-OM1 and left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-LAD for 95% stenoses.

During his ICU stay, the patient experienced several medical complications. He had difficulty falling asleep and became agitated, requiring sedation. He also developed hypotension after bowel movement and showed signs of delirium or sun-downing behavior. The patient had inverted T waves in the anterior leads on ECG, which was similar to his pre-PCI ECG. His vital signs fluctuated, and he required potassium repletion twice. He was on multiple medications including heparin sodium, lansoprazole, metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, and others.

The patient's lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. His blood glucose levels were also elevated. Other lab results indicated abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function. The patient's urine analysis showed occasional bacteria, and his CXR was pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and elevated troponin levels after undergoing cardiac catheterization. The patient also experienced delirium and agitation, which were managed with Haldol and quetiapine. He developed cellulitis in his left ankle, which was treated with cephalexin.

The patient's medical history includes acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 51%, persistent pulmonary edema following non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), agitation/mental status changes, cellulitis, NSTEMI/CAD, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia, hypotensive episodes, anxiety/depression, history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and femoral-popliteal peripheral vascular disease.

The patient is currently on various medications including ASA, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, lisinopril, torsemide, lansoprazole, and others. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breath"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and elevated troponin levels after undergoing cardiac catheterization. The patient had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He also has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 51%. The patient is currently agitated and experiencing mental status changes, including delirium and sundowning. Other medical conditions include rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, anxiety/depression, and a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins, diuretics, insulin, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CABG, DM, and recent NSTEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure during ICU admission may recur, leading to pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.
3. Delirium and mental status changes: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and elevated Troponin levels. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and PTCA with stenting of the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD for 95% stenoses. The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium/sun-downing, hypotension, inverted T waves on ECG, and difficulty falling asleep with agitation requiring sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization and elevated Troponin levels suggest unstable angina or NSTEMI. Ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.
2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 51%. Persistent pulmonary edema following NSTEMI and PCI indicates acute exacerbation of CHF.
3. Agitation/Mental status changes: Delirium/sun-downing with psych input suggesting daytime activity, reorientation, and infectious workup. Monitoring QT interval, frequent reorientation, minimizing lines and tubes, preserving sleep-wake cycles, and out-of-bed activities are important.
4. Rhythm: The patient is in and out of AF in the CCU. Close monitoring is necessary due to persistent tachycardia, despite having a regular rhythm on admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, DM, and etoh abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and elevated Troponin levels during cardiac catheterization. The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and delirium/tremors (DTs). The patient underwent PTCA and stenting of the SVG-OM1 & LIMA-LAD for 95% stenoses.

Key events from the 24-hour period include:
- The patient required repleting potassium twice.
- The patient had difficulty falling asleep and became agitated, requiring sedation.
- Morning assessment showed that the patient was conversant and aware of his location in the hospital. However, the patient was angry about restraints and attention from nurses. Mental status improved markedly.
- At 2 pm, the patient had a bowel movement and developed hypotension, appearing somnolent. ECG demonstrated diffusely inverted T waves in anterior leads, reminiscent of the ECG on the morning prior to PCI, which also showed T-wave inversions. A 250cc bolus of normal saline resolved the pressures.
- The dose of metoprolol was decreased from 25 to 12.5mg TID, and lisinopril was decreased from 5 to 2.5mg QD. Torsemide was changed from 40mg QD to 20mg [**Hospital1 7**] to allow for holding medication if the diuretic was involved in the hypotensive episode.

Other medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium, acetaminophen, albuterol, artificial tears, aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, dextrose 50%, docusate, follic acid, gabapentin, heparin, insulin, ipratropium bromide, lisinopril, metoprolol tartrate, milk of magnesia, miconazole powder 2%, quetiapine fumarate, senna, thiamine, torsemide, and others.

   # Altered Mental Status/ Delirium:
   Alternating Hypoactive and Hyperactive Delirium.  Appears improved
   today, less hypoactive.  The patient has been agitated since the
   outside hospital, likely delirious since presentation from outside
   hospital. He has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to
   cath procedures with emboli.  Not on restraints this AM.  Has responded
   to seroquel for a couple of hours last night and required a dose of
   haldol.  Geriatrics is following.
   - appreciate geriatrics recs
   - re-check QTc today and increase seroquel dose and continue prn Haldol
   - continue frequent reorientation
   - minimize lines and tubes as possible ; continues w foley catheter and
   telemetry and requires restraints intermittently, particularly at night
   - sleep wake cycles

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft), diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, and other medical conditions. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization following a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent stent placement. The patient's current health issues include altered mental status/delirium, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, hyperlipidemia (HLD), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety/depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening delirium: The patient is experiencing alternating hypoactive and hyperactive delirium, which may require further evaluation and management by the geriatrics team. Frequent reorientation and minimizing lines and tubes can help reduce agitation.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is about even in the last 24 hours, mildly negative. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid overload, especially considering his CHF.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient previously required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential.
4. Cardiac complications: As the patient had an NSTEMI"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization and subsequently intubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been agitated and likely delirious since admission. He underwent dual endothelialization of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex artery (SVG-OM1).

Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient has been agitated since the outside hospital and is likely delirious since presentation. He has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to cath procedures with emboli. Haldol may be more effective than seroquel for this patient. Need to discuss with [Female First Name] options.

2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appears fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation previously. He continues to have rales and O2 requirement but cannot tolerate further diuresis. Fluid balance is about even in the last 24 hours, mildly negative.

3. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization are"

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status/delirium, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, hyperlipidemia (HLD), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety/depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has been agitated and likely delirious since admission. The multiple new lesions in his brain are likely secondary to cath procedures with emboli. It is important to continue frequent reorientation, minimize lines, minimize restraints, correct sleep-wake cycles, and keep the patient out of bed as much as possible.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient appeared fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation previously. Continuing to have rales and O2 requirement, but the patient's blood pressure cannot tolerate further diuresis. Fluid balance is about even in the last 24 hours, mildly negative. It is important to continue 20mg torsemide"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization and subsequently transferred to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and agitation. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium and altered mental status. He underwent coronary stenting procedures and is currently experiencing ongoing symptoms consistent with NSTEMI/CAD. The patient also has acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an estimated ejection fraction of 30-35%. Other medical conditions include diabetes, ethanol abuse, hyperlipidemia (HLD), hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anxiety/depression, and an allergy to sulfa drugs. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, torsemide, ranitidine, NPH insulin, and Humalog insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's agitation and altered mental status indicate delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, injury, and worsening of other medical conditions.
2. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing myocardial ischemia, potentially leading to further cardiac complications if not managed appropriately.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization and experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. The patient has been agitated and likely delirious since presentation.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 (SVG-OM1) and left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending (LIMA-LAD) grafts. A drug-eluting stent (DES) was placed in the SVG-OM1 and LIMA-LAD grafts. He is currently free of chest pain, and his cardiac enzyme levels are stable.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including altered mental status/delirium, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cellulitis in the left lower extremity, NSTEMI/coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety/depression.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening delirium, exacerbation of CHF, progression of cellulitis, development of further cardiac issues such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol withdrawal, hypertension, and gastrointestinal"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. The patient was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization and subsequently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Altered mental status/delirium: The patient has been agitated since admission and likely delirious since presentation from the outside hospital. His delirium has improved, but he still experiences intermittent hyperactive delirium, especially at night. The patient has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to cath procedures with emboli. He is being treated with increased doses of seroquel (100mg qhs and 25mg qam) and will not be able to get psychiatric placement. Frequent re-orientation is recommended, along with minimizing lines and restraints, correcting sleep-wake cycles, and out-of-bed ambulation as much as possible.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appeared fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation previously. He continues to have rales and O2 requirement but does not complain of shortness"

   respiratory failure and continued agitation.
   # Altered Mental Status/ Delirium:
   Much improved. Hypoactive delirium improved, now just has intermittent
   hyperactive delirium, mostly at night, starts in afternoon and becomes
   worse through night.  The patient has been agitated since the outside
   hospital, likely delirious since presentation from outside hospital. He
   has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to cath
   procedures with emboli.  Did not require four-point restraints last
   night.  Given increased 100mg dose of seroquel, .  Per psych, will not
   be able to get [**Female First Name (un) **]-Psych placement.  QTc normal on telemetry.
   - appreciate geriatrics recs and psych recs
   - continue seroquel qhs and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] re-address after 48hrs on this
   regimen if he continues to not improve.
   - cont frequent re-orientation

   overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation
   previously.  Continues to have rales and O2 requirement but does blood
   pressure cannot tolerate further diuresis.  Fluid balance about even in
   last 24 hrs, mildly negative.  Does not have O2 requirement anymore,
   and does not complain of shortness of breath.
   - continue 20mg torsemide daily to keep him even

   angina and enzymes at OSH were suggestive of  NSTEMI in the setting of
   Troponin elevation. However, no EKGs are available from the OSH. Serum
   troponin on admission to [**Hospital1 19**] was 0.04. Cardiac catheterization

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a blocked artery. The patient was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization and subsequently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and agitation.

The patient's medical conditions and plans include:

1. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved, with intermittent hyperactivity at night. He remains agitated and has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to catheterization procedures with emboli. The plan includes increasing the dose of seroquel, frequent reorientation, minimizing lines and restraints, correcting sleep-wake cycles, out-of-bed activities, and screening for rehabilitation.

2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-35%. He appears fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation previously. Currently, he still has rales but does not require supplemental oxygen. The plan includes continuing torsemide daily and metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg TID as tolerated by blood pressure.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has a rash with scabs on the left lower extremity, which does not appear to be as inflamed currently. However"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery (LIMA-LAD) graft. The patient was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current condition includes hypoactive delirium, which has improved but still exhibits intermittent hyperactive delirium, especially at night. There are new lesions in the brain likely secondary to catheter procedures with emboli. The patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the obtuse marginal 1 (OM1) and LIMA-LAD grafts, but the procedure was incomplete due to patient agitation. The patient has been started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.

The patient also has a history of cellulitis in the left lower extremity, which is currently being treated with antibiotics. The patient's glycemic control has been managed with NPH insulin and sliding scale insulin. Alcohol withdrawal is being monitored, and there is concern for chronic alcoholic dementia or Korsakoff syndrome contributing to the overall delirium picture."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, and other comorbidities. The patient was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization and subsequent intubation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and agitation. The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient has been agitated since the outside hospital and likely delirious since presentation. The patient has multiple new lesions in his brain likely secondary to cath procedures with emboli. The patient's delirium improved with an increased dose of Seroquel and will continue with the same dosage. Trazodone may be used to help with sleep. Frequent reorientation, minimizing lines and restraints, correcting sleep-wake cycles, and providing out-of-bed activities are recommended.

2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient appeared fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation previously. The patient continues to have rales and O2 requirement but does not tolerate further diuresis. Fluid balance is about even in the last 24 hours, mildly negative. Torsemide will be continued daily to keep the patient even, and Metoprolol tartrate will be continued at 12.5mg TID as tolerated by blood pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol abuse. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization but required intubation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and agitation. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including altered mental status/delirium, acute on chronic systolic heart failure (CHF), cellulitis in the left lower extremity, and previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/coronary artery disease (CAD). He is also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia (HLD), hypertension (HTN), and anxiety/depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status/delirium is a concern and requires close monitoring. Frequent reorientation and minimizing lines and restraints should help in managing this condition.
2. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient appears to be fluid overloaded but does not tolerate further diuresis. Close monitoring of fluid balance and adjusting diuretic dosage may be necessary.
3. Cellulitis: Although the rash on the left lower extremity seems less inflamed currently, it is important to continue treatment as there is a possibility of worsening or spreading infection.
4. NSTEMI/CAD: The patient's symptoms prior to hospitalization suggest unstable angina, and troponin elevation"

   [**2-13**]
   - increased trazodone to 50mg [**Name (NI) **]
   - PT says Rehab is optimal for patient, though mental status may
   initially worsen on transfer to another facility.  If family prefers to
   take patient home, patient will require 24 hour assist at home, CG for
   all mobility, and assist for sit to stand.  This would require family
   training while patient is in hospital.
   - Spoke w wife over telephone, who prefers patient to be in Rehab IF
   Rehab is <20min away from home but prefers him to be at home if Rehab
   is too far away
   - No vitals overnight to help decrease agitation
   - Security called b/c patient uncooperative, hitting nurse when she
   attempted to give meds, walking around room
   - gave 5mg IV Haldol for agitation ; took HS trazodone at same time and
   was knocked out for no more than 40min, then started trying to get out
   of bed again ; he eventually fell asleep in chair

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), and ethanol abuse. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization and subsequently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been agitated since the outside hospital and is likely delirious. Multiple new lesions in his brain are likely secondary to cath procedures with emboli. The patient's mental status improved after increasing the dose of seroquel. He continues to have intermittent hyperactive delirium, mostly at night, starting in the afternoon and worsening throughout the night.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient's altered mental status/delirium is likely due to multiple factors including ethanol abuse, chronic dementia, or Korsakoff encephalopathy, and recent catheterization procedures with emboli. The patient's delirium has been partially responsive to an increased dose of seroquel. Measures to improve his mental status include frequent reorientation, minimizing lines and restraints, correcting sleep-wake cycles, keeping him out of bed as much as possible, and screening for rehabilitation.

2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 30-35%. He appeared fluid overloaded and had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation previously. Although his blood pressure"
