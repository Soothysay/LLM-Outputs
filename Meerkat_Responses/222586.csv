 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM: No clear etiology for persistant ventricular tachycardia /
   fibrillation. Although cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, this is
   in the setting of repeated defibrillation and in the absence of ECG
   changes. Given known total occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to
   scar tissue or new ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.
   Differential diagnosis for precipitants of VT storm would include
   electrolyte imbalance, new onset heart failure or exacerbation,
   ischemia and drug toxicity / effect. Patient at risk of VT/VF given
   past MI and resulting scar in posterior and infeerior walls.
   -- Continue amiodarone load, pt received 150mg bolus, would continue IV
   load at 1mg/min (60mg/hr) overnight, then reduce to 0.5mg/min (30mg/hr)
   (maximum daily dose 2 gm)
   -- IV Lidocaine with 100mg bolused, continue 2mg drip, monitor mental
   status
   -- Cont low dose Metoprolol to supress ectopy
   -- Trend cardiac enzymes
   -- NPO overnight, will likely need diagnostic cath to rule out active
   ischemia before EP study
   -- EP consult in AM for potential EP study
   -- Continue heparin drip due to stunned myocardium from repeated
   cardioversions
   # CORONARIES:  As above, will need to evaluate for active CAD
   -- Beta blocker
   -- Aspirin
   -- Statin
   # SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, ACUTE VS CHRONIC:  Mildly depressed EF,
   unclear if this is acute change although regional wall motion
   abnormality is consistent with that from [**2127**]. No symptoms of CHF
   - Consider starting ACE-I / long acting beta blocker after procedures
   - Recent echo in [**Month (only) 11**] of this year, pending potential findings would
   consider repeating.
   # VALVULAR DISEASE: Mild AS, Mod MR, pt at risk of flash pulmonary
   edema with VT episodes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and total occlusion of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries. She presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and an electrical storm, which refers to recurrent episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation. The patient underwent cardioversion and was converted into a regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. She is currently being treated with amiodarone, heparin, lidocaine, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VT/VF recurrence: The patient is at high risk for recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation due to her past myocardial infarction and resulting scar in the posterior and inferior walls of the heart.
2. Ischemic insult or new ischemic injury: Given the known total occlusion of the left circumflex artery, there is a possibility of an ischemic insult or new ischemic injury causing a posterior infarct.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient may be at risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which can precipitate arrhythmias.
4. New-onset heart failure or exacerbation: The patient's mildly depressed ejection fraction suggests systolic heart failure, and she may develop or worsen heart failure during her ICU stay.
5. Drug toxicity/toefect: Some of the medications she is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and total occlusion of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries. She presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and an electrical storm. The patient underwent cardioversion and defibrillation, after which she was started on amiodarone, heparin, lidocaine, and metoprolol. Her vital signs have been stable, with a heart rate in the 50s, blood pressure ranging from 89-113 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's mental status was below baseline initially but improved after administration of fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VT Storm: The patient experienced an electrical storm, which is characterized by recurrent and sustained episodes of VT. This condition can lead to hemodynamic instability, decreased cardiac output, and potential arrhythmia-related death if not managed promptly.
2. Ischemic Insult: The patient's history of total occlusion of the LCx raises the possibility of ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury causing a posterior wall myocardial infarction. This can result in further arrhythmia episodes or progression of heart failure.
3. Drug Toxicity/Effect: The patient is receiving multiple antiarrhythmic medications, including amiodarone and lidocaine."

 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM vs SVT (AVNRT w/ abberancy): No clear etiology for
   persistant ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation. Although cardiac
   enzymes are slightly elevated, this is in the setting of repeated
   defibrillation and in the absence of ECG changes. Given known total
   occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to scar tissue or new
   ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.  Also concerned that she
   may have p waves present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia.
   She has also responded to low voltage defibrillation.
   -- Continue amiodarone, pt received 150mg bolus, would reduce to
   0.5mg/min (30mg/hr) (maximum daily dose 2 gm)
   -- IV Lidocaine with 100mg bolused, continue 2mg drip, monitor mental
   status
   -- Cont low dose Metoprolol to supress ectopy
   -- Trend cardiac enzymes
   -- NPO overnight, will likely need diagnostic cath to rule out active
   ischemia before EP study
   -- EP consult in AM for potential EP study, may required cardiac cath
   prior
   -- Continue heparin drip due to stunned myocardium from repeated
   cardioversions
   # CORONARIES:  As above, will need to evaluate for active CAD
   -- Beta blocker
   -- Aspirin
   -- Statin
   #Elevated cardiac enzymes
 CK highly elevated compared to CKMB and

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and total occlusion of the left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA). She presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm. The patient underwent defibrillation and conversion to a regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. She was started on amiodarone, lidocaine, and metoprolol drips.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished, and her mental status is attentive and pleasant.

The patient has right lower extremity edema of 1+ and left lower extremity edema of 1+. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, along with a holosystolic murmur at the base. The respiratory examination shows basilar crackles bilaterally. The abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, platelet count of 215 K/uL"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM vs SVT (AVNRT w/ abberancy): No clear etiology for
   persistent ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation. Although cardiac
   enzymes are slightly elevated, this is in the setting of repeated
   defibrillation and in the absence of ECG changes. Given known total
   occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to scar tissue or new
   ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.  Also concerned that she
   may have p waves present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia.
   She has also responded to low voltage defibrillation. Cath showed
   chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ. EP substrate ablation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of two-vessel coronary artery disease and total occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA). She presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and an electrical storm. 

The patient underwent an electrophysiological (EP) study with substrate ablation, but was unable to induce sustained VT. However, non-sustained VT originating from the inferior septum and base was observed. It is planned to place an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) first thing tomorrow.

During the ablation, the patient became hypoxic and required nasal high-flow oxygen therapy for a short time. She also developed angina, which responded to sublingual nitroglycerin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 52-81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/51 to 130/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient has mild right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema, both rated as 1+. Physical examination reveals a 3-7/6 holosystolic murmur at the base, along with basilar crackles in the lungs and soft, non-t"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient did well yesterday in cath demonstrating non-obstructed LAD and
   no change in anatomy of the CTO LCx and RCA. Then to EP for substrate
   ablation as they were unable to induce VT. Lidocaine weaned off and the
   patient remains on Amio 200 mg Qd with metoprolol 25 mg TID. Patient
   back to EP lab for ICD placement later today. Will plan on discharge
   tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view.

   on:[**2139-1-2**] 05:54 PM ------
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and total occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA). She presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and an electrical storm. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed chronic occlusion of the RCA and circumflex artery. An electrophysiological (EP) study was performed, but they were unable to induce sustained VT. Substrate ablation was done, and the patient will return for ICD placement. She has been on amiodarone and metoprolol, and her cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury due to total occlusion of LCx.
2. Posterior infarct.
3. Wide complex tachycardia with possible presence of p waves.
4. Muscle damage from defibrillation.
5. Acute vs chronic systolic heart failure.
6. Mild aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).
7. Risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
8. Possible need for an ACE inhibitor and long-acting beta-blocker after procedures.
9. Repeat echocardiogram pending potential findings.
10. Close monitoring of volume status due to risk of flash pulmonary edema."
