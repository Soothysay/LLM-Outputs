   Plan:
   # S/P PROSTATECTOMY POST OP CARE:
   Pt is s/p suprapubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer with multiple
   bouts of urinary retention (partial prostatectomy with plans to have
   radition therapy in future), EBL 1500cc.  Rec'd 6L IVF and 2uPRBC.
   -Has a 3 way foley w/ cbi- titrate to light pink and hand irrigate for
   clots prn per urology
   -patient is at risk for RP bleed - will check q6hr hct, maintain active
   type and screen, 2 large bore IVs
   -hct is 25.5 down from 36 at baseline-  this drop in hct is expected
   with 1500cc of blood loss in addition to 6L of fluids
   -tx for hct < 23
   -hemodynamically stable
   -f/u urology recs
   -continue D5LR per urology @ 150cc / hr
   .
   # DIFFICULT AIRWAY: given difficult airway will leave intubated
   overnight, the patient has no known CAD but has HTN and DM so may have
   some diastolic dysfunction or systolic heart failure and may need some
   diuresis prior to extubation.
   -no cuff leak, 5x attempts at intubation so likely has some upper
   airway trauma, will need to evaluate for cuff leak prior to planned
   extubation, also may need laryngoscopy prior to extubation
   -maintain on pressure support overnight, keep on propofol and wake up
   in a.m. to assess MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1398**]
   -CXR now and in a.m.
   -will give decadron 4mg IV x 1
   .
   # DM: will hold oral hypoglycemics, A1C was 10% in [**Month (only) **], had been as
   high as 13% in the past.
   -monitor fingersticks q 6hrs and treat w/ sliding scale insulin,
   -NPO for now
   .
   # HTN: will hold lisinopril for now given risk of bleed.
   -start captopril in a.m. if BP okay.
   -1st set of cardiac enzymes negative, no need to rule out for MI, EKG
   without ischemic changes.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: baseline normal WBC count.  Will send blood cultures,
   u/a and urine culture, CXR w/o infiltrate, sputum culture, and will
   trend fever curve.
   -likely stress response to surgery / large amount of bleeding but will
   monitor for infection
   -trend leukocytosis, add on diff
   -if diarrhea send C diff (did get 1x dose of levoflox prior to surgery)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes and prostate cancer who underwent a suprapubic prostatectomy due to multiple bouts of urinary retention. He experienced significant blood loss during the surgery (1500cc) and received 6 liters of intravenous fluids and 2 units of packed red blood cells. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an input of 881 mL and an output of 600 mL since midnight.

The patient is receiving propofol at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient has been given a 3-way Foley catheter for bladder irrigation, and the plan is to titrate the irrigation to light pink and perform hand irrigation for clots as needed per urology. The patient is at risk for retroperitoneal bleed, so his hemoglobin (Hct) will be checked every 6 hours, and an active type and screen will be maintained. The patient is also on 2 large bore IVs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes and prostate cancer who underwent prostatectomy. He presented with 1.5 liters of estimated blood loss and difficulty intubation, leading to his admission to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient developed infiltrate, fever, and hypotension, suggestive of sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He was started on antibiotics and central lines were placed. His tachycardia is likely due to infection or sepsis. The patient also has a history of urinary retention and received suprapubic prostatectomy. He received blood transfusions in the OR and after arriving in the ICU. The urology recommendations include discontinuing catheterization and monitoring hemoglobin levels every 6 hours. The patient is at risk for retroperitoneal bleed, so he will be monitored with type and cross-match, and transfused for hemoglobin levels below 23. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with infiltrate, fever, and hypotension suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and radiographic findings indicate pneumonia, which can worsen if not appropriately managed.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of prostatectomy and the use of anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding complications, including retroperitoneal bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes and prostate cancer who underwent a prostatectomy. He presented with difficult intubation and was sent to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 101/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has received furosemide for diuresis and is expected to stay intubated overnight due to a difficult airway. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficult Airway: The patient has a difficult airway, which may pose challenges during extubation. This could lead to complications such as airway obstruction or the need for reintubation.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid input, including 2,419 mL of IV fluids and 276 mL of blood products. However, his fluid balance is negative (-605 mL) and he does not appear fluid overloaded on examination or chest radiograph. Close monitoring is required to prevent fluid overload and associated complications.

3. Bleeding: The patient had a significant amount of estimated blood loss during surgery (1.5 L) and received blood transfusions in the operating room and after arrival in the ICU. He is at risk for postoperative bleeding, and his hemoglobin levels should be closely monitored.

4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL. Blood cultures, urinalysis, urine culture, sputum culture, and a fever curve are planned to monitor for infection. Close observation for signs of infection is necessary.

5. Diabetic Complications: The patient has diabetes and is on hold for oral hypoglycemics. He will be monitored with fingerstick glucose measurements every 6 hours and treated with sliding scale insulin. Strict glycemic control is important to prevent diabetic complications.

6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on lisinopril. However, lisinopril is being held due to the risk of bleeding. If the patient's blood pressure remains elevated, captopril will be started in the morning.

7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia and will continue simvastatin to manage this condition.

8. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole.

9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and surgery. Prophylaxis measures such as pneumatic boots and possibly heparin will be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer who presented for a prostatectomy. He experienced significant blood loss during the surgery, resulting in difficult intubation and was sent to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an infection, which is likely secondary to pneumonia. Cultures have been taken but are still pending. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin. His blood glucose levels are poorly controlled, indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The patient's hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are currently being held due to his septic state. He requires continued monitoring of his blood and sputum cultures, as well as close attention to his hemodynamic status and fluid balance. The patient's difficult airway poses a challenge for extubation at this time. The patient's surgical history includes a suprapubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer, resulting in significant blood loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, and hypertension. He was admitted for a prostatectomy but developed complications post-surgery. He presented with fever and hypotension, indicating possible sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Blood cultures, sputum culture, and ABG were sent. The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to a difficult airway and has multiple lines including a central line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. He received blood transfusions in the OR and after arriving in the ICU. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, high blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient is also at risk for post-prostatectomy bleeding and requires close monitoring of hemoglobin levels. His blood pressure is currently stable with the use of vasopressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and risk factors, there is a potential for developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest sepsis, which could progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of prostatectomy and the use of anticoagulant medications increase the risk of bleeding, particularly post-prostatectomy bleed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poorly controlled diabetes, which may"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer, and hypertension who presented for prostatectomy. He experienced difficulty intubation and was sent to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Drop in hematocrit: There has been a significant drop in the patient's hematocrit levels over the past 24 hours. This could be due to hemolysis or internal hemorrhage. Given the recent surgery, there is a risk of intra-abdominal bleeding. A STAT CT abdomen without contrast and hemolysis labs have been ordered to further investigate this issue.
2. Sepsis: The patient likely has sepsis secondary to pneumonia. His elevated white blood cell count, fever spike, and hypotension (MAP < 60) suggest this diagnosis. It is important to continue monitoring blood and sputum cultures, maintaining a high MAP (>65), and providing appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Difficult airway: The patient has had difficulty with airway management, as evidenced by thick secretions and a recent RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) value. It may be necessary to reassess the possibility of extubation later in the afternoon.
4. Suprapubic prostatectomy: The patient underwent a suprapubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer,"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer who presented for a prostatectomy. He was found to have significant blood loss during the procedure, resulting in difficult intubation, and was sent to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, likely secondary to mechanical ventilation (ventilator-acquired pneumonia or VAP), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection, and he has been experiencing fevers and tachycardia. Sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, but cultures have been negative to date. The patient required vasopressor support overnight for blood pressure management but is currently stable.

The plan includes continuing to monitor blood and sputum cultures, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 with fluid boluses as needed, and focusing antibiotic therapy once cultures return. The patient will also be monitored for any changes in white blood cell count and fever curve.

Additionally, the patient has a difficult airway due to the recent surgery, so extubation is being held off. The patient underwent a suprapubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer with multiple bouts of urinary retention, resulting in an estimated blood loss of 1500cc. He received 6 liters of intravenous fluids and 2 units of packed red blood cells in the operating room, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has undergone a prostatectomy. They have been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which was initially intubation-related and subsequently developed into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever yesterday afternoon, along with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) and hypotension, suggests the possibility of a bleed. The patient's condition remains stable overall, but there are concerns regarding a potential retroperitoneal bleed given the post-operative status from the prostatectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator acquired (VAP): The patient continues to oxygenate well, but further monitoring and treatment are required. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, and if cultures remain negative, the antibiotic regimen may be tailored tomorrow.
2. Heme: The patient's HCT dropped acutely, indicating a possible bleed. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension responsive to fluids. Guaiac negative, and no clear source of bleeding has been identified. Given the recent prostatectomy, there is concern for a retroperitoneal bleed. The patient will receive a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and have their hemoglobin levels monitored every 6 hours today. Hemolysis labs will also be checked, and an abdominal CT scan will be performed to rule out surgical or retroperitoneal bleeding.
3. Respiratory Failure: Initially due to difficult intubation, the patient developed VAP. Currently, oxygenation is stable, and ventilation is appropriate. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted this afternoon, and extubation may take place today after checking for a cuff leak. Anesthesia support will be needed if extubation is planned, considering the initial difficult airway issues.
4. Post-op Prostectomy: The patient remains stable and is being evaluated for bleeding, as mentioned above. The urology recommendations will be followed, and input appreciated.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: The patient is awaiting the return of bowel function and evaluation of bleed, which has put their nutrition on hold per urology.
Glycemic Control: The patient is on an insulin sliding scale.
Lines: The patient has multiple lines inserted for various purposes.
Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP.
Code status: The patient has a full code status.
Disposition: The patient remains intubated to evaluate their condition.
Total time spent: The patient is critically ill."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill post-operative patient from a prostatectomy who is currently in the ICU. They have been febrile, developed hypotension, and experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) without a clear source of bleeding. They are being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics and are also being evaluated for a potential retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) due to the surgery. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, and they are planned for an abdominal CT to assess for any surgical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already being treated with antibiotics for this condition, but there is a risk of worsening or antibiotic resistance.
2. Retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed): Given the recent prostatectomy, the patient is at risk for bleeding in the retroperitoneal space, which could be life-threatening if not identified and managed promptly.
3. Difficult airway: The patient initially had a difficult intubation, which may complicate extubation and necessitate the presence of an anesthesiologist if extubation is planned.
4. Hypotension: The patient's episode of hypotension responsive to fluid administration indicates a potential risk for further episodes of low blood pressure, especially if the patient is bleeding or has ongoing fluid shifts.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient remains"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP): Continues to
   oxygenate well and RISB of 23.  Febrile yesterday and slight rise in
   WBC, all cultures negative.  Covered broadly with
   vancomycin/cipro/ceftaz D#3.  Hemodynamically stable and overall
   improving.
   - Continue current vancomycin/cipro/ceftaz for another 24h; if cultures
   negative will consider tailoring tomorrow.
   2) Heme: HCT dropped acutely, also episode of hypotension yesterday
   responsive to fluids. Guaiac negative, no clear source of bleeding.
   Concern for RP bleed given post-op from prostatectomy.
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBC, follow HCT q6h today
   - Check hemolysis labs
   - Obtain non-contrast abd CT to evaluate for surgical bleed/RP bleed
   3) Respiratory Failure:  Initially remained intubation related to
   difficult intubation and subsequently developed VAP. Curently
   oxygenation is stable and ventilation is appropriate.  RSBI 24.
   - Remain intubated this morning for abd CT.  Pending results, will
   consider SBT and extubation today after checking cuff leak this
   afternoon.
   - Will need anesthesia present if extubation planned given difficult
   airway issues initially.
   4) Post-op prostectomy:  Stable and evaluating bleed as above.
   - follow-up urology recs and appreciate input today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient developed fever yesterday afternoon and repeat cultures were sent.
- The patient also experienced an episode of hypotension, which responded to a decreased propofol dose and a bolus of 1L NS (normal saline).
- This morning, the patient woke up and indicated some abdominal pain.
- The patient's hematocrit (HCT) decreased from 32 to 21, but they are currently hemodynamically stable.
- An abdominal CT is planned to evaluate for a possible retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed), as the patient recently underwent a prostatectomy.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 09/29 at 08:00 PM (Vancomycin), 09:51 PM (Ciprofloxacin), and 12:00 AM on 09/30 (Ceftazidime).
- The patient is currently receiving propofol at a rate of 15 mcg/kg/min.
- Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given on 09/29 at 08:15 PM.
- There have been no changes to the patient's medical or family history.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new symptom of abdominal pain.
- Flowsheet data as of 08:23 AM on 09/30 shows the following vital signs: temperature (Tmax) of 38.7°C (101.6°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 99 bpm with a range of 94-112 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 107/53 to 137/69 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 12 breaths per minute with a range of 12-16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.
- The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR).
- Other flow sheet data includes fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and laboratory values.
- Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient being intubated and sedated.
- The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (HCT), and elevated platelet count (Plt).
- The assessment and plan include continued treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for acute drop in HCT, evaluation for a possible RP bleed, and consideration of extubation after an abdominal CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP, which is a common complication in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed): The patient's recent prostatectomy increases the risk of RP bleed. The acute drop in HCT and episode of hypotension may be indicative of bleeding. A non-contrast abdominal CT will be performed to evaluate for this complication.
3. Difficult airway: The patient initially had a difficult intubation, which can increase the risk of complications such as aspiration and airway obstruction during extubation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's episode of hypotension may indicate sepsis or bleeding. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation or blood transfusion may be necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is elevated, which can be a response to inflammation or infection. However, it is important to monitor the platelet count closely in case it drops and the patient becomes at risk for bleeding complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and prostate cancer (prostate CA) admitted to the ICU with difficult intubation and estimated blood loss (EBL) of 1.5 units. He is currently experiencing sepsis secondary to pneumonia, anemia, hypertension (HTN), and hypercholesterolemia. The patient underwent a suprapubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer with multiple bouts of urinary retention. He received 6 liters of intravenous fluid (IVF) and 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) in the operating room, and another 1 unit of pRBC after arriving in the ICU. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 153/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. He is mechanically ventilated in pressure-controlled ventilation mode (PCV/SBT) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL and a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 16 cmH2O. The patient has bibasilar rales on lung examination and tenderness at the incision site and suprapubic area. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods, and his respiratory culture showed sparse growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient's condition remains stable, and he is expected to be discharged today. Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia-related sepsis, anemia exacerbation, hypertension management, and hypercholesterolemia monitoring."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and prostate cancer (CA) who was admitted to the ICU for difficult intubation and excessive blood loss during surgery. He is currently being treated for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a significant drop in hematocrit (hct), but hemolysis labs were negative. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 153/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been successfully extubated and is now on nasal cannula with positive pressure ventilation. His fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 1,582 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient received 2 units of PRBC to address the significant hct drop. It is important to continue monitoring his hct levels and transfuse as necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggest ongoing infection. The sputum gram stain shows the presence of gram-positive cocci (GPC) and gram-negative rods (GNR), indicating a potential bacterial infection. Monitoring vital signs and blood cultures is essential to guide antibiotic therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with difficult intubation and estimated blood loss of 1.5 units. The patient is currently being treated for sepsis secondary to pneumonia, anemia, and other conditions.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a significant drop in hematocrit, but hemolysis labs were negative and the CT abdomen was negative for bleeding. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a maximum temperature of 100.7 degrees Celsius overnight. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has been off pressor support for more than 24 hours.

The patient's sputum gram stain showed the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and gram-negative rods with sparse growth. Blood and sputum cultures are still pending. The patient is currently on vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient had a difficult airway during intubation but has shown good respiratory function this morning. However, there are still thick secretions present, and the decision to extubate the patient will be reassessed later in the afternoon.

The patient underwent a suprapubic prostatectomy for prostate cancer with estimated blood loss of 1500cc. He received 6 liters of intravenous fluids and 2 units of PRBC in the operating"
