   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic anemia, CVA (stroke), and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated since December 11th and had a tracheostomy performed on December 24th. They were unable to change to a trach mask this morning due to low respiratory rates.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 161/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and their ABG results indicate a pH of 27, indicating respiratory acidosis.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,194 mL, with 617 mL via PO, 182 mL via TF, 890 mL via IVF, and 94 mL via other sources. Total output includes 1,780 mL via total out, 500 mL via urine, and 200 mL via NG. The respiratory support mode is CMV/ASSIST with set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Creatinine is 2.3 today, continuing to rise even with a positive fluid
   balance, in the face of mild diuresis. BUN/Cr ratio and urine lytes
   were not entirely consistent with pre-renal picture. Will benefit from
   further analysis as renal picture really is not clear at this point; we
   will call renal consult today. Appreciate nutrition recommendations on
   tube feeds, will continue to discuss with them ways of reducing overall
   fluid input while maintaining good nutrition.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Continues to require PS ventilation with trach mask. Taken off of
   antibiotics yesterday, will monitor over the next 1-2 days to assess
   for re-emerging infection. However in the absence of infection we are
   left with fluid overload and neurologic deficit (leading to poor cough,
   swallow and clearance) as primary explanations for continuing problems
   with secretion.
   - continue PS ventilation
   - again, will attempt to run negative today
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   glucose control was...
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Hematocrit low but not suggestive of bleeding. I am adding on anemia
   labs to r/o iron deficiency, most likely is anemia of chronic
   inflammation
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC / MENTAL STATUS
   Taking pt off sedation this morning. Still not especially interactive.
   Should reassess later in the day in order to see if communication is
   improving.
 GOALS OF CARE
   Now that patient is on trach this is time to revisit goals of care with
   family and if possible patient.
 DISPOSITION
   Patient's condition is unchanging at this point; likely can be
   transferred to vent rehab if renal issues/fluid balance can be managed
   there.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU with respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilation and an open tracheostomy.
- The patient had a tracheostomy procedure at the bedside yesterday and was unable to change to a trach mask this morning due to low respiratory rate.
- A PICC line was placed at the bedside and infused with 500ml of fluid overnight, with additional lasix held pending creatinine levels.
- The patient is on tube feeds and has a Foley catheter in place.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for somnolence appearing with sedation off for more than 2 hours.
- Physical examination shows poor dentition, moist mucus membranes, clear breath sounds with no wheezes, limited anterior exam due to restraints, and blister at right chest that has popped.
- Neurologic examination reveals no follow of simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, tries to move left arm against restraints, some movement of head/eyes, and tone not assessed.
- Labs show elevated creatinine levels indicating renal failure, as well as anemia and diabetes mellitus.
- Imaging shows poor definition of hemidiaphragms consistent with pleural fluid, atelectasis, and infiltrate at the bases.
- Assessment and plan include renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, and mental status changes due to cerebrovascular accident (stroke).

   Microbiology: No new micro data.
   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Creatinine is 2.3 today, continuing to rise even with a positive fluid
   balance, in the face of mild diuresis. [**Month (only) 60**] want to consider renal
   consult today to think about how to manage fluid balance. Nutrition
   consult pending to attempt to concentrate feeds and reduce fluid
   volume.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Continues to require PS ventilation with trach mask. Taken off of
   antibiotics yesterday, will monitor over the next 1-2 days to assess
   for re-emerging infection. However in the absence of infection we are
   left with fluid overload and neurologic deficit (leading to poor cough,
   swallow and clearance) as primary explanations for continuing problems
   with secretion.
   - continue PS ventilation
   - again, will attempt to run negative today
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   glucose control was...
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Hematocrit low but not suggestive of bleeding. Should do retic count
   today to assess production vs loss, would still transfuse at Hct <21,
   not there yet.
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC / MENTAL STATUS
   Taking pt off sedation this morning. Still not especially interactive.
   Should reassess later in the day in order to see if communication is
   improving.
 GOALS OF CARE
   Now that patient is on trach this is time to revisit goals of care with
   family and if possible patient.
 DISPOSITION
   Patient's condition is unchanging at this point; likely can be
   transferred to vent rehab if renal issues/fluid balance can be managed
   there.

   Need for restraints reviewed
   Comments: [**Month (only) 60**] benefit from limited physical therapy of left upper
   extremity which he moves against his restraint whenever awake.
   Communication:  Comments: Would do well to have meeting with family in
   next 1-2 days to discuss next steps and overall goals of care.
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has respiratory failure, chronic in nature, requiring positive pressure ventilation with a tracheostomy mask. The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by a rising creatinine level despite positive fluid balance. There are plans for a renal consult to manage fluid balance and consider nutrition consult to concentrate feeds and reduce fluid volume.

The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, cerebrovascular accident (stroke or ischemic cerebral infarction), and altered mental status. The patient's condition is described as unchanging, and it is mentioned that they may be transferred to vent rehab if renal issues and fluid balance can be managed there.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient's lungs do not clear secretions effectively, progression of renal failure if fluid overload continues, and potential infections due to the presence of a tracheostomy and ventilator use.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical details may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Creatinine is 2.3 today, continuing to rise even with a positive fluid
   balance, in the face of mild diuresis. BUN/Cr ratio and urine lytes
   were not entirely consistent with pre-renal picture. Will benefit from
   further analysis as renal picture really is not clear at this point; we
   will call renal consult today. Appreciate nutrition recommendations on
   tube feeds, will continue to discuss with them ways of reducing overall
   fluid input while maintaining good nutrition.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Continues to require PS ventilation with trach mask. Taken off of
   antibiotics yesterday, will monitor over the next 1-2 days to assess
   for re-emerging infection. However in the absence of infection we are
   left with fluid overload and neurologic deficit (leading to poor cough,
   swallow and clearance) as primary explanations for continuing problems
   with secretion.
   - continue PS ventilation
   - again, will attempt to run negative today
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Glucose control was not ideal
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Hematocrit low but not suggestive of bleeding. I am adding on anemia
   labs to r/o iron deficiency, most likely is anemia of chronic
   inflammation
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC / MENTAL STATUS
   Taking pt off sedation this morning. Still not especially interactive.
   Should reassess later in the day in order to see if communication is
   improving.
 GOALS OF CARE
   Now that patient is on trach this is time to revisit goals of care with
   family and if possible patient.
 DISPOSITION
   Patient's condition is unchanging at this point; likely can be
   transferred to vent rehab if renal issues/fluid balance can be managed
   there.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated since December 11th and underwent an open tracheostomy on December 24th. The patient also has a PICC line placed for medication administration. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/68-161/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,194 mL and output of 1,780 mL, resulting in a balance of 414 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 70, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, suggesting renal failure. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The patient also has chronic anemia with a hematocrit level of 21.9%. The patient's imaging shows a new PICC line in the expected location of the mid superior vena cava (SVC) and unchanged poor definition of the hemidiaphragms consistent with some combination"

 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Glucose control was not ideal today. Likely will need increase in
   long-acting insulin. Raises concern for possible brewing infection in
   setting of removing antibiotics; watch closely.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Hematocrit low but not suggestive of bleeding. I am adding on anemia
   labs to r/o iron deficiency, most likely is anemia of chronic
   inflammation.
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC / MENTAL STATUS
   Taking pt off sedation this morning. Still not especially interactive.
   Should reassess later in the day in order to see if communication is
   improving. Most likely a combination of diminished baseline with
   sedation, so removing sedation should assist in evaluating. Clearing
   even comparing morning pre-rounding exam (described above) to somewhat
   more interactive presentation during team rounds ~2 hours later, about
   2 and 4 hours after sedation stopped respectively.
 DISPOSITION
   Patient's condition is unchanging at this point; likely can be
   transferred to vent rehab if renal issues/fluid balance can be managed

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Creatinine is 2.3 today, continuing to rise even with a positive fluid
   balance, in the face of mild diuresis. BUN/Cr ratio and urine lytes
   were not entirely consistent with pre-renal picture. Will benefit from
   further analysis as renal picture really is not clear at this point; we
   will call renal consult today. Appreciate nutrition recommendations on
   tube feeds, will continue to discuss with them ways of reducing overall
   fluid input while maintaining good nutrition.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Continues to require PS ventilation with trach mask. Taken off of
   antibiotics yesterday, will monitor over the next 1-2 days to assess
   for re-emerging infection. However in the absence of infection we are
   left with fluid overload and neurologic deficit (leading to poor cough,
   swallow and clearance) as primary explanations for continuing problems
   with secretion.
   - continue PS ventilation, trials of trach mask
   - again, will attempt to run negative today, goal -500cc
   - watch closely for signs of possible re-emerging lung infection in
   context of antibiotics being removed
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Glucose control was not ideal today. Likely will need increase in
   long-acting insulin. Raises concern for possible brewing infection in
   setting of removing antibiotics; watch closely.
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   Hematocrit low but not suggestive of bleeding. I am adding on anemia
   labs to r/o iron deficiency, most likely is anemia of chronic
   inflammation.
 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC / MENTAL STATUS
   Taking pt off sedation this morning. Still not especially interactive.
   Should reassess later in the day in order to see if communication is
   improving. Most likely a combination of diminished baseline with
   sedation, so removing sedation should assist in evaluating. Clearing
   even comparing morning pre-rounding exam (described above) to somewhat
   more interactive presentation during team rounds ~2 hours later, about
   2 and 4 hours after sedation stopped respectively.
 DISPOSITION
   Patient's condition is unchanging at this point; likely can be
   transferred to vent rehab if renal issues/fluid balance can be managed
   there.
 NUTRITION
   Reducing free water boluses. Consulting nutrition as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated since December 11th and underwent an open tracheostomy on December 24th. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been weaned off sedation overnight. A PICC line was placed on December 24th, and the patient received Lasix to manage fluid balance. The patient's allergies include Levofloxacin. The patient is receiving various medications including Furosemide, Midazolam, Fentanyl, and others. The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of chronic inflammation, and a history of stroke. The patient's current vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 155/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's neurological status is somnolent and only mildly responsive, with limited movement and tone. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. The patient's imaging shows a new PICC line in the expected location and unchanged findings from previous chest X-rays. The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia, and a history of stroke"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient continues to require PS ventilation with a tracheostomy mask and has not fully recovered despite being taken off antibiotics.

2. Renal failure, acute: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated at 2.3, indicating impaired kidney function. The rise in creatinine despite a positive fluid balance suggests ongoing renal dysfunction.

3. Anemia, chronic: The patient's hematocrit is low, suggesting anemia. Further laboratory analysis is needed to rule out iron deficiency or anemia of chronic inflammation.

4. Diabetes mellitus, type II: The patient has uncontrolled glucose levels, indicating poorly managed diabetes.

5. CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), ischemic/mental status: The patient has a history of stroke and exhibits poor mental status and interaction.

6. Potential complications related to tracheostomy: Although the tracheostomy procedure was successful without complications, there is a risk of infection or bleeding.

7. Potential complications related to invasive ventilation: Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, and barotrauma.

8. Potential complications related to poor nutritional status: The patient's limited ability to eat and potential malnutrition increases the risk of further complications such as pressure ulcers, weakened immune system, and impaired wound healing.

   PLEURAL EFFUSION
   Attempted trach mask trial on rounds. Patient with respiratory rate in
   mid-30's but doesn't seem particularly distressed. Will try
   ""sprint-rest"" weaning protocol with 20 minute trials on four occasions
   today separated by several hours of rest. If respiratory rate stays
   within the 30's with this, we will try to progress with slightly longer
   periods on trach mask each day.
   Antibiotic course completed. Afebrile. WBC normal.
   Creat climbing despite volume resuscitation. Urine Na was up when
   checked before lasix started; argues against pre-renal state. No
   obvious cause of interstitial nephritis. Will consult renal service.
   Hct 21.9 - nearing transfusion threshold. No obvious bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure and has a history of chronic respiratory disease. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/48 mmHg to 155/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 174 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 240 K/uL.

The patient has been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure (acute on chronic renal failure), type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, and a history of ischemic stroke. The patient has received a blood transfusion for anemia.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. The use of a tracheostomy increases the risk of ventilator-associated complications. The patient's elevated temperature suggests the presence of an infection. The patient's acute renal failure may be related to hypotension and sepsis. Additionally"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a sedated and unresponsive individual with respiratory failure. They have been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure, acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, and a history of ischemic stroke. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a high of 101.1°F measured orally and around baseline of 98°F axillary. They have shown signs of agitation, increased respiratory rate, and mucoid guaiac positive foul-smelling stool, indicating possible Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's blood cultures have been taken multiple times, and they have received a blood transfusion. They have also undergone trials of tracheostomy mask for respiratory muscle strengthening. The patient's vital signs are as follows: heart rate (HR) of 90 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 107/48 mmHg to 155/104 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 19-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1950 mL and total output of 1930 mL, with urine output of 1930 mL. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   See discharge summary for more complete discussion of his entire course
   and status at discharge.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   s/p trach. At this point respiratory failure likely mostly due to fluid
   overload; pneumonia treated with extremely broad coverage x14 days.
   Doing trach mask trials to build tolerance/strength for possible future
   extubation. Need to diurese with very high doses in order to make
   progress in context of his fluid overload.
   --C. DIFF INFECTION
   While on rounds, C diff came back positive. Starting flagyl. Most
   likely secondary to extensive antibiotic exposure, when stopped little
   normal flora remaining, provides opportunity for C diff. Likely caught
   very early in infection course, can treat with flagyl for 14 days.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Acute on chronic renal failure. Likely secondary to ATN per renal. OK
   to diurese further, will likely require this to get fluid off lungs.
   - diurese today with goal -500 cc, lasix as needed to get to this goal,
   HCTZ if needed
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II

 ANEMIA, CHRONIC
   received 1 unit PRBC [**2154-12-25**] for hct 21.8. Will establish aranesp dose

 CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC
   Difficult to assess what is baseline mental status at this point. See

The patient has mucoid, guiac positive, foul-smelling stool, indicating Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. They are also agitated and have an increased respiratory rate. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and is receiving aggressive diuresis with Lasix. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 90-116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/48-155/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30-38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive, making it difficult to assess their mental status. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and blood glucose levels. The patient's hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to fluid overload, and pneumonia has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 14 days. Tracheostomy mask trials are being conducted to build tolerance and strength for possible future extubation.

2. C. diff Infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff infection. Treatment with flagyl for 14 days has been initiated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and anemia. He has a history of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, ischemic stroke, and previous C. difficile infection. The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday and developed a fever. He was treated with ativan for agitation and diuresed with lasix to achieve a small negative fluid balance. Cultures were sent for blood and urine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 86-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/47-144/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on trach mask with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate an infection, possibly leading to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest possible AKI on top of his pre-existing chronic renal failure.
3. Pneumonia: Despite completing the course of antibiotics, the presence of pneumonia cannot be ruled out, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illnesses.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient tested positive for C. difficile in the stool and was started on Flagyl.
5. Diabetes complications: The patient's diabetes may lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Stroke: The patient's ischemic stroke could potentially worsen or result in new neurological deficits.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further management and monitoring.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration, especially considering the potential complications mentioned above."
