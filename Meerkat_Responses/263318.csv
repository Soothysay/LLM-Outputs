   Assessment and Plan
   18 F, college student, no past medical history, admit to MICU with
   septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve
   deficits.
   # Septic shock.  During early MICU course, patient developing
   progressive hypotensive, not completely responsive to fluid boluses;
   hypotension persisting despite normal CVP (>10).  Starting levophed.
   Abnormal neck and cranial nerve exams as above.  Source of infection:
   neck/adenopathy ?Lemierre
s; septic cavernous venous thrombosis,
   meningitis/other CNS infection; pulmonary source (abnormal CXR and
   exam), GI source -> GNR bacteremia; GYN source (less likely as patient
   not sexually active), urinary organisms.   Clinically, Lemierres with
   cavernous venous thrombosis seems to be most consistent with clinical
   picture, though prelim read of MRI negative for this.
   -          CVL in place, goal CVP 8-12.  Bolus prn to achieve this.
   -          Aline in place, MAP goal 60-65.    Levophed if needed.
   -          Broad spectrum antibiotics
 cefepime (at CNS doses), vanco,
   flagyl. Coverage of GNRs, fusobacterium, staph/strep, meningitis bugs.
   Appreciate ID input.
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH and here.
   -          Urine cultures, stool cultures if diarrhea.
   -          MRI of neck as below.
   -          Consider panCt with contrast if answer not found from
   MRI/MRA/MRV.
   -          Consider LP.
   -          Consider activated protein C, though ?DIC/thrombocytopenia
   as a contraindication.  Calculate APACHE.
   -          Glucose control
   -          Discuss steroids if pressor requirement increases and doing
   poorly; otherwise no indication currently.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxia.  During early MICU course, patient with
   worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement.  Lung exam also
   evolving with worsening breath sounds on L>R side.  Tachypneic to the
   40s -> ?need to intubate.
   -          Continue to monitor; low threshold for intubation.
   -          [**Month (only) 51**] need ARDSnet on vent
   -          Sputum culture +/- bronchoscopy
   -          Consider rule out PE, especially if considering septic
   thrombosis.
   # Cranial nerve abnormalities.  Appears to have deficits of III, ?IV,
   V, ?X (vs. longerstanding uvular deviation).  NCHCT at OSH reportedly
   normal.  Findings along with septic picture concerning for cavernous
   venous thrombosis, however, prelim read of MRI not suggestive of this.
   -          f/u MRI/MRA/MRV final read.
   -          Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recs.
   -          If +cavernous venous thrombosis , ?benefits of
   anticoagulation.
   -          Likely LP tonight.
   # ARF.  Volume depletion vs. prerenal from hypotension, vs. ischemic
   ATN/septic ATN.  Slowly improving with IVFs.
   -          continue to bolus for cvp <[**11-29**].
   -          Urine lytes
   -          Careful I/O, foley in place.
   -          ?need for gent or CT contrast; will discuss.
   # DIC.  Elevated coags, dropping platelets, anemia with schistocytes.
   -          continue to monitor, including fibrinogen
   -          consider blood products peri-procedure prn.
   -          Need to review IHOS peripheral smear.
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Elevated lactate here, also with ARF.
   -          monitor ABG/VBG
   -          Ensure adequate MAPs/perfusion.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient is admitted with septic shock and GNR bacteremia. This indicates an ongoing infection that requires prompt management to prevent further complications.

2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension not completely responsive to fluid boluses suggests septic shock. Appropriate interventions such as vasopressors (levophed) and fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

3. Cavernous venous thrombosis: The patient exhibits cranial nerve deficits and cervical swelling, which could be indicative of cavernous venous thrombosis. Further evaluation with imaging studies (MRI/MRA/MRV) is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

4. Respiratory distress/hypoxia: The patient's worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement, and abnormal lung exam findings suggest respiratory distress. Close monitoring and possible intubation may be required to prevent further deterioration.

5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to volume depletion, hypotension, or septic ATN. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary, along with appropriate fluid management.

6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results show elevated coagulation parameters and a dropping platelet count, which are consistent with DIC. Close monitoring"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing sepsis, as indicated by the chief complaint. They have undergone several diagnostic procedures and treatments. The note provides details on the patient's medical history, allergies, last doses of antibiotics, vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr), decreased total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in liver enzymes (ALT/AST), kidney function (BUN/creatinine), and coagulation parameters (PT/PTT/INR). There are also elevated levels of D-dimer, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient is diagnosed with shock, meningitis, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include worsening sepsis leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), development of antibiotic resistance, further deterioration of renal function leading to chronic kidney disease, progression of respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation, and potential neurological complications due"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 F, college student, no past medical history, admit to MICU with
   septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve
   deficits.
   # Septic shock.  During early MICU course, patient developing
   progressive hypotensive, not completely responsive to fluid boluses;
   hypotension persisting despite normal CVP (>10).  Starting levophed.
   Abnormal neck and cranial nerve exams as above.  Source of infection:
   neck/adenopathy ?Lemierre
s; septic cavernous venous thrombosis,
   meningitis/other CNS infection; pulmonary source (abnormal CXR and
   exam), GI source -> GNR bacteremia; GYN source (less likely as patient
   not sexually active), urinary organisms.   Clinically, Lemierres with
   cavernous venous thrombosis seems to be most consistent with clinical
   picture, though prelim read of MRI negative for this.
   -          CVL in place, goal CVP 8-12.  Bolus prn to achieve this.
   -          Aline in place, MAP goal 60-65.    Levophed if needed.

   -          Urine cultures, stool cultures if diarrhea.
   -          MRI of neck as below.
   -          Consider panCt with contrast if answer not found from
   MRI/MRA/MRV.
   -          Consider LP.
   -          Consider activated protein C, though ?DIC/thrombocytopenia
   as a contraindication.  Calculate APACHE.
   -          Glucose control
   -          Discuss steroids if pressor requirement increases and doing
   poorly; otherwise no indication currently.
   # Respiratory distress/hypoxia.  During early MICU course, patient with
   worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement.  Lung exam also
   evolving with worsening breath sounds on L>R side.  Tachypneic to the
   40s -> ?need to intubate.
   -          Continue to monitor; low threshold for intubation.
   -          [**Month (only) 51**] need ARDSnet on vent
   -          Sputum culture +/- bronchoscopy
   -          Consider rule out PE, especially if considering septic
   thrombosis.
   # Cranial nerve abnormalities.  Appears to have deficits of III, ?IV,
   V, ?X (vs. longerstanding uvular deviation).  NCHCT at OSH reportedly
   normal.  Findings along with septic picture concerning for cavernous
   venous thrombosis, however, prelim read of MRI not suggestive of this.
   -          f/u MRI/MRA/MRV final read.

   -          If +cavernous venous thrombosis , ?benefits of
   anticoagulation.
   -          Likely LP tonight.
   # ARF.  Volume depletion vs. prerenal from hypotension, vs. ischemic
   ATN/septic ATN.  Slowly improving with IVFs.
   -          continue to bolus for cvp <[**11-29**].
   -          Urine lytes
   -          Careful I/O, foley in place.
   -          ?need for gent or CT contrast; will discuss.
   # DIC.  Elevated coags, dropping platelets, anemia with schistocytes.
   -          continue to monitor, including fibrinogen
   -          consider blood products peri-procedure prn.
   -          Need to review IHOS peripheral smear.
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Elevated lactate here, also with ARF.
   -          monitor ABG/VBG

","Summary:
The patient is a 18-year-old college student with no past medical history who was admitted to the MICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve deficits. The patient has been experiencing progressive hypotension that is not completely responsive to fluid boluses, despite normal central venous pressure (CVP). The patient's neck and cranial nerve exams are abnormal, indicating a potential source of infection in the neck/adenopathy (Lemierre syndrome), septic cavernous venous thrombosis, meningitis/other CNS infection, pulmonary source (abnormal chest X-ray and exam), or gastrointestinal source (GNR bacteremia).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and low CVP suggest ongoing septic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive management with fluids and vasopressors are required to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
2. Cavernous venous thrombosis: The patient's cranial nerve abnormalities and cervical swelling may indicate a cavernous venous thrombosis. Further evaluation with imaging studies, such as MRI/MRA/MRV, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, anticoagulation therapy may be considered.
3. Meningitis/other CNS infection: The presence of cranial nerve deficits raises concern for meningitis or other central nervous system infections. Lumbar puncture may be performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid and guide"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 18-year-old college student with no past medical history. They were admitted to the MICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve deficits. The patient has been diagnosed with several potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient requires norepinephrine for blood pressure support. They also have abnormal neck and cranial nerve exams, indicating meningitis and GNR bacteremia. The clinical picture suggests Lemierre's syndrome with cavernous venous thrombosis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed worsening tachypnea, increasing O2 requirement, and required intubation. They are currently on ARDSnet ventilation with a goal of keeping PaO2 >55 and pH >7.2.

3. Cranial nerve abnormalities/venous thrombosis/meningitis: The patient appears to have deficits of II, III, and possibly IV, V cranial nerves. These findings, along with septic shock, are concerning for cavernous venous thrombosis. MRI initially read as normal but now shows significant abnormalities upon multiple re-reads. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure (OP) of 52 and a picture consistent with bacterial meningitis.

4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient may have volume depletion, prerenal hypotension, ischemic ATN/septic ATN. There is a possibility of throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) ,concern for
   enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus with an OP of
   52 on LP and 900 WBC in the CSF
   Septic Shock/Meningitis: Concern for GNR in the blood (anaerobic
   bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Given the
   imaging findings there is significant concern for a evolving cavernous
   sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the
   temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for
   a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to
   cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime and
   Vancomycin.She received a dose of dexamethasone after the LP.  We also
   have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV given the quesiton of enhancement
   of the dura of the temporal lobe. We  will dicuss further with ID and
   neurosurgery the need for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis.
   Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess
   and no cord evolvement.

   - ARDS ventilation: Goal PaO2 > 55mmHg, ph>7.20
   - CT scan of the chest today (PE protocol)
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We will consult with Heme today, given
   that we may need to anti-coagulate for a potential sinus thrombosis.
   The management of the DIC is likely to be supportive. Concern also
   exists potentially for TTP

   abnormalities at the level of the R-Cavernous sinus compatible with
   infection and possible sinus cavernous thrombosis. After discussing
   benefits and risks of anticoagulation with the family we decided to
   proceed with anticoagulation with IV heparin (no bolus/ goal PTT 50)
   F/u PT/INR and PLts closely.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who presented with right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle). There are concerns for septic shock/meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Imaging findings indicate significant concern for evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and her condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's presentation suggests septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.
2. Meningitis: The presence of high OP on CSF and 900 WBC raises concerns for meningitis, an infection of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
3. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: The imaging findings indicate a potential thrombosis in the cavernous sinus, a serious condition that can lead to complications such as vision loss or stroke.
4. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory decline and evolving CXR pattern are concerning for ARDS, a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of severe infections or injuries.
5. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient's elevated INR, PTT, and decreased platelets indicate"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) ,concern for
   enhancement along the dura of the right cavernous sinus with an OP of
   52 on LP and 900 WBC in the CSF
   Septic Shock/Meningitis: Concern for GNR in the blood (anaerobic
   bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Given the
   imaging findings there is significant concern for a evolving cavernous
   sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the
   temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for
   a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to
   cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime and
   Vancomycin.She received a dose of dexamethasone after the LP.  We also
   have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV given the quesiton of enhancement
   of the dura of the temporal lobe. We  will dicuss further with ID and
   neurosurgery the need for potential anti-coagulation for thrombosis.
   Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess
   and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI
   - Q 8 hr lactate and can check mixed venous sat
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   - recalculate APACHE, will need to re-consider APC
   - Follow up with ID and neurosurgery re: anticoagulation and sinus
   thrombosis
   - TTE
   - She will need dexamethasone
   Increased intracranial pressure: will d/w with neurosurgery re:
   Hypoxemic respi failure: her CXRs have evolved a pattern concerning for
   ARDS over the last 12 hrs concomitant with her respi decline. She is
   currently intubated and sedated via ARDS guidelines. We will plan to
   image the lungs with CT scan today to further evaluate
   - ARDS ventilation: Goal PaO2 > 55mmHg, ph>7.20
   - CT scan of the chest today (PE protocol)
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We will consult with Heme today, given
   that we may need to anti-coagulate for a potential sinus thrombosis.
   The management of the DIC is likely to be supportive. Concern also
   exists potentially for TTP
   - Cont to folloq q 6hrs DIC labs
   - peripheral smear
   - Hematology consult
   - CT abd (given other potential etiology of thrombocytopenia would be
   splenic sequestration)
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal as she had a Cr of 2.5 at the OSH and is now 1.4. We will
   check urine lytes. Her UOP is below goal. We also need to be concerned
   for TTP given her overall presentation and the presence of schistos on

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill 18-year-old female with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia. She has an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (OP 52 cm) and 900 WBCs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There are also imaging findings indicating concern for evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock/meningitis: The patient has a high OP on CSF and 900 WBCs, suggesting meningitis. The presence of GNR bacteremia in the blood and the anaerobic bottle raises concern for septic shock.

2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The imaging findings indicate a potential thrombosis in the cavernous sinus, which could lead to serious complications if not addressed promptly.

3. Infection/inflammation: The patient has evidence of inflammation/infection along the right scalp extending into the right neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. This suggests the possibility of a head/neck infection that may have extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has declined, and there are concerns for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). She is currently intubated and sedated,"

   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.

   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,

   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of right-sided neck pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including a right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding abscess, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and suspected Lemierre's disease. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various antibiotics, antivirals, and anticoagulants. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: The MRI/MRV shows a right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding abscess, which indicates a potential complication of cavernous sinus thrombosis. This can lead to symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, and cranial nerve palsies.

2. Lemierre's Disease: The patient's clinical picture is consistent with Lemierre's disease, which is a rare complication of oropharyngeal infection leading to septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and subsequent embolic events. The patient may be at risk of developing septic emboli, leading to pulmonary, cerebral, or other systemic infections.

3. Infection: The patient has multiple signs of infection including elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods. There is also evidence of possible early abscess formation in the pterygoid muscles and lymphadenopathy. Infections can progress and cause further complications such as sepsis or organ"

   Imaging:
   CXR.  [**2105-12-28**].
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-27**], there has been
   placement of
   an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.
   CT Neck:
   1. Multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid, predominantly in
   pterygoid
   muscle, also in the parapharyngeal space, and longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle,
   which is
   indicative for early abscess formation with no discrete collection
   formed yet.
   Extensive right neck tissue swelling and lymphadenopathy as more fully
   characterized on MR from same day with associated superficial vein
   thrombosis.
   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,
   correlate
   with CTA from same day for full characterization.
   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out
   few cms.
   3) multiple areas of consolidation, more on left, probably representing
   infection, septic emboli, or less likely cocaine use or vasculitis.
   4) atelectasis of LLL, could be post aspiration.
   5) small amount of pelvic free fluid.
   6) mild stranding in paracolic regions.
   7) wedge shape hypodense area in right kidney.
   Echo: [**2105-11-28**].
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   MRA/MRV brain, neck:
   MRI BRAIN: Abnormal enhancement along the dura of the R cavernous
   sinus. There
   may be abnormal soft tissue within it. The enhancement continues along
   the
   undersurface of the R temporal lobe dura. Suspect
   inflammation/infection.
   There is fluid/inflammation along the R scalp extending inferiorly into
   the R
   neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. Possibility of R
   head/neck
   infection that extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus
   producing
   [**Last Name (un) 3457**]-Hunt must be considered. The cavernous sinus is not definitely
   thrombosed-yet- as neither it nor the R superior ophthalmic vein is
   enlarged,
   but this should be followed as a potential complication. Very early
   sinus
   thrombosis cannot absolutely be excluded. MRA BRAIN: Normal
   intracranial
   arteries MRA NECK: Normal carotids/vertebrals MRV HEAD: Normal MRV [**Name Initial (MD) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 18-year-old college student with no past medical history who was admitted to the MICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, cervical swelling, and cranial nerve deficits. The patient has been diagnosed with cavernous sinus thrombosis, sepsis, DIC, elevated intracranial pressure, respiratory failure, septic thromboembolism, renal failure, and Lemierre's disease. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is on mechanical ventilation. They are also receiving anticoagulation therapy and have a central venous line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's condition may worsen if there is no improvement in their septic state, leading to further organ dysfunction.
2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: There is a risk of worsening of the thrombosis and potential spread of infection to other areas of the body.
3. Elevated intracranial pressure: If not managed appropriately, the elevated intracranial pressure can lead to neurological complications such as brain herniation.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, necessitating increased ventilatory support or alternative respiratory management strategies.
5. Renal failure: If the renal function does not improve, the patient may require renal replacement therapy.
6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulation status needs close monitoring, and they"

   24 Hour Events:
   -MRI/MRV showed right cavernous venous thrombus with surrounding
   abscess
   - LP gram stain negative, cultures pending (990 WBCs, Opening pressure
   >50) - CSF crypto negative.
   - GNRs in [**3-23**] bottles from [**Location (un) 615**] blood cultures.   Speciation will be
   complete in the evening today.
   -Neurology recommended serial LPs to lower ICP. They did not recommend
   anticoagulation given the risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and
   inability to difinitively state that there was a cavernous sinus
   thrombus.  They did not recomend continuous ICP monitoring.  They also
   recommended sending off state encephalitus panel, CMV pcr, VZV prn, EMV
   pcr.
   -Neurosurgery did not recommend continuous ICP monitoring.
   -ID believes this is Lemierre's disase with cavernous veins
   thrombosis. felt ampicillin could be stopped due to presence of GNR
   bacteremia.  Acyclovir can be stopped when HSV PCR is negative.
   - Renal felt renal failure was pre-renal renal failure and requested
   UOsms be sent
   - ENT performed throat culture.  They are concerned about right upper
   wisdom tooth infection and recommended oral surgery consult
   - Heme feels clinical picture is consistent with DIC.  They agree with
   role of anticoagulation given cavernous venous thrombus.
   - Oral surgery suspects possible 3rd molar infection which drains to
   pterygoid plexus --> emissary veins --> cavernous sinus
   - sedation lighted to bolus sedation with good effect
   - Anticoagulated for approximately 8 hours.  Heparin stopped due to
   thrombocytopenia.

   Imaging:
   CXR.  [**2105-12-28**].
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-27**], there has been
   placement of
   an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
   Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the left IJ catheter
   remains in place.
   Interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
   Some of
   this probably represents overhydration or pulmonary vascular
   congestion.
   However, in view of the clinical history, the possibility of multifocal
   pneumonia or even ARDS must be considered.
   CT Neck:
   1. Multiple hypodense areas in the pterygoid, predominantly in
   pterygoid
   muscle, also in the parapharyngeal space, and longus [**Last Name (un) **] muscle,
   which is
   indicative for early abscess formation with no discrete collection
   formed yet.
   Extensive right neck tissue swelling and lymphadenopathy as more fully
   characterized on MR from same day with associated superficial vein
   thrombosis.
   2. Endotracheal tube at the carina recommended to pullback by several
   centimeters. Multiple pulmonary focal infiltrates at the apices,
   correlate
   with CTA from same day for full characterization.
   CT Torso:
   1) no central or segmental PE.
   2) tip of endotracheal tube at level of carina. Should be pulled out
   few cms.
   3) multiple areas of consolidation, more on left, probably representing
   infection, septic emboli, or less likely cocaine use or vasculitis.
   4) atelectasis of LLL, could be post aspiration.
   5) small amount of pelvic free fluid.
   6) mild stranding in paracolic regions.
   7) wedge shape hypodense area in right kidney.
   Echo: [**2105-11-28**].
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No significant valvular abnormalities. No vegetations found.
   MRA/MRV brain, neck:
   MRI BRAIN: Abnormal enhancement along the dura of the R cavernous
   sinus. There
   may be abnormal soft tissue within it. The enhancement continues along
   the
   undersurface of the R temporal lobe dura. Suspect
   inflammation/infection.
   There is fluid/inflammation along the R scalp extending inferiorly into
   the R
   neck and infratemporal fossa/masticator space. Possibility of R
   head/neck
   infection that extended venous-retrograde into the cavernous sinus
   producing
   [**Last Name (un) 3457**]-Hunt must be considered. The cavernous sinus is not definitely
   thrombosed-yet- as neither it nor the R superior ophthalmic vein is
   enlarged,
   but this should be followed as a potential complication. Very early
   sinus
   thrombosis cannot absolutely be excluded. MRA BRAIN: Normal

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil.  Now improved ability to raise right eyelid and ?mild
   reactivity to right eye.  Was briefly anticoagulated yesterday, but
   anticoagulation held with platelets fells to 48 and remained below 50.
   After discussion with heme, will resume anticoagulation after tooth
   extract and transfuse platelets if necessary.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Bolus sedation to improve ability to assess mental status
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   3.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          monitor urine output
   2.       Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   -          dental extraction
   -          transfuse platelets prior to dental extraction
   -          drainage of pterygoid muscle abscess
   3.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  Had
   echo yesterday but no bubble study.  Will get TEE with buble study in
   OR today.
   -          bubble study / TEE today
   4.       DIC.   Fibrinogen initially trending down, but now in 400s.
   Platelets stable at 50.  INR remains stable at around 1.6.  Fibrin
   split product mildly rising.  Given that patient has low grade DIC,
   concern for anticoagulation, but will pursue anticoagulation given
   improvement in morbitiy with this approach.
   -          serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   -          transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
   -          appreciate heme recs
   5.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   -          appreciate neuro recs
   6.       Respiratory failureure.  Patient is requiring less and less
   vent support.  Had RSBI this morning of 50.  Given need for several
   procedures (dental extraction, TEE), will keep her intubated for now,
   but may be extubated soon.
   -          pressure support
   -          bolus sedation so that mental status can be assessed
   7.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   -          fluid boluses for low urine output
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          really dose all medications

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr

   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle), and cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is now showing signs of improvement. The patient's current conditions include sinus cavernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis, meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900 WBC. Imaging findings reveal significant concern for an evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, indicating an anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Metronidazole, Ampicillin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin) and dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. Acyclovir has also been added to cover for HSV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's condition indicates a thrombosis in the cavernous sinus, which is a serious complication requiring prompt treatment.
2. Sepsis: The presence of GNR bacteremia and high white blood cell count in the CSF suggests sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention.
3. Meningitis: The elevated opening pressure (OP) on CSF and the presence of 900 WBC in the CSF"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]
   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal PTT 50K
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC and acute renal failure now
   improving
   Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningitis with high OP on CSF and 900
   WBC. Given the imaging findings there is significant concern for a
   evolving cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension
   to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain
   this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At
   present we have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole,
   Ampicillin, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for
   cavernous sinus thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for
   HSV and will continue until we have neg clx data. We  will dicuss
   further with ID and neurosurgery the need for potential
   anti-coagulation for thrombosis. Notably ENT had evaluated and saw no
   evidence of peri-tonsilar abscess and no cord evolvement.
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing)
   - NE for MAP goal of > 60 mmHg, 2nd pressor to add would be
   vasopressin.
   - Vigileo with flow track for continous monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]
   - Will plan to go OR for tooth extraction and pterygoid drainage
   - TEE with agitated saline given concern for renal infarct (right
   kidney) and the need for anti-coagulation.
   - F/u CSF studies
   Hypoxemic respi failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. changed to
   PS today, doing very well with minimal vent support.Will remain
   intubated
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   DIC/Anemia: evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and
   decreased plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP.
   The most likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis.
   For now our care is supportive. We have discussed with heme and the
   plan is to give supportive plts to keep plts>50 (for surgery) and also
   supportively post surgery when we will need to anti-coagulate
   - peripheral smear
   Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal PTT 50K
   Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with admission of right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute renal failure. The patient is currently improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with potential extension to the dura of the temporal lobe.
2. Anaerobic process, possibly caused by fusobacterium, indicated by neck pain and imaging findings.
3. GNR bacteremia and sepsis.
4. Meningitis with high OP on CSF.
5. Evolving DIC physiology with elevated INR, PTT (mild), and decreased platelets.
6. Acute renal failure.
7. Hypoxemic respiratory failure due to bilateral septic pulmonary emboli.
8. Potential need for anti-coagulation for thrombosis.
9. Possibility of renal infarct (right kidney), requiring anti-coagulation.
10. Supportive care for DIC and anemia, including transfusion of platelets.
11. Anticoagulation management with IV heparin, considering platelet count and INR levels.
12. Continued monitoring and management of renal failure, considering pre-renal causes.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and consultation with specialists may"

   Extensive right-sided facial swelling. Sinus disease within the

   paranasal sinuses including dense secretions within the right sphenoid
   sinus
   which may represent inspissated secretions versus an infectious process
   such
   as fungal infection. No bony erosive changes evident.
   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle.
   >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningeal inflammation. She currently has
   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.
   TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she had no
   PFO)
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Vigileo with flow track for contins monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system)
   - Will discuss new imaging head and sinus CT with neurosurgery and OMF
   [**Doctor First Name 213**]. .
   - F/u CSF studies: HSV (cont acyclovir)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. Has
   remained on PS and is doing very well with minimal vent support.. Will
   remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurg  (ie
   further procedures)
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. She has continued to increase her fibrinogen
   and her plts responded appropriately
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration and cont to monitor
   electrolyte function.
   - let her set I/O goal

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a history of right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient has undergone tooth removal and exploration of the pterygoid muscle.

The patient's current condition includes sinus cavernous thrombosis with GNR in the blood and sepsis, meningitis, and potential meningeal inflammation. The presence of neck pain is concerning for an anaerobic process, specifically fusobacterium. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin. Dexamethasone is being continued for cavernous sinus thrombosis, and acyclovir has been added to cover for HSV.

The patient is also being anticoagulated with a goal aPTT for 50-60 due to cavernous sinus thrombosis. The ID team agrees with anticoagulation, and a TEE was negative for ASD. However, it was not mentioned that the patient had no PFO.

Other assessments and plans include hypoxemic respiratory failure due to bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, which has responded well to PS ventilation and pulmonary toilet. The patient will remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurgery for further procedures.

DIC/Anemia is also present, with elevated INR, PTT"

   This was a directed study to r/o evidence of endocarditis, as well as
   to r/o ASD.
   No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in
   diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
   The tricuspid and pulmonic valves appear structurally normal, with no
   regurgitation or abnormal masses.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
   leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   No evidence of ASD. No evidence of endocarditis.
   Imaging: CT head: [**2105-12-29**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Predominantly right-sided sinus disease as described above.
   Increased
   density of the right sphenoid sinus material may represent inspissated
   secretions or less likely fungal sinusitis. Clinical correlation is
   recommended. No bony change of the sinuses is noted.
   2. Probable 8 mm right temporal lobe hypodense lesion which may
   represent
   partial volume averaging or early intracranial inflammatory or
   infective or
   ischemic focus. Assessment is somewhat limited due to lack of
   pre-contrast
   images. tMRI head without and with conrast is recommended for further
   assessment.
   3. Persistent hypodense areas within the right pterygoid muscle, not
   significantly changed compared to the CT from one day prior, phlegmon
   versus
   early abscess. This is inadequatey evaluated on the present study.
   4. Extensive right-sided facial and neck swelling, incompletely
   visualized on
   this CT of the head. Pl. see the CT Neck report done a day earlier.
   Findings reviewed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3523**] at 11:30 pm by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3524**].
   Findings and recommendation were also discussed with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor Last Name 3525**] by
   Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2105-12-30**]. Approval of the report was delayed due to the
   delay in
   obtaining the necessary bone algorithm images for the CT sinuses.
   CXR.  [**2105-12-29**].
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Stable appearance of support lines as described.
   2. Improved bilateral airspace consolidation, which may represent
   improved
   volume status; however, underlying ARDS and/or multifocal pneumonia
   cannot be
   excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil upon admission with stable neuro exam.  Getting
   anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.  Will
   transfuse platelets if < 50, though stable today after platelet
   transfusion yesterday prior to dental extraction.  Remains on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Minimize sedation to monitor neuro exam (will switch
   propofol)
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess overnight.  On official
   read, study is limited.
   - neurosurg consult re:? need for surgical drainage of ??? abscess or
   need for further imaging
   3.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain, and NGTD.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u HSV PCR, csf culture
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   4.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir\
   5.        Thrombocytopenia.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable.  Thrombocytopenia likely
   secondary to DIC.
   - follow platelets
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].  Only able to drain a few ccs
   from parapharyngeal and masticator space.
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery
   -          drain removal tomorrow
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  TEE
   showed no ASD, though did not evaluate with agitated saline for PFO.
   8.       DIC.   Fibrinogen falling today.  Platelets stable. INR
   trending down, now 1.5.  Fibrin split product mildly rising.  Given
   that patient has low grade DIC, concern for anticoagulation, but will
   pursue anticoagulation given improvement in morbitiy with this
   approach.
    - serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   - transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
            - appreciate heme recs
   9.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   9.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is requiring less and less vent
   support.  Will likely extubate today
   - continue with pressure support
   - propofol for sedation
   10.    Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  monitor creatinine
   - really dose all medications

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil.  Now improved ability to raise right eyelid and ?mild
   reactivity to right eye.  Was briefly anticoagulated yesterday, but
   anticoagulation held with platelets fells to 48 and remained below 50.
   After discussion with heme, will resume anticoagulation after tooth
   extract and transfuse platelets if necessary.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Bolus sedation to improve ability to assess mental status
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   3.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          monitor urine output
   Thrombocytopenia
   .
   2.       Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   -          dental extraction
   -          transfuse platelets prior to dental extraction
   -          drainage of pterygoid muscle abscess
   3.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  Had
   echo yesterday but no bubble study.  Will get TEE with buble study in
   OR today.
   -          bubble study / TEE today
   4.       DIC.   Fibrinogen initially trending down, but now in 400s.
   Platelets stable at 50.  INR remains stable at around 1.6.  Fibrin
   split product mildly rising.  Given that patient has low grade DIC,
   concern for anticoagulation, but will pursue anticoagulation given
   improvement in morbitiy with this approach.
   -          serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   -          transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
   -          appreciate heme recs
   5.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   -          appreciate neuro recs
   6.       Respiratory failureure.  Patient is requiring less and less
   vent support.  Had RSBI this morning of 50.  Given need for several
   procedures (dental extraction, TEE), will keep her intubated for now,
   but may be extubated soon.
   -          pressure support
   -          bolus sedation so that mental status can be assessed
   7.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   -          fluid boluses for low urine output
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          really dose all medications

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 18-year-old female with an odontogenic infection that has led to cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient has shown improvement in her neurological exam and is now able to raise her right eyelid with mild reactivity to the right eye. She will resume anticoagulation after tooth extraction and may require platelet transfusion.
- The patient is also suspected to have meningitis, likely caused by inflammation of the meninges due to the cavernous venous thrombus. Her white blood cell count is markedly elevated on lumbar puncture (LP) with negative gram stain. HSV PCR and bacterial culture results are pending.
- The patient has sepsis with GNR bacteremia, possibly including fusobacterium given the dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles. She is hemodynamically improving off pressors.
- The patient has a dental infection, likely originating from her right upper wisdom tooth, which has spread to the pterygoid muscle. Dental extraction, platelet transfusion prior to extraction, and drainage of the pterygoid muscle abscess are recommended.
- The patient has septic emboli seen on chest CT, with a possible renal infarct, indicating left and right-sided infarction. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with bubble study will be performed in the operating"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right ptosis and
   dilated pupil upon admission with stable neuro exam.  Getting
   anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT of 50-60.  Will
   transfuse platelets if < 50, though stable today after platelet
   transfusion yesterday prior to dental extraction.  Remains on broad
   spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin after tooth extraction
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          Minimize sedation to monitor neuro exam (will switch
   -          Vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   2.       ?Meningitis.  Likely inflammation of meniniges due to
   cavernous venous thrombus.  WBC markedly elevated on LP with negative
   gram stain.  HSV PCR , bacterial culture pending.
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          consider stopping acyclovir if hsv pcr is negative
   -          appreciate ID recs
   -          f/u blood cultures from OSH
   3.       Sepsis.  Has GNR bacteremia, ?fusobactermia given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles.  Hemodynamically improving off
   pressors.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir
   -          monitor urine output
   Thrombocytopenia
   .
   2.       Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   -          dental extraction
   -          transfuse platelets prior to dental extraction
   -          drainage of pterygoid muscle abscess
   3.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  Had
   echo yesterday but no bubble study.  Will get TEE with buble study in
   OR today.
   -          bubble study / TEE today
   4.       DIC.   Fibrinogen initially trending down, but now in 400s.
   Platelets stable at 50.  INR remains stable at around 1.6.  Fibrin
   split product mildly rising.  Given that patient has low grade DIC,
   concern for anticoagulation, but will pursue anticoagulation given
   improvement in morbitiy with this approach.
   -          serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   -          transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
   -          appreciate heme recs
   5.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   -          appreciate neuro recs
   6.       Respiratory failureure.  Patient is requiring less and less
   vent support.  Had RSBI this morning of 50.  Given need for several
   procedures (dental extraction, TEE), will keep her intubated for now,
   but may be extubated soon.
   -          pressure support
   -          bolus sedation so that mental status can be assessed
   7.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   -          fluid boluses for low urine output
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          really dose all medications

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and treatment. 

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is anticoagulated with heparin to prevent thrombus formation. Neurological exam should be monitored, and platelets should be transfused if the level falls below 50.

2. Meningitis: The patient has inflammation of the meninges due to the cavernous venous thrombus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and consideration should be given to stopping acyclovir if HSV PCR is negative.

3. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and possible fusobacteremia given the dental source. Hemodynamic stability is improving, and culture data from Hospital1 608 should be followed up.

4. Dental infection: The patient appears to have a right upper wisdom tooth infection that spread to the pterygoid muscle. Dental extraction has been performed, and platelets were transfused prior to the procedure.

5. Septic emboli: The patient has septic emboli on chest CT with possible renal infarct, indicating left and right-sided infarction. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with bubble study will be conducted to further evaluate"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, can decrease rate to
   1150.
   -          Monitor neurological exam
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, ?d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate) for further
   evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given dental
   source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl/acyclovir\
   4.        Thrombocytopenia.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable.  Thrombocytopenia likely
   secondary to DIC.
   - follow platelets
   .
   5.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].  Only able to drain a few ccs
   from parapharyngeal and masticator space.
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery
   -          drain removal tomorrow
   6.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct with
   ?renal infarct concerning for left and right sided infarction.  TEE
   showed no ASD, though did not evaluate with agitated saline for PFO.
   7.       DIC.   Fibrinogen falling today.  Platelets stable. INR
   trending down, now 1.5.  Fibrin split product mildly rising.  Given
   that patient has low grade DIC, concern for anticoagulation, but will
   pursue anticoagulation given improvement in morbitiy with this
   approach.
    - serial DIC labs (q6 hours)
   - transfuse platelets, cryo as needed
            - appreciate heme recs
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   9.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is requiring less and less vent
   support.  Will likely extubate today
   - continue with pressure support
   - propofol for sedation
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads yesterday and got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  monitor creatinine
   - really dose all medications

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 18-year-old female with likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient has septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is being treated with anticoagulation using heparin. She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- There is a possibility of a temporal lobe abscess, but no intervention is planned at this time.
- The patient has sepsis with GNR bacteremia, likely caused by Fusobacterium.
- Thrombocytopenia is present, which is likely secondary to DIC.
- The patient has a dental infection that spread to the pterygoid muscle.
- Septic emboli have been found in the chest CT, with possible renal infarction.
- The patient has low-grade DIC with stable platelets but falling fibrinogen and mildly rising fibrin split products.
- Elevated intracranial pressure is present, but neuro exam remains unchanged.
- The patient is requiring less ventilator support and may be extubated today.
- Renal failure is resolving, and the patient has received several contrast loads yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis - the patient is at risk of worsening neurological symptoms and potential complications related to anticoagulation therapy.
2. Possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock. He has been receiving various treatments including heparin, vancomycin, midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The patient's condition has been stable, with some changes in his neurological status. He has cranial nerve abnormalities, including ptosis and an eye movement deficit, as well as potential delirium. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a tracheostomy in place. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 51 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 133/70 to 140/89 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 91%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels, indicating an ongoing infection and inflammation. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 100-240 mg/dL. The patient has acute kidney injury, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level. Other lab abnormalities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the presence of ARDS and potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation will be necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1200/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate, but seems
   unlikely this morning
 unable to sit still) for further evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis/shock.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given
   dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Likely Lemierres with septic emboli plus cavernous sinus thrombosis.
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate, other culture
   data
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl and follow ID recs.
   4.    Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated yesterday and doing
   well.  Has known septic emboli as above.
   - continue O2 support as needed.
   - consider repeat CT chest at some point.
   - small dose (10 IV) lasix today.
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable, >100.  F
gen stable.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC [**Hospital1 **] (q6-8 hours)
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery.
   -          drain removal today.
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
                         - consider reimage chest at some point to
   evaluate evolution.
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.  Per neuro, papilledema of R eye
   resolved.
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  keep euvolemic if planning further contrast loads.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle.
   >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle) and meningeal inflammation. She currently has
   a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the
   dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the neck pain this is
   concerning for a anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). At present we
   have elected to cover infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime
   and Vancomycin. Will cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis.  We also have added Acyclovir to cover for HSV and will
   continue until we have neg clx data. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data which shows significantly lower
   morbidity with anticoagulation. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.
   TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she had no
   PFO)
   - Abx as above as well. increasing vanco to 1 g IV q8h (given low level
   on q 12 dosing and will check
   - Vigileo with flow track for contins monitoring of the SI and CI and
   optimization of the fluid balance
   - Q 8 hr lactate
   - Goal UOP 0.5 cc/kg/hr
   -  Re clx for fever (blood, urine) [**12-29**]. Cont to follow up initial Clx
   data (now in our system)
   - Will discuss new imaging head and sinus CT with neurosurgery and OMF
   [**Doctor First Name 213**]. .
   - F/u CSF studies: HSV (cont acyclovir)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. Has
   remained on PS and is doing very well with minimal vent support.. Will
   remain intubated pending further discussion with OMF and neurosurg  (ie
   further procedures)
   - PS ventilation, pulmonary toilet
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive. She has continued to increase her fibrinogen
   and her plts responded appropriately
   - Follow DIC labs
   >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: seems to be consistent with at least some component of
   pre-renal , despite clinical signs there is no evidence TTP. She has
   improved markedly over the past 24hrs. Given the multiple contrast
   loads we will continue NAC and IV hydration and cont to monitor
   electrolyte function.
   - let her set I/O goal

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a history of right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. She has undergone tooth removal and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. The patient's current condition includes cavernous sinus thrombosis with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe, meningitis, and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Anaerobic infection: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a possible anaerobic infection, which can lead to severe systemic complications if not appropriately managed.

2. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement: The presence of cavernous sinus thrombosis and extension to the dura of the temporal lobe indicates potential CNS involvement. This may result in neurological complications such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or brain abscesses.

3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated INR, PTT, low platelets, and elevated D-dimer suggest the development of DIC. DIC is a serious condition characterized by systemic activation of blood clotting, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and increased mortality.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. Pre-renal causes of renal failure should be considered and managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a history of right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle), and cavernous sinus thrombosis. She underwent removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle, followed by extubation on 12-30.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sinus cavernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: The patient has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. This is concerning for an anaerobic process (ie fusobacterium). The infection is being covered broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime, and Vancomycin. Dexamethasone is being continued for cavernous sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation with a goal aPTT 50-60 is being initiated due to the risk of thrombosis.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral septic pulmonary emboli and has been extubated successfully.
3. DIC/Anemia: The patient has DIC physiology with elevated INR, PTT (mild), and decreased platelets. This is likely due to her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. Supportive care is being provided, and DIC labs will be followed closely.
4. Anticoagulation: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a history of right-sided ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. She was admitted with these symptoms and has undergone tooth removal, exploration of the pterygoid muscle, and extubation. The patient currently has cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. There is concern for an anaerobic process, specifically fusobacterium. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin), dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis, and anticoagulation with a goal aPTT of 50-60.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sinusitis: The patient's symptoms of neck pain and cavernous sinus thrombosis suggest a possible anaerobic infection. This could lead to worsening sinusitis and further complications.
2. Septic Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. If not managed appropriately, this can result in severe respiratory distress and potential organ failure.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has DIC with elevated INR, ptt (mild), decreased plts, inappropriately low fibrinogen, and elevated F"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present).
   - Plan for repeat MRI with gad (as soon as she can tolerate from a resp
   standpoint)
   - Steroid taper (cut dose to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and with slightly increased O2 requirement and a worsening
   CXR (consistent with volume), there are definite septic emboli which
   are also likely contributing to V/Q mismatch.
   - Pulm toilet: OOB to chair,
   - Goal net out 500 cc to 1L
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive.  We will cont to follow very closely,
   concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
    >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
   -  follow electrolytes closely
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: appreciate SLP cont mechanical ground and
   advance as tolerate

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. She underwent tooth removal and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. The patient is now extubated but has worsening respiratory failure due to bilateral septic pulmonary emboli. She also has a history of sinusitis, DIC, anemia, renal failure, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: The patient's condition suggests the presence of a cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as vision loss, cranial nerve palsies, and meningitis.
2. Septic Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has developed bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, which are clots that have traveled from the bloodstream to the lungs. These emboli can cause respiratory failure and further complications like pneumonia or pulmonary hypertension.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient shows signs of DIC, a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. This can lead to bleeding and organ damage if not managed properly.
4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory function indicates hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure"

   blood (anaerobic bottle: presumed fusobacterium) and meningeal
   inflammation. She currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the
   right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN
   conjunction with the neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic
   process (ie fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover
   infection broadly with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin. Will
   cont dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently
   being anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input), likely to remove drain today. Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV
   is neg and we will stop the Acyclovir [**12-31**].

   data (now in our system: prelim info is fusobacterium)
   - discuss with Neurosurgery re: timing of repeat MRI. Per Neurosurg
   team there is no plan for intervention based on current lesion location
   and size.

   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present).

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1000/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl
   -          Taper dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider repeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   4.  Respiratory distress.  Now fluid positive several days in a row and
   more tachypneic with increased SOB.  Likely fluid overload on top of
   septic emboli.
   - lasix 10IV prn SOB with goal negative of [**2-18**] L
   - follow Is/Os
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.       Elevated INR.  Likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional
   deficiency.  DIC labs overall seem to be improving so less likely to be
   secondary to worsening DIC.  Will give vitamin K for three days.
   -          vitamin k
   -          follow INR
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia, and elevated INR. She has been diagnosed with septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, possible temporal lobe abscess, respiratory distress, and septic emboli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is at risk for worsening of the thrombosis, leading to increased pressure and potential neurological deficits.
2. Possible temporal lobe abscess: There is a risk of the abscess progressing and causing further neurological complications or spread of infection.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to hypoxia and potential respiratory failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count may continue to decrease, leading to increased bleeding risk.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR indicates a higher risk of bleeding, especially if the cause is due to antibiotic use or nutritional deficiency.
6. Septic emboli: The patient is at risk for additional septic emboli, which can lead to organ infarction or other complications.

Please note that these are potential complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient's blood cultures from Hospital1 were positive for Fusobacterium. The patient has been started on Afrin and Nasal saline sprays for sinusitis. The patient's PTT was initially elevated but has since improved. The patient is on a heparin drip and has shown signs of improving coagulation profile. The patient's renal function has been signed off, and acyclovir was stopped due to negative HSV PCR results. Neurology recommends a repeat MRI with gadolinium, antibiotic therapy for 4-6 weeks, and consideration of steroid taper. The patient's source of infection may be related to a dental issue, as cultures from a dental extraction remain negative. The patient is experiencing increasing shortness of breath and tachypnea, with supplemental oxygen increased and Lasix 10 IV given. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving various antibiotics, including Acyclovir, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 144/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Meningitis picture
   also explained by this diagnosis.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1200/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          cefepime/flagyl/vanc, d/c acyclovir.
   -          Continue dexamethasone
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs.
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today (if can tolerate, but seems
   unlikely this morning
 unable to sit still) for further evaluation.
   3.       Sepsis/shock.  GNR bacteremia, likely fusobacterium given
   dental source and growth in anaerobic bottles (final ID pending).
   Likely Lemierres with septic emboli plus cavernous sinus thrombosis.
   Hemodynamically improved.
   -          f/u culture data from [**Hospital1 608**]
   -          f/u pharyngeal and masticator space aspirate, other culture
   data
   -          continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl and follow ID recs.
   4.    Respiratory failure.  Patient extubated yesterday and doing
   well.  Has known septic emboli as above.
   - continue O2 support as needed.
   - consider repeat CT chest at some point.
   - small dose (10 IV) lasix today.
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  Received platelets prior to dental
   extraction, but platelets now stable, >100.  F
gen stable.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs (q6-8 hours)
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.        Dental infection.  Appears to have right upper wisdom tooth
   infection which spread to pterygoid muscle.  Has GNRs in blood cultures
   from [**Hospital1 608**] in anaerobic bottles concerning for ?fusobacterium.
   Underwent dental extraction on [**2105-12-29**].
   -          f/u cultures from dental surgery.
   -          drain removal today.
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
                         - consider reimage chest at some point to
   evaluate evolution.
   8.       Elevated intracranial pressure.  Found to have opening pressur
   of 51 on LP, however was intubated with high peep.  Neuro exam is
   unchanged.  Given DIC, will hold off on serial LPs but will consider if
   there is evidence of worsening ICP.  Per neuro, papilledema of R eye
   resolved.
   9.       Renal failure.  Pre-renal ARF is resolving.  Seen by renal who
   does not feel this is consistent with TTP-HUS.  Received several
   contrast loads in past few days, got mucomyst and hydration.
   - fluid boluses for low urine output
   -  keep euvolemic if planning further contrast loads.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18-year-old female with likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, possible temporal lobe abscess, sepsis/shock, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia/DIC, dental infection, septic emboli, elevated intracranial pressure, and renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's right ptosis and dilated pupil indicate a serious complication of the infection spreading to the cavernous sinus. Anticoagulation with heparin is being used to prevent further clotting.
2. Possible temporal lobe abscess: The head CT showed hypodensity in the temporal lobe, which may indicate an abscess. Neurological evaluation is necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Sepsis/shock: The patient has GNR bacteremia, likely caused by fusobacterium due to the dental source. This could lead to septic shock, and close monitoring of vital signs is required.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated. Oxygen support may still be needed due to septic emboli and potential lung complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia/D"

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present).
   - Plan for repeat MRI today
   - Steroid taper (dose was cut to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, and volume
   overload. Improved with diuresis (CXR looks better and sx are better)
   - Pulm toilet: OOB to chair,
   - Goal net out 500 cc to 1L
   >DIC: PLT improving
   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
   - Started vitamin K
    >Anticoagulation: anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K , INR<2.5
   then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: appreciate SLP cont mechanical ground and
   advance as tolerate

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specifica
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present).
   - Plan for repeat MRI with gad (as soon as she can tolerate from a resp
   standpoint)
   - Steroid taper (cut dose to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, now
   extubated and with slightly increased O2 requirement and a worsening
   CXR (consistent with volume), there are definite septic emboli which
   are also likely contributing to V/Q mismatch.
   - Pulm toilet: OOB to chair,
   - Goal net out 500 cc to 1L
   >DIC/Anemia: DIC physiology with elevated INR, ptt (mild) and decreased
   plts with inappropriately low fibrinogen and elevated FDP. The most
   likely explanation is her evolving GNR bacteremia/meningitis. For now
   our care is supportive.  We will cont to follow very closely,
   concerned. Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow DIC lab. Unclear why the INR is rising, ? related to heparin
   vs nutriotional deficiency (Vit K).
    >Anticoagulation: will anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K ,
   INR<2.5 then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60.
   >Renal failure: initially pre-renal, and now resolved. She conts to do
   well.
   - Will gently diurese today.
   -  follow electrolytes closely
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input
   > Swallowing function: appreciate SLP cont mechanical ground and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle), and cavernous sinus thrombosis. She also has sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient underwent removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Cavernous sinus thrombosis with septic emboli and sepsis syndrome: The patient has an ongoing infection with GNR bacteria, specifically fusobacterium, which has caused cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin) are being used to cover the infection, along with dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation but was extubated recently. She now has slightly increased oxygen requirements due to septic pulmonary emboli contributing to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary toilet measures and careful fluid management are planned.

3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has DIC with elevated INR, prolonged PTT, decreased platelets, inappropriately low fibrinogen"

   Assessment and Plan
 In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis,
   Fusobacterium bacteremia, and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  On flagyl ceftriaxone for prolonged course.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 900/hr
   (recheck this AM)
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl; ?need IV ?need PICC
   -          Tapered dexamethasone to 10 mg IV q12, further taper pending
   ID/neuro recs.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Eepeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it (will attempt)
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   3.  Dyspnea.  Diuresed yesterday with improvement in SOB and CXR.
   Likely fluid overload on top of known septic emboli.
   - Goal 500-1L negative today (was quite negative yesterday
 3L); lasix
   prn.
   4.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, though
   elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
           -    trying vitamin K x 3 days
   .
   5.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.
   6.       Delerium.  Had post extubation agitation and some bizarre
   behavior.  Significantly improved today; seems to be at baseline now.
                        - minimize mind altering meds; tapering steroids

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a likely odontogenic infection that has resulted in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She is currently being treated with anticoagulation therapy, antibiotics, and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is experiencing right ptosis and a dilated pupil, which are signs of this condition. She is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin to address the thrombus formation. Monitoring of neurological exam and mental status is crucial.

2. Possible temporal lobe abscess: A head CT showed temporal lobe hypodensity, which could indicate an abscess. Neurology and neurosurgery recommendations should be followed, and an MRI with gadolinium may be considered for further evaluation.

3. Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath is likely due to fluid overload and septic emboli. Diuretics have been used to manage the fluid overload, and it is important to continue monitoring and providing supportive care.

4. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient initially had low platelet counts and evidence of DIC. However, her platelet count has improved, and DIC seems to be improving as well. Vitamin K has been administered for three days, and serial DIC labs should be followed.

5. Septic emboli: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 18 year old female with likely
   odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR
   bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and DIC.
   1.  Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.  Patient noted to have right
   ptosis and dilated pupil upon admission with subsequent stable neuro
   exam.  Getting anticoagulated with heparin for thrombus with goal PTT
   of 50-60.  Will transfuse platelets if < 50, though have been well
   above that.  Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -          Anticoagulation with heparin as above, continue at 1000/hr.
   -          Monitor neurological exam and mental status exam very
   closely.
   -          Ceftriaxone/flagyl
   -          Taper dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12
   -          Followup cultures.
   -          Appreciate ID, neurology, neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider repeat imaging (MRI) today if can tolerate it
   2.       Possible temporal lobe abscess.  Head CT showed temporal lobe
   hypodensity with concern for possible abscess vs. inflammation vs.
   artifact.  Discussed with neurology and neurosurgery; no plan for
   intervention.
   -          F/u neurosurgery recs
   -          Consider MRI with gad today
   4.  [**Known lastname **] distress.  Now fluid positive several days in a row and
   more tachypneic with increased SOB.  Likely fluid overload on top of
   septic emboli.
   - lasix 10IV prn SOB with goal negative of [**2-18**] L
   - follow Is/Os
   5.        Thrombocytopenia/DIC.  DIC overall seems to be improving
   platelets up dramatically, stable fibrinogen, rising INR, elevated FDP.
           -   follow platelets; should not need further transfusion given
   improvement.
           -   serial DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
           -   appreciate heme recs
   .
   6.       Elevated INR.  Likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional
   deficiency.  DIC labs overall seem to be improving so less likely to be
   secondary to worsening DIC.  Will give vitamin K for three days.
   -          vitamin k
   -          follow INR
   7.       Septic emboli.  Found to have septic emboli on chest ct
   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname**] is an 18-year-old female with a likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, GNR bacteremia (likely Fusobacterium), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has septic cavernous sinus thrombosis, a possible temporal lobe abscess, thrombocytopenia/DIC, elevated INR, and septic emboli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection and prevent further clotting.
2. Possible temporal lobe abscess: This requires close monitoring and may require intervention such as drainage or surgical exploration.
3. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is low, but it is improving. Further transfusion may not be necessary.
4. Elevated INR: This is likely secondary to antibiotics and nutritional deficiency. The patient is being given vitamin K for three days.
5. Septic emboli: The patient has septic emboli in her lungs, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
6. Renal infarct: The patient may have a renal infarct, which could affect kidney function.
7. Potential systemic lesions: There are no other identified potential systemic lesions, but ongoing monitoring is required.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and ongoing use of antibiotics indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels suggest the possibility of ARDS.
3. Cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient's diagnosis of cavernous venous thrombosis indicates a potential risk for complications related to this condition.
4. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate acute renal failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's low respiratory rate and need for respiratory support indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure.
6. Delirium/confusion: The patient's altered mental status and delirium/confusion assessment suggest a risk for further cognitive decline.
7. DVT prophylaxis: The patient's risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) needs to be monitored closely due to the presence of central venous catheters and immobilization.
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient"

   (consistent with diagnosis of Lemierres).   Also with ?renal infarct
   concerning for left and right sided infarction.  No other identified
   potential systemic lesions.  TEE showed no ASD, though did not evaluate
   with agitated saline for PFO.  No vegetations.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 18-year-old female with likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient has right ptosis and dilated pupil, indicating neurological involvement.
- She is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) for a prolonged course.
- The patient's neurological exam and mental status should be closely monitored.
- There is a concern for possible temporal lobe abscess, with imaging studies recommended.
- The patient experienced dyspnea, which was likely due to fluid overload and septic emboli. Diuretics were given, and the goal is to maintain negative fluid balance.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia and DIC, which are improving with treatment. Close monitoring of platelets and DIC labs is necessary.
- Septic emboli were found on chest CT, along with potential renal infarct. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no atrial septal defect (ASD) but did not evaluate for patent foramen ovale (PFO).
- The patient had delirium post-extubation but has significantly improved.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a likely odontogenic infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She is currently receiving anticoagulation with heparin, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), and steroids (tapered dexamethasone). There are concerns about a possible temporal lobe abscess, dyspnea, thrombocytopenia/DIC, septic emboli, and delirium. The patient is being closely monitored for neurological and mental status changes. Further evaluations and consultations are needed from neurology, neurosurgery, and hematology. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is already receiving appropriate treatment with anticoagulation and antibiotics. Close monitoring of neurological exam and mental status is essential.
2. Possible temporal lobe abscess: Neurology and neurosurgery consultations are necessary to determine if intervention is required. An MRI with gadolinium may provide more information.
3. Dyspnea: The patient may be experiencing fluid overload on top of septic emboli. Diuresis with lasix should continue to achieve a negative fluid balance.
4. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is improving, and fibrinogen levels are stable. INR is rising, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a likely odontogenic infection that has resulted in cavernous sinus thrombosis, Fusobacterium bacteremia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and antibiotics for her condition. The patient's neurological exam has been stable, but she continues to experience numbness in the V1-V2 distribution. Her vital signs are generally stable, although her blood pressure is on the lower side. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 745 mL. Laboratory results indicate improvements in platelet count and fibrinogen levels, with stable INR and elevated FDP. The patient is expected to receive further recommendations from ID, neurology, and neurosurgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: The patient is already receiving appropriate treatment with anticoagulation and antibiotics. Close monitoring of neurological exam and mental status is necessary.
2. Thrombocytopenia/DIC: The patient's platelet count is improving, and there are no signs of further transfusion needed. Serial DIC labs should be followed, and recommendations from the hematology department should be appreciated.
3. Dyspnea: The patient has shown improvement in dyspnea and chest X-ray findings after diuresis. It is important to allow the patient to autodiurese on her own and keep her negative daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Sinus carvernous thrombosis with GNR in blood and sepsis: R in the
   blood (anaerobic bottle: fusobacterium) and meningeal inflammation. She
   currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis along the right side with
   extension to the dura of the temporal lobe. IN conjunction with the
   neck pain this is concerning for a anaerobic process (ie
   fusobacterium). At present we have elected to cover infection broadly
   with Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). Will cont
   dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specific
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   In conferring with ID we decided to change the Abx
   regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and
   continuing Metronidazole. MRI brain without evidence of abscess.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present). Will d/w
   ID re: possibility of PO Abx vs need for PICC line
   - Steroid taper (dose was cut to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
   - Will clarify duration of course (if prolonged
 will need bactrim
   ppx)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, and volume
   overload. Improved significantly with diuresis (CXR looks much better
   and sx are better). She is now on RA.
   - Pulm toilet: OOB to chair
   - Goal net out 500 cc to 1L
    >Anticoagulation: anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K , INR<2.5
   then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60. Likely will continue while inpatient and
   stop before going home.
   > Sinusitis: conservative management with affrin and NS nasal, broad
   spectrum Abx. Appreciate ENT input

","The patient is an 18-year-old female with a chief complaint of cavernous sinus thrombosis secondary to an odontogenic infection and Lemierre syndrome, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She also has bacteremia with fusobacterium and meningeal inflammation.

The patient's recent history includes the removal of tooth #1 and exploration of the pterygoid muscle. She was extubated on 12-30. Her current conditions include sinus cavernous thrombosis with fusobacterium in the blood, sepsis, and DIC.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/64 mmHg to 135/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Her heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

Physical examination reveals diminished but present response to light in the right pupil, clear breath sounds with decreased bases, and warm skin. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, place, and person, and exhibits purposeful movement.

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3635**]. Findings and plan
   reflect our discussion.
   18 yo female with admission with right sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia,
   neck erythema, with GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) and cavernous
   sinus thrombosis complicated by DIC now s/p removal of tooth #1 and
   exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on [**12-30**].
    >Cavernous sinus thrombosis with fusobacterium bacteremia and
   meningeal inflammation. She currently has a cavernous sinus thrombosis
   along the right side with extension to the dura of the temporal lobe..
   At present we have elected to cover infection broadly with
   Metronidazole, Cefepime and Vancomycin (initially). In conferring with
   ID we decided to change the Abx regimen to high dose Ceftriaxone
   (stopping Vancomycin and Cefepime) and continuing Metronidazole.
   Dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is currently being
   anti-coagulated with a goal apt for 50-60 for cavernous sinus
   thrombosis as there is a body of data  (see chart for specific
   references) which shows significantly lower morbidity with
   anticoagulation and one reference which demonstrates decreased
   mortality. ID team agrees with anti-coagulation.  Appreciate ID team
   input. TEE was negative for ASD (not specifically mentioned that she
   had no PFO) and she has had the #1 tooth removed (appreciate OMF
   input).Of late, her CSF for  HSV and EBV is neg and we stopped
   Acyclovir [**12-31**].   MRI brain without evidence of abscess.
   - Abx as above, with a planned [**5-24**] week course. Will plan for PICC
   placement (but defer for now based on anti-coag at present). Will d/w
   ID re: possibility of PO Abx vs need for PICC line
   - Steroid taper (dose was cut to dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 12h)
   - Will clarify duration of course (if prolonged
 will need bactrim
   ppx)
    >Hypoxemic resp failure: bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, and volume
   overload. Improved significantly with diuresis (CXR looks much better
   and sx are better). She is now on RA.
    >Anticoagulation: anticoagulate wit IV heparin. If PLts <50K , INR<2.5
   then stop. Goal aPTT 50-60. Likely will continue while inpatient and
   stop before going home.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female admitted with right-sided ptosis, opthalmoplegia, neck erythema, and GNR bacteremia (anaerobic bottle) complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient underwent tooth removal and exploration of the pterygoid muscle with extubation on 12/30. The current diagnosis includes cavernous sinus thrombosis with fusobacterium bacteremia and meningeal inflammation. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole, cefepime, and vancomycin), high-dose ceftriaxone, and dexamethasone for cavernous sinus thrombosis. She is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin to target an aPTT of 50-60 due to the cavernous sinus thrombosis. Other conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, bilateral septic pulmonary emboli, and volume overload, which have improved significantly with diuresis. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, and her neurological status is stable. Imaging studies show no evidence of abscess or other complications. The patient's blood work indicates some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient is ready for transfer to the floor.
