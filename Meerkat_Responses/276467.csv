   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed
   cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30%, who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] w/ symptoms
   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for
   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, admitted to CCU for
   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated overnight for acute-onset of severe
   respiratory distress that was non-responsive to treatment for
   anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after completion of ASA
   desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic reaction to the ASA,
   however the pt did not respond appropriately to treatment of such. He
   also did not respond to treatment of other possible causes of
   respiratory failure in the DDx.
   - check RSBI, attempt SBT and extubation today
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization
   - continue to treat CHF, COPD, and anxiety as below
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - Allergy consult regarding use of ASA now s/p desensitization but with
   ? anaphylactic response
   - viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability, for
   potential PCI of mid-LAD lesion: MRI vs. Thallium, may be done as
   outpatient
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis at OSH prior to transfer, but still overloaded by symptoms
   and exam.
   - continue diuresis with IV Lasix boluses
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   - check TTE for LV function, EF, wall-motion abnormalities, and
   possible apical thrombus
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction.
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization, ? use of ASA going forward
   - PRN Epinephrine, Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, Pepcid
   .
   # ? Apical thromus: OSH TTE unable to adequately assess apex for
   thrombus.
   - continue IV heparin gtt, weight-based protocol
   - f/u TTE to eval for presence of apical thrombus
   - consider bridge to coumadin
   .
   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Now intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress of unknown etiology.
   - continue Solu-Medrol for aggressive treatment of possible COPD
   exacerbation
   - continue Advair, Spiriva

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with severe COPD and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for aspirin desensitization and viability study.

The patient developed severe respiratory distress overnight, which did not respond to treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, congestive heart failure (CHF), or anxiety. This suggests a potential medical complication of respiratory failure. The respiratory support section indicates that the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy. The cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant coronary circulation with diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout, mid-vessel 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60% stenosis in the left circumflex artery (LCx).

The patient's rhythm is noted as normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and frequent atrial premature complexes (APCs) and ventricular premature complexes (VPCs). Electrolyte repletion is planned to"

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed
   cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30%, who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] w/ symptoms
   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for
   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, admitted to CCU for
   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated for approximately 12 hours for
   acute-onset of severe respiratory distress that was non-responsive to
   treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after
   completion of ASA desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic
   reaction to the ASA, however the pt did not respond appropriately to
   treatment of such. He also did not respond to treatment of other
   possible causes of respiratory failure in the DDx. Seen by allergy, who
   feel this was anaphylactic reaction to ASA. Would recommend repeat
   trial at desensitization after 2 weeks given current respiratory status
   and COPD flare after reaction.
   - continue to treat COPD and CHF as below
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis, now appears more euvolemic. Repeat TTE here showed EF 15%,
   no wall-motion abnormalities to suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   - change IV Lasix to dialy PO dose
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry, electrolyte repletion
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis. TTE without wall-motion abnormalities to suggest ischemia as
   cause of cardiomyopathy.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - per Allergy, would wait 2 weeks before re-trying ASA desensitization
   given anaphylactic response, no ASA for now
   - will not need viability study or repeat PCI as ischemia not the
   likely cause of cardiomyopathy
   .
   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress likely anaphylactic, which exacerbated underlying severe COPD.
   - change Solu-Medrol to PO Prednisone for rapid taper
   - continue Advair, Spiriva
   - PRN albuterol / ipratropium MDIs
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction. Per Allergy, will need to wait 2 weeks before re-trying ASA
   desensitization.
   .
   # ? Apical thromus: OSH TTE unable to adequately assess apex for
   thrombus. Repeat TTE here w/o any thrombus. Heparin stopped.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and was transferred to the cardiac catheterization unit for a viability study. During the ASA desensitization protocol, he experienced acute respiratory distress, which may have been an anaphylactic reaction. The patient was intubated for approximately 12 hours due to severe respiratory failure that did not respond to treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, congestive heart failure (CHF), or anxiety. He is currently extubated and receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 87/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His physical examination reveals mild labored respiration, scattered wheezes, and a prolonged expiratory phase. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, and magnesium levels. The assessment and plan include treatment for adverse drug event (ADR), hemorrhage/hematoma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, pump failure, rhythm disturbances, and coronary artery disease."

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed
   cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30%, who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] w/ symptoms
   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for
   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, admitted to CCU for
   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated overnight for acute-onset of severe
   respiratory distress that was non-responsive to treatment for
   anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after completion of ASA
   desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic reaction to the ASA,
   however the pt did not respond appropriately to treatment of such. He
   also did not respond to treatment of other possible causes of
   respiratory failure in the DDx.
   - check RSBI, attempt SBT and extubation today
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization
   - continue to treat CHF, COPD, and anxiety as below
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - Allergy consult regarding use of ASA now s/p desensitization but with
   ? anaphylactic response
   - viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability, for
   potential PCI of mid-LAD lesion: MRI vs. Thallium, may be done as
   outpatient
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis at OSH prior to transfer, but still overloaded by symptoms
   and exam.
   - continue diuresis with IV Lasix boluses
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   - check TTE for LV function, EF, wall-motion abnormalities, and
   possible apical thrombus
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction.
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization, ? use of ASA going forward
   - PRN Epinephrine, Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, Pepcid
   .
   # ? Apical thromus: OSH TTE unable to adequately assess apex for
   thrombus.
   - continue IV heparin gtt, weight-based protocol
   - f/u TTE to eval for presence of apical thrombus
   - consider bridge to coumadin

   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Now intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress of unknown etiology.
   - continue Solu-Medrol for aggressive treatment of possible COPD
   exacerbation
   - continue Advair, Spiriva

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and was transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab for a procedure that showed left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease. 

The patient was admitted to the coronary critical care unit (CCU) for aspirin desensitization and viability study. However, overnight, the patient experienced acute respiratory distress and required intubation. Despite treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure (CHF), and anxiety, the patient did not respond appropriately. This suggests the possibility of an anaphylactic reaction to aspirin, despite previous desensitization.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and was found to have diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout the left-dominant coronary system, with mid-vessel 80% stenosis in the LAD and 60% stenosis in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient will continue on Plavix, lisinopril, and beta-blocker medications. A viability study is planned to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability, potentially for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the"
