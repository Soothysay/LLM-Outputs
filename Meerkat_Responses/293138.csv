   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and
   recent hospitalized for rectal perf, small bowel prolapse with necrosis
   s/p rectocolectomy and perc chole for acalc cholecystitis with course
   c/b pneumonia and c diff. transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] with septic
   shock.
   #. SEPTIC SHOCK: Patient with leukocytosis and tachypnea at
   presentation. Overnight, tachycardic intermittently. Afebrile.
   Therefore meets SIRS criteria. Has many potential sources for
   infection, including intraabdominal given recent surgery, UTI,
   pneumonia, bacteremia, cellulitis. Intraabdominal process most likely
   given complicated surgical course. Large open surgical wound which was
   debrided within past 3-4 days. Also with development of significant
   peritoneal symptoms overnight. On CT abdomen/pelvis, patient with free
   fluid which certain could be infected. Lactate surprisingly normal thus
   far. In terms of UTI, large LE with WBCs and and moderate bacteria. In
   terms of pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity on chest radiograph lilkely
   hernia but could be consolidation; patient also reported productive
   cough on presentation. In terms of bacteremia, patient had invasive
   surgery and PICC placed at OSH. In terms of cellulitis, patient with
   skin tears on buttocks and right leg although no evidence of cellultis
   at these sites or surrounding open wound on abdomen.
   - Patient not interested in having surgery or central line placement;
   unable to place arterial line yesterday
   - Discuss with surgery options for wound care to minimize discomfort
   - 1 pressor (Levophed) + IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>60
   - Await final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics given exact source of infection is unknown
   (IV zosyn/vanco/flagyl and PO vanco)
        - Vancomycin will need to be redosed
 initially only given 1 dose
   [**3-19**] renal failure
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - Consider obtaining abdominal wound cultures
   - Trend WBC cound and fever curve
   - Stress dose steroids
   - Monitor lactate
   #. PAIN CONTROL: Significant pain associated with open wound +
   peritonitis by exam
   - Fentanyl patch
   - Given that patch will take 24 hours to take effect, standing morphine
   today with prn doses for breakthrough pain
   #. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - ASA held currently given INR so elevated
   - Statin held pending ability to take POs
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   #. LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA: Likely secondary to IVF + oliguria +
   compression from BP cuff
   - Release BP cuff to assess for resolution
   - If continued asymmetric edema, consider ultrasound to assess for clot
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get
   arterial gas as she is clamped down on pressors.
   - Serial venous gases to assess extent of acidosis.
   - Bicarb supplementation in IVF - since admission given over 300mEq
   NaHCO3
   #. ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine appears most consistently 1.5-2.0
   although she has had multiple bumps higher than this.  Likely bumped in
   the setting of septic shock. UOP poor since admission, averaging at
   less than 20cc per hour despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now to 4.3. Not on
   coumadin. Initially concerned for DIC although fibrinogen elevated
   (although not completely reliable given that it is an acute phase
   reactant). FDP and D-dimer elevated. Was given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on
   admission.
   - Continue to monitor
   - No indication for FFP, cryo, or platelets at this time
   # CHRONIC CHF: Not in overt CHF on CXR. Given septic shock will push
   fluids as possible although may become difficult balance given patient
   is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above
   # PAF: Appeared to be in rate controlled a. fib in ED. Transiently in
   atrial fibrillation overnight. Not on anticoagulation.
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   # ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE: Baseline hct appears most consistently
   high 20s-low 30s and she is currently within this baseline after
   several liters of crystalloid.  Elevated MCV and high end normal RDW.
   Iron studies in [**2195**] c/w AOCD; B12 and folate were normal at that time.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: As not critical at this time will restart
   atorvastatin at current dose once better taking POs.
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased.
   # FEN:
   - Continue to monitor lytes
   - IVFs now
   # Access:  Right PICC.
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  INR supratherapeutic.
   # Code:  DNR/DNI, no CVL
   - Plan to rediscuss goals of care with family today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, history of CABG surgery, chronic congestive heart failure, recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse with necrosis, and cholecystitis. She was transferred from another hospital due to septic shock. 

The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain with rebound tenderness, which indicates peritonitis. She has also had poor urine output, and there is evidence of hypotension and potential septic shock. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a PICC line, administration of antibiotics, and adjustment of medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including intra-abdominal, urinary tract, pneumonia, bacteremia, and cellulitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the exact source of infection is still unknown. Cultures have been obtained to guide further treatment.

2. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, and she has had multiple bumps in creatinine since admission. Her urine output has been poor, averaging less than 20cc per hour despite fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring and supportive care are necessary to maintain adequate renal function.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to high output from colostomy in the setting of Clo"

   - Bicarb supplementation in IVF - since admission given over 300mEq
   NaHCO3
   #. ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine appears most consistently 1.5-2.0
   although she has had multiple bumps higher than this.  Likely bumped in
   the setting of septic shock. UOP poor since admission, averaging at
   less than 20cc per hour despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   # COAGULOPATHY:  INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation. Not on coumadin.
   Initially concerned for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse with necrosis, and cholecystitis. The patient was transferred from another hospital with septic shock.

The patient presents with leukocytosis, tachypnea, and intermittent tachycardia, meeting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Multiple potential sources of infection are identified, including intraabdominal, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, bacteremia, and cellulitis. The most likely source of infection is intraabdominal due to the recent surgery and large open surgical wound.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. Blood and urine cultures have been obtained, and abdominal wound cultures may be considered. The patient's lactate levels are normal, which is surprising given the septic shock.

The patient also has elevated troponins, likely secondary to demand ischemia due to hypotension. She has a history of CAD with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) in [**2194**]. Telemetry and EKG show considerable ectopy, but no indication of acute ischemia. Statin and beta-blocker (BB) therapy have been held pending the ability to take oral"

   of transverse colon herniates through a large diaphragmatic defect into
   the chest. There is no pneumatosis, although further evaluation of the
   bowel for ischemic changes is limited without the use of contrast. (2)
   Small amount of pelvic free fluid. Without oral contrast, it is
   difficult to differentiate free fluid from decompressed colon and small
   bowel. (3) Suture line with small pocket of gas and fluid adjacent that
   may be post-
   surgical (2:58). (4) The gallbladder is not well seen, which may be
   contracted around the drain.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and
   recent hospitalized for rectal perf, small bowel prolapse with necrosis
   s/p rectocolectomy and perc chole for acalc cholecystitis with course
   c/b pneumonia and c diff. transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] with septic
   shock.
   #. SEPTIC SHOCK: Patient with leukocytosis and tachypnea at
   presentation. Afebrile but on steroids. Therefore meets SIRS criteria.
   Likely source of sepsis here is fungemia. Patient with yeast in blood
   (1 out of 2 cultures) and urine.
        Other potential sources of infection include intraabdominal given
   recent surgery, pneumonia, cellulitis, C diff. Intraabdominal process
   possible given complicated surgical course. Large open surgical wound
   which was debrided within past 3-4 days. On CT abdomen/pelvis, patient
   with free fluid which certain could be infected. Lactate normal (last
   check [**12-4**]). In terms of pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity on chest
   radiograph lilkely hernia but could be consolidation; patient also
   reported productive cough on presentation. In terms of cellulitis,
   patient with skin tears on buttocks and right leg although no evidence
   of cellultis at these sites or surrounding open wound on abdomen.
   Patient also with diagnosis of C diff infection at OSH.
   - Caspofungin IV started [**12-5**]; awaiting culture sensitivities
   - Discuss need for TTE, ophthalmologic consult given fungemia
   - Flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for C diff
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics (IV zosyn/vanco)
        - Vancomycin will need to be redosed
 initially only given 1 dose
   [**3-19**] renal failure
        - Will stop vancomycin IV
   - Patient not interested in having surgery or central line placement;
   unable to place arterial line on admission
   - 1 pressor (Levophed) + IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>60
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Consider obtaining abdominal wound cultures
   - Trend WBC cound and fever curve
   - Taper down steroids as may be interfering with wound healing, ?proven
   benefit
   - Monitor lactate
   #. POST-OP CARE: Significant pain associated with open wound +
   peritonitis by exam. Seen by surgery - continue wet and dry dressings.
   - Fentanyl patch with morphine prn for breakthrough pain (Fentanyl
   Patch 12 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
   - Wound care nurse to come by this morning
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now 3.2. Not on
   coumadin. Concern for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and
   D-dimer elevated. Was given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor
   - No indication for FFP, cryo, or platelets at this time
   #. LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA: Likely secondary to IVF + oliguria +
   compression from BP cuff
   - Release BP cuff to assess for resolution
   - If continued asymmetric edema, consider ultrasound to assess for clot
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get

   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Aggressive fluid bolus as large insensible losses
   #. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - ASA held currently given INR so elevated

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and
   recent hospitalized for rectal perf, small bowel prolapse with necrosis
   s/p rectocolectomy and perc chole for acalc cholecystitis with course
   c/b pneumonia and c diff. transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] with septic
   shock.
   #. SEPTIC SHOCK: Patient with leukocytosis and tachypnea at
   presentation. Afebrile but on steroids. Therefore meets SIRS criteria.
   Likely source of sepsis here is fungemia. Patient with yeast in blood
   (1 out of 2 cultures) and urine.
        Other potential sources of infection include intraabdominal given
   recent surgery, pneumonia, cellulitis, C diff. Intraabdominal process
   possible given complicated surgical course. Large open surgical wound
   which was debrided within past 3-4 days. On CT abdomen/pelvis, patient
   with free fluid which certain could be infected. Lactate normal (last
   check [**12-4**]). In terms of pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity on chest
   radiograph lilkely hernia but could be consolidation; patient also
   reported productive cough on presentation. In terms of cellulitis,
   patient with skin tears on buttocks and right leg although no evidence
   of cellultis at these sites or surrounding open wound on abdomen.
   Patient also with diagnosis of C diff infection at OSH.
   - Caspofungin IV started [**12-5**]; awaiting culture sensitivities
   - D/c PICC as potential for seeding with yeast
   - Flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for C diff
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics (IV zosyn/vanco/Flagyl)
           - Will stop vancomycin IV as 2 good definitive sources of
   infection at this time; keep on Zosyn considering open abd wound
   - Patient not interested in having surgery or central line placement;
   unable to place arterial line on admission
   - 1 pressor (Levophed) + IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>60
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Consider obtaining abdominal wound cultures
   - Trend WBC cound and fever curve
   - Taper down steroids as may be interfering with wound healing, ?proven
   benefit
   - Monitor lactate
   #. POST-OP CARE: Significant pain associated with open wound +
   peritonitis by exam. Seen by surgery - continue wet and dry dressings.
   - Fentanyl patch with morphine prn for breakthrough pain (Fentanyl
   Patch 12 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
   - Wound care nurse to come by this morning
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now 3.2. Not on
   coumadin. Concern for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and
   D-dimer elevated. Nutritional deficiency + having been on antibiotics
   since last admission likely also contributing to coagulopathy. Was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on admission.
   - Repeat vitamin K 10mg PO x1
   - Continue to monitor
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get
   arterial gas as she is hypovolemic and clamped down on pressors.
   - Serial venous gases to assess extent of acidosis.
   - Bicarb supplementation in IVF
   #. ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine appears most consistently 1.5-2.0
   although she has had multiple bumps higher than this.  Likely bumped in
   the setting of septic shock. UOP poor since admission, averaging at
   less than 20cc per hour despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Aggressive fluid bolus as large insensible losses
   #. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - ASA held currently given INR so elevated
   - Statin held pending ability to take POs
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above
   # PAF: Appeared to be in rate controlled a. fib in ED. Transiently in
   atrial fibrillation overnight. Not on anticoagulation.
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   # ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE: Baseline hct appears most consistently
   high 20s-low 30s and she is currently within this baseline after
   several liters of crystalloid.  Elevated MCV and high end normal RDW.
   Iron studies in [**2195**] c/w AOCD; B12 and folate were normal at that time.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: As not critical at this time will restart
   atorvastatin at current dose once better taking POs.
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased [**12-5**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic congestive heart failure, and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse with necrosis. She underwent a rectocolectomy and percutaneous cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis with a course complicated by pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was transferred from another hospital with septic shock.

The patient presents with leukocytosis, tachypnea, and fever, meeting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). She has yeast in her blood and urine cultures, indicating a likely fungal infection. Other potential sources of infection include intra-abdominal, pneumonia, cellulitis, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has an open surgical wound that was debrided within the past few days, and there is free fluid in the abdomen, which could be infected. She also has a retrocardiac opacity on chest radiograph, which may be a hernia or consolidation, and she reported a productive cough on presentation.

The patient's blood cultures are negative for bacterial growth, but she has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has been started on caspofungin IV for suspected fungal sepsis, and her antibiotic regimen has been adjusted accordingly.

The patient has coagulopathy with an elevated INR, elevated D-dimer, and elevated fibrinogen, which may be due to disse"

   Patch 12 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
   - Wound care nurse to come by this morning
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now 3.2. Not on
   coumadin. Concern for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and
   D-dimer elevated. Was given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on admission.
   - Continue to monitor
   - No indication for FFP, cryo, or platelets at this time
   #. LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA: Likely secondary to IVF + oliguria +
   compression from BP cuff
   - Release BP cuff to assess for resolution
   - If continued asymmetric edema, consider ultrasound to assess for clot
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get
   arterial gas as she is hypovolemic and clamped down on pressors.
   - Serial venous gases to assess extent of acidosis.
   - Bicarb supplementation in IVF
   #. ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine appears most consistently 1.5-2.0
   although she has had multiple bumps higher than this.  Likely bumped in
   the setting of septic shock. UOP poor since admission, averaging at
   less than 20cc per hour despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Aggressive fluid bolus as large insensible losses
   #. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - ASA held currently given INR so elevated
   - Statin held pending ability to take POs

   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above
   # PAF: Appeared to be in rate controlled a. fib in ED. Transiently in

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and
   recent hospitalized for rectal perf, small bowel prolapse with necrosis
   s/p rectocolectomy and perc chole for acalc cholecystitis with course
   c/b pneumonia and c diff. transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] with septic
   shock, now with fungemia and ?bacteremia.
   #. SEPTIC SHOCK: Patient with leukocytosis and tachypnea at
   presentation. Afebrile but on steroids. Therefore meets SIRS criteria.
   Likely source of sepsis here is fungemia +/- bacteremia. Patient with
   yeast in blood (1 out of 2 cultures) and urine. On [**12-6**] with 1 out of
   2 cultures with coag negative Staph. Also C diff toxin positive at OSH
   within past 1 week.
        Other potential sources of infection include intraabdominal given
   recent surgery, pneumonia, celluliti. Intraabdominal process possible
   given complicated surgical course. Large open surgical wound which was
   debrided within past 3-4 days. On CT abdomen/pelvis, patient with free
   fluid which certain could be infected. Lactate normal (last check
   [**12-4**]). In terms of pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity on chest radiograph
   lilkely hernia but could be consolidation; patient also reported
   productive cough on presentation. In terms of cellulitis, patient with
   skin tears on buttocks and right leg although no evidence of cellultis
   at these sites or surrounding open wound on abdomen.
   - Caspofungin IV started [**12-5**]; awaiting culture sensitivities
        - Need TTE and ophthalmology consult? Will hold at this time as
   reason for consults is to determine duration of anti-fungal course.
   - Vancomycin IV restarted [**12-6**] - will redose this morning based on
   vanco trough (given ?bacteremia)
   - PICC was to be replaced on [**12-6**], but given fungemia and bacteremia
   IV team did not wish to place new PICC. Midline is an option, although
   patient is on Levophed and therefore needs central access. Overnight
   team spoke with HCP and if okay with patient, we may place [**Month/Year (2) 864**] today.
   PICC in place until new access established.
   - Flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for C diff
   - Additional broad spectrum antibiotics (IV zosyn/vanco/Flagyl) as
   potential for abdominal process as well
        - D/c Zosyn at this time as we have source for sepsis. If
   clinically worsens today will considering adding back Zosyn.
   - Patient not interested in having surgery; unable to place arterial
   line on admission
   - 1 pressor (Levophed) + IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>60 (received
   500cc bolus on [**12-6**] with good response)
   - Follow-up blood and wound cultures
   - Trend WBC cound and fever curve
   - Steroids tapered to 25mg IV Q12 hours on [**12-6**]; continue to taper
   - Monitor lactate
   #. POST-OP CARE: Significant pain associated with open wound +
   peritonitis by exam; pain now well-controlled. Seen by surgery on [**12-5**]
   - continue wet and dry dressings. Seen by wound care nurse [**12-6**].
   - Fentanyl patch with morphine prn for breakthrough pain (Fentanyl
   Patch 12 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
   - Wound care nurse: Colostomy care, midline wound care recs
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now 2.5. Not on
   coumadin. Concern for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and
   D-dimer elevated. Nutritional deficiency + having been on antibiotics
   since last admission likely also contributing to coagulopathy. Was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on admission and repeat dose on [**12-6**].
   - Continue to monitor
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic congestive heart failure, and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse with necrosis, and cholecystitis. She was transferred to the ICU with septic shock, likely due to fungemia and bacteremia. She also has pneumonia, C. difficile infection, and a complicated surgical course with an open wound. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, possible intraabdominal infection, pneumonia, cellulitis, and coagulopathy. She requires central access due to Levophed use and has elevated troponins. She has chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, anemia of chronic disease, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction.
2. Fungemia and bacteremia: The patient has yeast in her blood and coag-negative Staph in one of her cultures, indicating a possible ongoing fungal and bacterial infection.
3. Intraabdominal infection: The patient's recent surgical history and the presence of free fluid on the CT abdomen/pelvis suggest the possibility of an intraabdominal infection.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a retrocardiac opacity on chest radiograph, which could indicate pneumonia consolidation.
5. Cellulitis: The patient has skin tears on her buttocks and right leg, although no evidence of cellulitis is seen at these sites or surrounding the open wound on her abdomen.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and there are concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to high output from the colostomy, worsened renal failure, and expansion acidosis.
8. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has oliguria since admission, averaging less than 20 cc/hr despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
9. Elevated troponins: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate myocardial ischemia or injury.
10. Chronic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic congestive heart failure, which can worsen during critical illness.
11. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been in rate-controlled atrial fibrillation and transiently in atrial fibrillation overnight.
12. Anemia of chronic disease: The patient has a baseline hematocrit in the high 20s to low 30s and received packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
13. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has elevated lipid levels, which can complicate critical illness.
14. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TSH and low T3/T4 levels, indicating hypothyroidism.
15. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated baseline creatinine and poor urine output.

The patient's complex medical history and current condition pose multiple potential complications that require careful monitoring and management."

   MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
   Blood culture ([**12-6**]): Pending x2
   C diff toxin ([**12-6**]): Negative
   Blood culture ([**12-4**]): YEAST. STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
   ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY.
   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and
   recent hospitalized for rectal perf, small bowel prolapse with necrosis
   s/p rectocolectomy and perc chole for acalc cholecystitis with course
   c/b pneumonia and c diff. transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] with septic
   shock, now with fungemia and ?bacteremia.
   #. SEPTIC SHOCK: Patient with leukocytosis and tachypnea at
   presentation. Afebrile but on steroids. Therefore meets SIRS criteria.
   Likely source of sepsis here is fungemia +/- bacteremia. Patient with
   yeast in blood (1 out of 2 cultures) and urine. On [**12-6**] with 1 out of
   2 cultures with coag negative Staph. Also C diff toxin positive at OSH
   within past 1 week.
        Other potential sources of infection include intraabdominal given
   recent surgery, pneumonia, celluliti. Intraabdominal process possible
   given complicated surgical course. Large open surgical wound which was
   debrided within past 3-4 days. On CT abdomen/pelvis, patient with free
   fluid which certain could be infected. Lactate normal (last check
   [**12-4**]). In terms of pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity on chest radiograph
   lilkely hernia but could be consolidation; patient also reported
   productive cough on presentation. In terms of cellulitis, patient with
   skin tears on buttocks and right leg although no evidence of cellultis
   at these sites or surrounding open wound on abdomen.
   - Caspofungin IV started [**12-5**]; awaiting culture sensitivities
        - Need TTE and ophthalmology consult?
   - Vancomycin IV restarted [**12-6**] - will redose this morning based on
   vanco trough
   - PICC was to be replaced on [**12-6**], but given fungemia and bacteremia
   IV team did not wish to place new PICC. Midline is an option, although
   patient is on Levophed and therefore needs central access. Overnight
   team spoke with HCP and if okay with patient, we may place [**Month/Year (2) 864**] today.
   PICC in place until new access established.
   - Flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for C diff
   - Additional broad spectrum antibiotics (IV zosyn/vanco/Flagyl) as
   potential for abdominal process as well
   - Patient not interested in having surgery; unable to place arterial
   line on admission
   - 1 pressor (Levophed) + IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>60 (received
   500cc bolus on [**12-6**] with good response)
   - Follow-up blood and wound cultures
   - Trend WBC cound and fever curve
   - Steroids tapered to 25mg IV Q12 hours on [**12-6**]; continue to taper
   - Monitor lactate
   #. POST-OP CARE: Significant pain associated with open wound +
   peritonitis by exam; pain now well-controlled. Seen by surgery on [**12-5**]
   - continue wet and dry dressings. Seen by wound care nurse [**12-6**].
   - Fentanyl patch with morphine prn for breakthrough pain (Fentanyl
   Patch 12 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
   - Wound care nurse: Colostomy care, midline wound care recs
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now 2.5. Not on
   coumadin. Concern for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and
   D-dimer elevated. Nutritional deficiency + having been on antibiotics
   since last admission likely also contributing to coagulopathy. Was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on admission and repeat dose on [**12-6**].
   - Continue to monitor
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get
   arterial gas as she is hypovolemic and clamped down on pressors.
   - Serial venous gases to assess extent of acidosis.
   - Bicarb supplementation in IVF
   #. ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine appears most consistently 1.5-2.0
   although she has had multiple bumps higher than this.  Likely bumped in
   the setting of septic shock. UOP poor since admission, averaging at
   less than 20cc per hour despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Aggressive fluid bolus as large insensible losses
   #. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - ASA held currently given INR so elevated
   - Statin held pending ability to take POs
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above
   # PAF: Appeared to be in rate controlled a. fib in ED. Transiently in
   atrial fibrillation overnight. Not on anticoagulation.
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   # ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE: Baseline hct appears most consistently
   high 20s-low 30s and she is currently within this baseline after
   several liters of crystalloid.  Elevated MCV and high end normal RDW.
   Iron studies in [**2195**] c/w AOCD; B12 and folate were normal at that time.
   Received 1U pRBCs on [**12-6**] with appropriate hematocrit response.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: As not critical at this time will restart
   atorvastatin at current dose once better taking POs.
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased [**12-5**].
   # FEN:
   - Continue to monitor lytes
   - Taking PO liquids
 allow as tolerated
   # Access:  Right PICC
   - Discuss with patient/HCP possibility of placing [**Name (NI) 864**] today.
   - If not interested, will place midline and in turn have to switch
   pressors.
   # PPx:  INR therapeutic.  Reassess as INR falls.
   # Code:  DNR/DNI, no [**Name (NI) 864**]
   - Continue open discussion re: goals of care with family.
   # Dispo:  ICU care
   # Comm:  [**Name (NI) **] is HCP [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1508**] [**Name (NI) 1509**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1510**])

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse with necrosis, and cholecystitis. She was transferred to the ICU on [**2196-12-4] with septic shock. The patient now has fungemia and possible bacteremia, as evidenced by yeast in the blood and coag-negative Staphylococcus in one set of blood cultures. Other potential sources of infection include intraabdominal processes, pneumonia, and cellulitis.

The patient's current medications include caspofungin IV, vancomycin IV, metronidazole IV, piperacillin/tazobactam IV, and levophed. She is also on steroids, which have been tapered to 25mg IV Q12 hours on [**2196-12-6]. The patient's blood cultures from [**2196-12-4] showed yeast and coag-negative Staphylococcus. Her C. diff toxin was negative.

The patient has a history of pneumonia and C. diff infection. She underwent rectocolectomy and percutaneous cholecystitis. She has a large open surgical wound that was debrided within the past 3-4 days. There is also free fluid in the abdomen, which could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, chronic CHF and
   recent hospitalized for rectal perf, small bowel prolapse with necrosis
   s/p rectocolectomy and perc chole for acalc cholecystitis with course
   c/b pneumonia and c diff. transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] with septic
   shock, now with fungemia and ?bacteremia.
   #. SEPTIC SHOCK: Patient with leukocytosis and tachypnea at
   presentation. Afebrile but on steroids. Therefore meets SIRS criteria.
   Likely source of sepsis here is fungemia +/- bacteremia. Patient with
   yeast in blood (1 out of 2 cultures) and urine. On [**12-6**] with 1 out of
   2 cultures with coag negative Staph. Also C diff toxin positive at OSH
   within past 1 week.
        Other potential sources of infection include intraabdominal given
   recent surgery, pneumonia, celluliti. Intraabdominal process possible
   given complicated surgical course. Large open surgical wound which was
   debrided within past 3-4 days. On CT abdomen/pelvis, patient with free
   fluid which certain could be infected. Lactate normal (last check
   [**12-4**]). In terms of pneumonia, retrocardiac opacity on chest radiograph
   lilkely hernia but could be consolidation; patient also reported
   productive cough on presentation. In terms of cellulitis, patient with
   skin tears on buttocks and right leg although no evidence of cellultis
   at these sites or surrounding open wound on abdomen.
   - Caspofungin IV started [**12-5**]; awaiting culture sensitivities
        - Need TTE and ophthalmology consult?
   - Vancomycin IV restarted [**12-6**] - will redose this morning based on
   vanco trough
   - PICC was to be replaced on [**12-6**], but given fungemia and bacteremia
   IV team did not wish to place new PICC. Midline is an option, although
   patient is on Levophed and therefore needs central access. Overnight
   team spoke with HCP and if okay with patient, we may place [**Month/Year (2) 864**] today.
   PICC in place until new access established.
   - Flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for C diff
   - Additional broad spectrum antibiotics (IV zosyn/vanco/Flagyl) as
   potential for abdominal process as well
   - Patient not interested in having surgery; unable to place arterial
   line on admission
   - 1 pressor (Levophed) + IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP>60 (received
   500cc bolus on [**12-6**] with good response)
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Consider obtaining abdominal wound cultures if patient dose not
   improve
   - Trend WBC cound and fever curve
   - Steroids tapered to 25mg IV Q12 hours on [**12-6**]; continue to taper
   - Monitor lactate
   #. POST-OP CARE: Significant pain associated with open wound +
   peritonitis by exam; pain now well-controlled. Seen by surgery on [**12-5**]
   - continue wet and dry dressings. Seen by wound care nurse [**12-6**].
   - Fentanyl patch with morphine prn for breakthrough pain (Fentanyl
   Patch 12 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
   - Wound care nurse: Colostomy care, midline wound care recs
   # COAGULOPATHY: INR elevated to 4.1 on presentation, now 2.5. Not on
   coumadin. Concern for DIC although fibrinogen elevated (although not
   completely reliable given that it is an acute phase reactant). FDP and
   D-dimer elevated. Nutritional deficiency + having been on antibiotics
   since last admission likely also contributing to coagulopathy. Was
   given vitamin K 10mg PO x1 on admission and repeat dose on [**12-6**].
   - Continue to monitor
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Non gap and suspect due to high output from
   colostomy in setting of c. diff, worsened renal failure and expansion
   acidosis given her hyperchloremia.  When corrected for albumin, does
   have AG as well although lactate is normal; no ketonuria. Unable to get
   arterial gas as she is hypovolemic and clamped down on pressors.
   - Serial venous gases to assess extent of acidosis.
   - Bicarb supplementation in IVF
   #. ARF on CRI: Baseline creatinine appears most consistently 1.5-2.0
   although she has had multiple bumps higher than this.  Likely bumped in
   the setting of septic shock. UOP poor since admission, averaging at
   less than 20cc per hour despite considerable fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue supportive care as above with monitoring of UOP - aim for
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Aggressive fluid bolus as large insensible losses
   #. ELEVATED TROPONINS: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - ASA held currently given INR so elevated
   - Statin held pending ability to take POs
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above
   # PAF: Appeared to be in rate controlled a. fib in ED. Transiently in
   atrial fibrillation overnight. Not on anticoagulation.
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   # ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE: Baseline hct appears most consistently
   high 20s-low 30s and she is currently within this baseline after
   several liters of crystalloid.  Elevated MCV and high end normal RDW.
   Iron studies in [**2195**] c/w AOCD; B12 and folate were normal at that time.
   Received 1U pRBCs on [**12-6**] with appropriate hematocrit response.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: As not critical at this time will restart
   atorvastatin at current dose once better taking POs.
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased [**12-5**].
   # FEN:
   - Continue to monitor lytes
   - Taking PO liquids
 allow as tolerated
   # Access:  Right PICC
   - Discuss with patient/HCP possibility of placing [**Name (NI) 864**] today.
   - If not interested, will place midline and in turn have to switch
   pressors.
   # PPx:  INR therapeutic.  Reassess as INR falls.
   # Code:  DNR/DNI, no [**Name (NI) 864**]
   - Continue open discussion re: goals of care with family.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic congestive heart failure, and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse with necrosis, and cholecystitis. She was transferred to the ICU on [**12-4**] with septic shock and is currently diagnosed with fungemia and possible bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, anemia of chronic disease, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH 7.16, PCO2 68, PO2 80, and HCO3 13.7.

The patient's physical examination reveals prominent jugular venous pulsation, herpetic lesions on the lower lip, a regular rapid heart rate, decreased breath sounds bibasilar with a few crackles on the left lower lobe, a midline surgical wound, hypoactive bowel sounds, decreased tenderness compared to the previous day, and pitting edema in the lower extremities bilaterally, as well as considerable edema in the upper extremities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of CAD, chronic CHF, and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse with necrosis, and cholecystitis. She was transferred from another hospital on [**2196-12-4**] with septic shock and now presents with fungemia and possible bacteremia. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including pneumonia, intraabdominal infection, and cellulitis. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains on pressors and requires central access for ongoing care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already in septic shock and requires aggressive management with fluids, pressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. 
2. Fungemia and Possible Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast and coag-negative Staphylococcus. She is already on antifungal therapy, and further sensitivities should be obtained to guide antibiotic therapy.
3. Post-Operative Care: The patient has an open surgical wound and requires ongoing wound care. Pain management is crucial, and she should be monitored for signs of infection or complications related to the surgical site.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and elevated D-dimer levels, indicating a potential coagulopathy. This may be due to DIC"

   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for sepsis secondary to fungemia and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and yeast (presumptively not [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans). Also
   with positive C.diff from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal
   infectious process. Continues to have a leukocytosis to 14.3 and
   hypotensive requiring pressor support.
   - Continue IV vancomycin for Coag negative Staph dosed per daily AM
   levels. Received 750 mg x1 yesterday.  Goal level 15-20.
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage.
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>60
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Continue taper of hydrocort to 25 mg daily
   - Patient will need ophtho consult during admission
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated although trending down to
   1.9 from 2.5 yesterday. Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as
   DIC given elevated fibrinogen and platelets>100.  Likely combination of
   nutritional deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy
   altering gut flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during
   admission.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up Nutrition recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend down,
   this AM to 1.8 with baseline of 1.5-2.0.  UOP continues to be poor.
   ARF likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   - Monitor UOP.
   .
   # Anemia: AM hct of 30 at baseline.  She has an elevated MCV with high
   normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   .
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   .
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry. .
   - Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Hold  ASA and statin
   - Hold BB and ACE-I given hypotension
   .
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Hold BB, ACE-I, Lasix as above
   .
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Hold statin
   .
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased [**12-5**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous hospitalizations for rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse, and percutaneous cholecystectomy. She was transferred to the ICU for sepsis secondary to fungemia and bacteremia.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures for coag-negative Staph and yeast, as well as a previous positive C. diff from OSH. She is hypotensive and requires pressor support. Treatment includes IV vancomycin for coag-negative Staph, PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage, and caspofungin for fungemia.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR but with a trend down to 1.9 from 2.5 yesterday. It is unlikely to be a microangiopathic process such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given the elevated fibrinogen and platelets >100. It is likely a combination of nutritional deficiency and antimicrobial therapy altering gut flora. Vitamin K has been administered.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending down to 1.8 this morning with a baseline of 1.5-2.0. ARF is likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.

4. Anemia: The patient has a high hematocrit (30) at baseline with elevated MCV and high normal RDW. Past iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ACD).

5. Rectocolectomy: The patient's surgical wound needs dressing changes, and she continues to have bloody output from the ostomy bag.

6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF): The patient appears to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter on telemetry.

7. Elevated biomarkers: These are likely secondary to demand ischemia given hypotension. The patient has a history of CAD and previous myocardial infarction.

8. Chronic heart failure: The patient had a previous ejection fraction of >55% without evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is currently on a statin, which should be held.

10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TSH and low T3/T4 levels. Levothyroxine dosage has been increased.

11. Nutrition: The patient is tolerating soft foods well and requires further nutrition consult.

12. Access: The patient has a right internal jugular (RIJ) line, which needs to be pulled back 2 cm.

13. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP prophylaxis.

14. Code status: The patient is DNR/DNI.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1598**] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p
   CABG and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel
   prolapse complicatedy by necrosis now s/p rectocolectomy and
   percutaneous chole with course complicated by pneumonia and C.diff
   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic shock secondary to fungemia
   and bacetermia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and yeast (presumptively not [**Female First Name (un) **]). Also with
   positive C.diff from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal
   infectious process. Continues to have a leukocytosis to 14.3 and
   hypotensive requiring pressor support.
   - Continue IV vancomycin for Coag negative Staph dosed per daily AM
   levels. Received 750 mg x1 yesterday.
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage.
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>65
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Continue taper of hydrocort to 25 daily
   - Patient will need ophtho consult for candidemia
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated although trending down to
   1.9 from 2.5 yesterday. Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as
   DIC given elevated fibrinogen and platelets>100.  Likely combination of
   nutritional deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy
   altering gut flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during
   admission.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up Nutrition recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine continues to trend down,
   this AM to 1.8 with baseline of 1.5-2.0.  UOP continues to be poor at
   XX cc/hr.  ARF likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal
   perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   .
   # Anemia: AM hct of 30 at baseline.  She has an elevated MCV with high
   normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   .
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   .
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry. .
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   .
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Restart ASA and statin
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   .
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous surgeries, including CABG, rectal perforation, small bowel prolapse, and rectocolectomy. She was transferred to the ICU for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia. She is currently on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, coagulopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, elevated biomarkers, chronic CHF, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension and requires pressor support. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and requires ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to positive blood cultures for coag-negative Staph and yeast, as well as ongoing leukocytosis and hypotension requiring pressor support.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and is at risk for bleeding or thrombosis. Vitamin K supplementation has been given, but further monitoring and management of coagulation parameters are necessary.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending down, but she still has poor urine output. ARF is likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse complicated by necrosis now post rectocolectomy and percutaneous cholecystectomy. She was transferred from OSH for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, coagulopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, and elevated biomarkers. She is currently receiving IV vancomycin for coag-negative Staph and yeast (presumptively not C. albicans) infection, caspofungin for fungemia, and metronidazole for C. diff coverage. The patient's fever curve and WBC count are being trended, and she is being weaned off levophed with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.

The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to nutritional deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy altering gut flora. She has received vitamin K supplementation during her admission. Her renal function is being trended, and she has an elevated creatinine level. The patient's anemia is attributed to acute on chronic disease (ACD), and her hct level is being monitored. She is also experiencing pain from her rectocolectomy wound, for which she is receiving fentanyl patch and morphine prn.

The patient's recent blood cultures have shown positive results for coag-negative Staph and yeast, which are suspected to be the cause of her sepsis. Additionally, she has a history of CAD s/p CABG with a myocardial infarction in [**2194**]. She continues to appear to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter on telemetry.

The patient's chronic conditions include chronic heart failure (LVEF>55%), hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She is DNR/DNI and requires ICU level of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1598**] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p
   CABG and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel
   prolapse complicatedy by necrosis now s/p rectocolectomy and
   percutaneous chole with course complicated by pneumonia and C.diff
   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic shock secondary to fungemia
   and bacetermia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  Also with positive C.diff
   from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal infectious process.
   Continues to have a leukocytosis to 13.5 and hypotensive requiring
   pressor support.
   - Continue IV vancomycin for Coag negative Staph dosed per daily AM
   levels. Received 750 mg two days ago with level this AM of XXX.  Plan
   to continue for 14 days from first negative blood culture.
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage.
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.  Will continue for 14 days from
   first negative blood culture.
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>60
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Discontinue hydrocort.
   - Patient will need ophtho consult for candidemia during admission.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated and stable at 2.0 today.
   Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as DIC given elevated
   fibrinogen and platelets>100.  Likely combination of nutritional
   deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy altering gut
   flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during admission.
   - Vitamin K 10 mg SQ x1 as patient may have inadequate gut absorption.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up Nutrition recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine stable this AM at 1.8 with
   baseline of 1.5-2.0.  UOP continues to be poor at 20-30 cc/hr.  ARF
   likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   - Monitor UOP
   - Calculate CVP respiratory variation.
   .
   # Anemia: AM hct of 28.8 at baseline.  She has an elevated MCV with
   high normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   .
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   .
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry. .
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   .
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Hold ASA and statin
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   .
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above
   .
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Hold statin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery. She was recently hospitalized for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse, which resulted in necrosis and required a rectocolectomy. The patient also had a cholecystectomy during the same admission. Her current condition is complicated by pneumonia and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient has been diagnosed with candidemia and coag-negative Staphylococcus sepsis. Blood cultures from December 4th showed positive results for coag-negative Staph and Parapsilosis candida. She is currently receiving IV vancomycin for coag-negative Staph, oral vancomycin and IV Flagyl for C. diff coverage, and caspofungin for fungemia. The duration of these antibiotic treatments will be continued for 14 days from the first negative blood culture.

The patient's INR is elevated and stable at 2.0, indicating a coagulopathy. This is likely due to a combination of nutritional deficiency and antimicrobial therapy altering gut flora. The patient has received vitamin K supplementation to address this issue.

Her renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.8, but she has poor urine output (UOP) at 20-30 cc/hr. Acute renal failure is suspected due to hypotension/sepsis and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1598**] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p
   CABG and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel
   prolapse complicated by necrosis now s/p rectocolectomy and
   percutaneous chole with course complicated by pneumonia and C.diff
   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic shock secondary to fungemia
   and bacteremia.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  Also with positive C.diff
   from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal infectious process.
   Continues to have a leukocytosis to 13.5 and hypotensive requiring
   pressor support.
   - Continue IV vancomycin for Coag negative Staph dosed per daily AM
   levels. Received 750 mg two days ago.  Plan to continue for 14 days
   from first negative blood culture.
   - Follow-up vanco level
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage.
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.  Will continue for 14 days from
   first negative blood culture.
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>60
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Discontinue hydrocort.
   - Patient will need ophtho consult for candidemia during admission.
   - Calculate CVP respiratory variation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated and stable at 2.0 today.
   Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as DIC given elevated
   fibrinogen and platelets>100.  Likely combination of nutritional
   deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy altering gut
   flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during admission.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up Nutrition recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine stable this AM at 1.8 with
   baseline of 1.5-2.0.  UOP continues to be poor at 20-30 cc/hr.  ARF
   likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Anemia: AM hct of 28.8 at baseline.  She has an elevated MCV with
   high normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   .
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   .
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry. .
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   .
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Hold ASA and statin
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   .
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   - Holding BB, ACEI, Lasix as above

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse complicated by necrosis. The patient underwent a rectocolectomy and percutaneous cholecystectomy. She was transferred to the ICU for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, coagulopathy, and chronic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures for coag-negative Staph and Parapsilosis, indicating ongoing infection. She is hypotensive and requires pressor support. The plan is to continue IV vancomycin for coag-negative Staph and caspofungin for fungemia, both for 14 days from the first negative blood culture.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated and stable at 2.0, which is unlikely to be a microangiopathic process such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is more likely due to nutritional deficiency and antimicrobial therapy altering gut flora. Vitamin K has been administered to improve INR.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine is stable at 1.8, within her baseline range of 1"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with sepsis and has developed fungemia. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, low blood pressure, and an irregular heart rhythm. The patient's respiratory support indicates they are not on supplemental oxygen, but their ABG results show hypoxemia. The physical examination reveals poor air movement in the chest, soft abdomen with a dressing and central line insertion, and significant edema in the extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values indicate coagulopathy and organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The hypoxemia and poor air movement in the chest suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular collapse: The low blood pressure and atrial fibrillation indicate potential cardiovascular instability, which may lead to further cardiovascular collapse.

3. Infection: The presence of sepsis and fungemia indicates an ongoing infection that needs to be managed promptly to prevent further complications.

4. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR and elevated D-dimer levels suggest a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

They have been diagnosed with fungemia and are currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Caspofungin, and Vancomycin. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/50-132/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has poor air movement in their chest. They also have edema in their extremities and a history of abdominal infection. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as decreased platelet count and blood glucose levels. The patient's medical history, allergies, and review of systems are unchanged from admission. The patient is receiving multiple medications for pain control, shock, and infection, and is on pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's nutritional and glycemic control needs are being addressed, and they have several lines inserted for medical management. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have been diagnosed with fungemia and are currently receiving multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Caspofungin, and Vancomycin. The patient is on levophed for blood pressure support and morphine sulfate for pain management. Vital signs show a low body temperature, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient has a CVP of 9 mmHg, indicating fluid stability. The patient's weight has increased from 62.5 kg at admission to 101.2 kg currently. Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Imaging studies have been performed regularly to monitor the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's current condition of sepsis suggests a potential ongoing or recurrent infection. This can be caused by the spread of the initial infection or new infections acquired in the ICU.
2. Organ dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney dysfunction, which can be a complication of sepsis. Other organs such as the heart, lungs, and liver may also be affected due to the systemic inflammatory response.
3. Thrombosis: Critically ill patients are at an increased risk of developing"

   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic shock secondary to fungemia
   and bacteremia.
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  Also with positive C.diff
   from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal infectious process.
   Continues to have a leukocytosis to 13.5 and hypotensive requiring
   pressor support. Hydrocortisone d/c
ed [**12-9**].
   - D/c vancomycin IV as patient with only 1 positive blood culture with
   coag negative Staph
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.  Will continue for 14 days from
   first negative blood culture.
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Wean levophed with goal MAP>60
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Patient will need ophtho consult for candidemia during admission.
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated and stable at 2.0 today.
   Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as DIC given elevated
   fibrinogen and platelets>100.  Likely combination of nutritional
   deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy altering gut
   flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during admission.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up nutrition recs
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine stable this AM at 1.5 with
   baseline of 1.5-2.0.  UOP continues to be poor at 20-30 cc/hr.  ARF
   likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   - Monitor UOP
   # Anemia: AM hct of 29.1 at baseline.  She has an elevated MCV with
   high normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry.
   - Holding BB given hypotension currently
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Hold ASA and statin
   - BB and ACEI held given hypotension
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse complicated by necrosis now status post rectocolectomy and percutaneous cholecystectomy, course complicated by pneumonia and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She was transferred from another hospital for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia. The patient continues to have leukocytosis, hypotension requiring pressor support, and positive blood cultures for coag-negative Staphylococcus and Candida parapsilosis. She also has a positive C. diff from the previous week and possible intra-abdominal infectious process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia poses a significant risk for further complications. Monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and organ function is essential.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and may have a combination of nutritional deficiency and altered gut flora due to antimicrobial therapy. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and possible vitamin K supplementation are recommended.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.8, but her baseline is 1.5-2.0. ARF may be due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's AM hct is 28.8, and she has an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with a high-normal red cell distribution width (RDW). Past iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Regular monitoring of hematocrit and transfusion for hct<25 are indicated.
5. Rectocolectomy: The patient continues to have bloody output from the ostomy bag. Wound care management and pain control are crucial.
6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient appears to be in AFib/flutter on telemetry. Rate control and anticoagulation management are necessary.
7. Elevated biomarkers: The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers, likely secondary to demand ischemia given hypotension. Holding beta-blockers, statins, and other cardiac medications may be necessary.
8. Chronic heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF but is not currently in overt CHF. Fluid management will be challenging due to the patient's do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and goal of maintaining stable respiratory function.
9. Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin medication is appropriate.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH is elevated, and T3/T4 levels are low. Levothyroxine dose adjustment is needed.
11. Feeding: The patient is tolerating soft foods, and a nutrition consult is required for repletion as necessary.
12. Access: The patient has a right internal jugular (RIJ) line.
13. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery. She has been hospitalized multiple times, including for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse, which resulted in necrosis and required a rectocolectomy. The patient also underwent percutaneous cholecystectomy and was treated for pneumonia and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She was transferred to the ICU for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia.

The patient continues to be hypotensive and requires pressor support. Her white blood cell count is elevated at 13.5, indicating an ongoing infection. She has positive blood cultures for coag-negative Staphylococcus and Candida parapsilosis. Additionally, she has a positive C. diff test from her previous hospitalization, suggesting an intra-abdominal infectious process.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, caspofungin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, pantoprazole (Protonix), and morphine sulfate. She is receiving IV fluids and has been given blood transfusions.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66-137/43-77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of rectal perforation post ostomy, Clostridium difficile colitis, and shock from fungal sepsis. She was transferred to the ICU with the diagnosis of sepsis and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. She has been receiving continuous infusions of norepinephrine and morphine sulfate. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. She has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, including caspofungin for fungal sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis and remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hypotension despite treatment.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): The patient's condition suggests a potential progression to MODS, as indicated by the presence of organ dysfunction in various systems such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal.
3. Nosocomial Infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay, the patient is at risk for developing nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
4. Complications related to the surgical site: The patient underwent a rectocolectomy, which increases the risk of surgical site infections and"

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1598**] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p
   CABG and recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel
   prolapse complicated by necrosis now s/p rectocolectomy and
   percutaneous chole with course complicated by pneumonia and C.diff
   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic shock secondary to fungemia
   and bacteremia.
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  Also with positive C.diff
   from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal infectious process.
   Continues to have a leukocytosis resolved 9.7 today.  Pt has been
   stable off pressors. Hydrocortisone d/c
ed [**12-9**].
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.  Will continue for 14 days from
   first negative blood culture.
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Maintain MAP > 65
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Patient will need ophtho consult for candidemia during admission.
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated and stable at 2.0 today.
   Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as DIC given elevated
   fibrinogen and platelets>100.  Likely combination of nutritional
   deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy altering gut
   flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during admission.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up nutrition recs
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine inmproved this AM at 1.3
   with baseline of 1.5-2.0.  UOP continues to be poor at 20-30 cc/hr.
   ARF likely due to hypotension/sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   - Monitor UOP
   # Anemia: AM hct of 29.1 at baseline.  She has an elevated MCV with
   high normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry.  Pt was
   started on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control and tolerating.
   - Cont metorprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Hold ASA and statin, can restart when more stable
   - Cont BB
   - ACEI  given h/o hypotension can restart when stablized
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock
   will push fluids as possible although may become difficult balance
   given patient is DNI and goal will be to maintain stable respiratory
   function.
   -  cont BB as above
   -  ACEI, Lasix as above
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Hold statin
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased [**12-5**]
   # FEN: Tolerating softs, nutrition consult, replete as necessary
   # Access: RIJ.
   # PPx: INR elevated, PPI
   # Code:  DNR/DNI

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery, recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse complicated by necrosis, and pneumonia and C. difficile infection. She was transferred to the ICU for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia. The patient is currently stable off pressors, but continues to have leukocytosis and elevated biomarkers. She has multiple comorbidities including coagulopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, rectocolectomy with bloody output from ostomy bag, atrial fibrillation, elevated biomarkers, chronic CHF, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and ongoing infections, which can lead to recurrent sepsis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and prolonged PTT, indicating a bleeding risk.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved but remains elevated, and she has poor urine output, indicating potential worsening renal function.
4. Anemia: The patient has an elevated MCV and high normal RDW, along with low hct, indicating possible anemia.
5. Rectocolectomy complications: The patient continues to have bloody output from the ostomy bag, which may indicate ongoing infectious"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with multiple abdominal surgeries who is experiencing shock due to fungemia. She has been improving on antibiotics with decreasing WBC, fevers, and negative surveillance cultures. She is off pressors and currently has atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45 to 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient has a CVP of 7 mmHg and fluid balance of +608 mL over the past 24 hours. She is receiving several medications, including protonix, caspofungin, vancomycin, metronidazole, lopressor, and fentanyl patch for pain. Her lab results show a WBC count of 26.5, Hct of 31.4, Plt of 381, Cr of 2.3, glucose of 182, and other abnormal values. The patient's assessment includes pain control, shock, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, anemia, post-rectocolectomy wound care, and chronic angina. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, adjusting medications as needed, monitoring for volume overload, and providing lasix for tachypnea. The patient is currently in the ICU."

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and septic shock. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of his condition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 101/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including furosemide, caspofungin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. He has been given 20mg IV lasix with urine output of approximately 570 liters, but no additional dose was given due to decreased blood pressure. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for shortness of breath. The patient's weight has increased from 62.5 kg at admission to 101.2 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,270 mL (526 mL PO, 790 mL IVF, 166 mL TF) and output of 1,020 mL (400 mL urine, 180 mL NG, 170 mL drains), resulting in a balance of 0 mL.

   prolapse complicated by necrosis now s/p rectocolectomy and
   percutaneous chole with course complicated by pneumonia and C.diff
   transferred from OSH on [**12-4**] for septic shock secondary to fungemia
   and bacteremia.
   # Sepsis: Patient with blood cultures from [**12-4**] positive for coag
   negative Staph and [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis.  Also with positive C.diff
   from OSH in prior week and possible intraabdominal infectious process.
   Continues to have a leukocytosis resolved to 10.6 today.  Pt has been
   stable off pressors for 2 days. Hydrocortisone d/c
ed [**12-9**].
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl for C. diff coverage
   - Continue caspofungin for fungemia.  Will continue for 14 days from
   first negative blood culture ([**2196-12-5**]).
   - Follow-up on culture data
   - Maintain MAP > 65
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   -Ophtho consulted today to see pt in setting of fungemia.
   # Coagulopathy: INR continues to be elevated and stable at 2.1 today.
   Unlikely to be microangiopathic process such as DIC given elevated
   fibrinogen and platelets>100 (200 today).  Likely combination of
   nutritional deficiency in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy
   altering gut flora.  Patient has received vitamin K 10 mg x2 during
   admission.
   - Trend coags
   - Follow-up nutrition recs
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine improved this AM at 1.2
   with baseline of ~1.5.  ARF likely due to hypotension/sepsis and
   inadequate renal perfusion.
   - Trend renal function
   - Monitor UOP- will have trial of Lasix today- 20 PO BID. Pt on 20 PO
   daily at home.
   # Anemia: AM hct of 30.7 (~30 at baseline).  She has an elevated MCV
   with high normal RDW. Past iron studies consistent with ACD.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<25
   # Rectocolectomy: Patient evaluated by surgery and wound care.
   Continues to have bloody output from ostomy bag.
   - Dressing changes per wound care
   - Fentaynl patch and morphine prn for breakthrough pain.
   # PAF: Continues to appear to be in afib/flutter on telemetry.  Pt was
   started on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control and tolerating.
   - Cont metorprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Elevated biomarkers: Likely secondary to demand ischemia given
   hypotension. Has history of CAD s/p CABG with MI in [**2194**]. Telemetry and
   EKG with considerable ectopy but no indication of acute ischemia.
   - Hold ASA and statin, can restart when more stable
   - Cont BB
   - hold ACEI  given h/o hypotension. Can restart when stablized
   # CHRONIC CHF: In [**11-22**], LVEF>55% without evidence of diastolic
   dysfunction. Not in overt CHF on CXR on admission. Given septic shock,
   was given fluids initially but now pt has worstening anasarca.
   -  cont BB as above
   -  Will try lasix today at 20 po BID- monitoring BP closely
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Hold statin for now
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH elevated to 23. T3/T4 low.
   - Levothyroxine dose increased [**12-5**]
   # FEN: Tolerating softs, hearth healthy diet, nutrition consult,

","Summary:
Mrs. [Last Name] is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), recent hospitalization for rectal perforation and small bowel prolapse complicated by necrosis now status post rectocolectomy and percutaneous cholecystectomy, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She was transferred from OSH on [12-4] for septic shock secondary to fungemia and bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis due to fungemia and bacteremia, which can lead to further systemic infection and organ dysfunction.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and is at risk for bleeding or clotting disorders. Nutritional deficiency and antimicrobial therapy may contribute to this condition.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level improved but is still elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Adequate renal perfusion should be maintained, and renal function should be closely monitored.
4. Anemia: The patient has an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with high normal red cell distribution width (RDW). Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease (ACD).
5. Rectocolectomy: The patient continues to have bloody output from the ostomy bag, indicating possible complications related to the surgical site.
