   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**] and
   was present for the pertinent portions of the physical examination.   I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  Her cough and dyspnea was improved
   after pericardiocentesis.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  She remains slightly
   tachycardic (90-100s) but has maintained a BP > 100 systolic
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   Over the past 12 hours, she reports marking improvement in her
   breathing and cough, but the cough does persistent after deep
   inspiration.  She has pericardial pain and we will begin indomethocin
   as the preferred NSAIA.  There has been continue serous drainage from
   the pericardial drain and an echocardiogram has shown a small rim of
   anterior fluid (without diastolic collapse of the RV).   We will
   continue the drain in place until the output is < 50 mm per day.
   Hematology-oncology will be consulted today for recommendations.
   The management has been discussed with the patient and family.

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, admitted for management of pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the cath lab and had a drain placed yesterday, which is currently draining to gravity. The physical examination shows an elevated JVP, distant heart sounds, no murmurs or pericardial friction rub, and pedal edema 1+ pitting. The laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The pericardial fluid analysis shows a total protein of 4.6, glucose of 64, LDH of 2085, amylase of 11, albumin of 3.3, WBC of 356, and Hct of 17.0.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of pericardial effusion, monitoring for signs of tamponade, continuing drain until output is less than 50-100 cc/day, and sending pericardial effusion for cytology. The patient also has coronary artery disease risk factors, including hypertension and smoking, with pleuritic chest pain but no history of congestive heart failure. Smoking cessation education is recommended, and lisinopril should be held for now. The patient's asthma is being treated with albuterol NEBs, ipratropium NEBs, and continuing outpatient Singulair.

   # Pericardial effusion: Explains patient's symptoms of DOE, orthopnea,
   pleuritic chest pain and lower extremity edema. On physical exam
   patient has distant heart sounds, increased JVP suggestive of
   tamponade. Tamponade supported by findings of electrical alternans on
   EKG. Patient currently tachycardiac with stable blood pressure and no
   evidence of cardiogenic shock. Unable to measure accurate pulsus
   paradoxus due to frequent coughing, however most likely elevated. ECHO
   demonstrated large pericardial effusion with right ventricular
   diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
   physiology. Differential for pericardial effusion is broad including
   viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune, hypothyroidism however based on
   patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss is very
   concerning for metastatic malignancy. Viral infection possible with
   patient's history of sore throat and chills. Labs do not demonstrate
   renal or liver disease. No prior history of TB. Weight loss makes
   hypothyroidism less likely. No recent rashes or joint pain to suggest
   autoimmune etiology.
   - pericardial drain to be placed in cath lab
   - send effusion for cell counts, total protein, LDH, cytology
   - if effusion does not suggest malignancy investigate other etiologies
   - Avoid anticoagulants
   - For pain control ibuprofen 600 mg TID

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, admitted for management of pericardial effusion. The patient presents with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), and electrical alternans on EKG, all suggestive of cardiac tamponade. An echocardiogram confirmed a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired filling and tamponade physiology.

The differential diagnosis for pericardial effusion includes viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune disorders, hypothyroidism, and metastatic malignancy. Given the patient's history of breast cancer and recent weight loss, metastatic malignancy is a concern. Viral infection is also possible, but the patient's labs do not demonstrate renal or liver disease, and there is no prior history of tuberculosis.

The plan includes placing a pericardial drain, sending the effusion for cell counts, total protein, LDH, and cytology. If the effusion does not suggest malignancy, other etiologies will be investigated. Anticoagulants should be avoided, and ibuprofen will be given for pain control. The patient will be NPO until the drain is placed.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents
   with 1 month history of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea; 1 week history
   of pleuritic chest pain and 1 day history of bilateral lower extremity
   edema.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Explains patient's symptoms of DOE, orthopnea,
   pleuritic chest pain and lower extremity edema. On physical exam
   patient has distant heart sounds, increased JVP suggestive of
   tamponade. Tamponade supported by findings of electrical alternans on
   EKG. Patient currently tachycardiac with stable blood pressure and no
   evidence of cardiogenic shock. Unable to measure accurate pulsus
   paradoxus due to frequent coughing, however most likely elevated. ECHO
   demonstrated large pericardial effusion with right ventricular
   diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
   physiology. Differential for pericardial effusion is broad including
   viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune, hypothyroidism however based on
   patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss is very
   concerning for metastatic malignancy. Viral infection possible with
   patient's history of sore throat and chills. Labs do not demonstrate
   renal or liver disease. No prior history of TB. Weight loss makes
   hypothyroidism less likely. No recent rashes or joint pain to suggest
   autoimmune etiology.
   - pericardial drain to be placed in cath lab
   - send effusion for cell counts, total protein, LDH, cytology
   - if effusion does not suggest malignancy investigate other etiologies
   - Avoid anticoagulants
   - For pain control ibuprofen 600 mg TID
   - NPO until drain placed
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.
   - Smoking cessation education
   - For hypertension continue outpatient lisinopril 20 mg qd
   .
   # PUMP: No history of congestive heart failure. See treatment of
   tamponade above.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam. CXR reports atelectasis vs
   early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
   - Culture sputum
   - Albuterol NEBs
   - Ipratropium NEBs
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Breast Cancer: According to patient she is in remission. However,
   patient has missed multiple appointments and did not follow-up with her
   oncologist. Patient's last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to
   continue Aromasin (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not
   taking and is over due for mammogram. Weight loss and effusion
   unfortunately suggest breast cancer recurrence. Patient's oncologist is
   no longer at [**Hospital1 1**].
   - send pericardial effusion for cytology
   .
   # Depression: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, admitted for the management of pericardial effusion. She presented with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Physical examination revealed distant heart sounds, elevated JVP suggestive of tamponade, and pedal edema 1+ pitting.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the assessment is that the pericardial effusion explains her symptoms. The presence of electrical alternans on EKG supports the diagnosis of tamponade. An echo demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired filling/tamponade physiology.

The differential for pericardial effusion includes viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune disease, hypothyroidism, and metastatic malignancy. However, given the patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss, metastatic malignancy is very concerning. Viral infection is also possible with the patient's history of sore throat and chills.

Labs do not demonstrate renal or liver disease, and there is no prior history of TB. Weight loss makes hypothyroidism less likely, and there are no recent rashes or joint pain to suggest autoimmune etiology.

The plan is to place a pericardial drain in the cath lab, send the effusion for cell counts,"

   COMMENTS:      1. Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of
   pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic pressure
   contours.
   2. Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of right
   atrial and pericardial pressures.
   3. After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial
   pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures
   remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure
   of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign,
   consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a past medical history of breast cancer. She presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, progressive shortness of breath with exertion, significant orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. The patient has been diagnosed with pericardial effusion, which was drained in the cath lab on [**9-12**]. The effusion appears to be exudative, and cytology is pending. The patient has also been diagnosed with pericardial effusive constrictive disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pericardial tamponade: The patient initially had hemodynamic evidence of pericardial tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardium exerts pressure on the heart, impairing its ability to pump effectively.

2. Cardiac catheterization complications: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which carries its own set of risks, including bleeding, infection, arrhythmias, and damage to blood vessels or the heart.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray showed atelectasis versus early pneumonia in the right middle lobe. If left untreated, this could progress to a full-blown pneumonia, leading to respiratory distress and potential sepsis.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been placed on pneumatic compression devices"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema. She has been experiencing progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and wheezing, which did not improve with previous treatment for presumed asthma.

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and drainage of a large pericardial effusion. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging reveals a small pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Hemodynamic evidence of pericardial tamponade was observed during cardiac catheterization, but after removing 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial pressures decreased.

The patient's final diagnosis includes pericardial effusive constrictive disease. The assessment plan involves avoiding anticoagulants, continuing drain placement until output despite low output due to the high risk of recurrent effusion, discontinuing drain tomorrow, and repeating echo tomorrow for evaluation of resolution of effusion following drain removal.

Other notable conditions include suspected breast cancer recurrence, asthma, and potential early pneumonia in the right middle lobe. The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital, and imaging non-urgently is recommended. Cytology pending from the pericardial fluid analysis will help determine the cause of the effusion.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
   was present for the pertinent portions of the physical examination.   I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.  Her cough and dyspnea was improved this
   morning but she reports paroxysms of coughing through the day which are
   improved with neb treatments.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.  The fluid drainage was
   approximately 200 ccs yesterday but has fallen to < 5 cc over the past
   12 hours.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   Over the past 24 hours, her breathing has improved and the amount of
   the fluid removed has diminished substantially to trace amounts.   Her
   chest pain has improved on indomethocin.
   Hematology-oncology has been consulted and we are waiting the results
   of the pericardial fluid cytology.
   The management has been discussed with the patient today and all
   questions have been addressed.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, progressive shortness of breath, and significant orthopnea. The patient also reports chills and sore throat for one month. She was treated with antibiotics at that time but did not show improvement. The patient has a history of asthma but her symptoms did not improve with prednisone and nebs. She has been experiencing weight loss and decrease in oral intake.

The patient was found to have a large pericardial effusion with RV collapse on echocardiogram. Pericardiocentesis was performed and 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid was drained. Right heart catheterization showed persistent elevations of right heart pressures consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology. The patient's breathing has improved, and the amount of fluid removed has diminished substantially. She is currently being managed with indomethacin for pain control.

Further investigations include waiting for the results of pericardial fluid cytology and imaging studies such as a CT torso to evaluate for recurrence of malignancy as a possible etiology of the effusion. The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital, and the patient has missed multiple appointments and is not following up with her oncologist.

Potential medical complications that can arise include recurrent pericardial effusion, tamponade, and possible progression of breast cancer. The patient's"

   47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower
   extremity edema of 1 day duration. One month ago patient began wheezing
   and coughing which was treated with 3 weeks of prednisone and nebs for
   presumed asthma by her pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] symptoms did not improve with
   treatment. Patient also describes progressive shortness of breath with
   exertion (currently can only walk 6 feet) and significant orthopnea
   (sleeps in a chair sitting up) of 1 month duration.  Reports (+) chills
   and sore throat x1month. Rx with 5d Anitbiotics at that time.  Recent
   wt. loss, decrease po intake.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, shortness of breath with exertion, orthopnea, and chills. She has been diagnosed with a pericardial effusion, which was drained in the cath lab and is currently draining to gravity. The patient's coronary risk factors include hypertension and smoking, and she experiences pleuritic chest pain. There is no history of congestive heart failure, but the patient's fluid balance indicates a positive fluid balance of -794 mL over 24 hours. Her rhythm is normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital, and there is suspicion of breast cancer recurrence due to weight loss and effusion. The patient also has a history of asthma, depression/insomnia, and lives in a rooming house with reported stresses at home. She has not followed up with medical care and has multiple missed appointments.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Recurrent pericardial effusion: The patient's effusion was drained but there is a high risk for recurrence. Continuous monitoring and follow-up are necessary to prevent further accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac.
2. Breast cancer recurrence: The patient's weight loss, decrease in oral intake, and presence of a pericardial effusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and adenocarcinoma found in the pericardial fluid cytology. The patient also has a history of asthma, depression/insomnia, and is a smoker with CAD risk factors. She has not been following up with her medical care and has missed multiple appointments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion with adenocarcinoma: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid indicates metastatic breast cancer. This can lead to further complications such as tamponade, which may require urgent intervention.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's distant heart sounds and low blood pressure suggest the possibility of cardiac tamponade due to the pericardial effusion. This can cause decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's coughing and wheezing could indicate respiratory issues such as pneumonia or atelectasis. The recent improvement in wheezing suggests asthma exacerbation, which can be managed with bronchodilators.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema raises the concern for DVT, especially considering her immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic anticoagulation with SC heparin is being administered.
5. Breast cancer recurrence: The patient's weight loss and pericardial effusion suggest potential breast cancer recurrence. Further evaluation with imaging studies, such as a CT scan, is recommended to assess for metastatic disease.
6. Infection: The patient's vital signs show a low-grade fever, and the chest X-ray indicates possible early pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate coverage if necessary.
7. Stress-related issues: The patient reports stress at home and has a history of depression/insomnia. Continuous support and monitoring for any worsening of these conditions are necessary.
8. Medication allergies: The patient has an allergy to iodine-containing medications, which should be considered when selecting further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.
9. Social and support issues: The patient's nonadherence to medical appointments and current living situation raise concerns about her social support system. A social work consult may be beneficial to address these concerns.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information. Further evaluation and assessment by healthcare professionals are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a past medical history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema of one day duration and found to have pericardial effusion. She was previously diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid cytology. The patient underwent pericardial drainage in the cath lab on September 12th and is currently draining to gravity. A pericardial window is planned for tomorrow.

The patient has no history of congestive heart failure but has pleuritic chest pain, which does not support angina or acute coronary syndrome. Her blood pressure is currently normotensive, so lisinopril was discontinued. The patient is also a smoker and has CAD risk factors including hypertension and smoking.

There are no appreciable rales or rhonchi in the lungs, and no pitting edema is observed in the extremities. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating between 5.1 and 7.1 thousand cells/microliter. Hemoglobin levels have been stable around 45.9 g/dL, and platelet count has been ranging from 247 to 303 thousand cells/microliter. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius,"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema and pericardial effusion. The effusion was drained in the cath lab on [**9-12**] and appears to be exudative, with cytology significant for adenocarcinoma. Acid fast stain negative. The patient will likely undergo a pericardial window tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrence of malignancy: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid suggests a possible recurrence of breast cancer. Further evaluation, such as a CT scan, may be needed to confirm this.

2. Cardiac tamponade: The pericardial effusion could lead to cardiac tamponade, a condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its ability to pump effectively. This can cause symptoms such as hypotension, tachycardia, and jugular venous distension.

3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of asthma and smoking increases the risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of respiratory status and early intervention are crucial.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema could indicate the development of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous heparin, are already in place.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Likely metastatic disease to pericardial space.  Plan for pericardial
   window.  OK to pull drain today.  Clinical Care time 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and adenocarcinoma found in the pericardial fluid cytology. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including pericardial effusion, coronary artery disease risk factors (hypertension and smoking), congestive heart failure, rhythm disturbances (NSR with occasional PVCs), asthma, depression/insomnia, and potential breast cancer recurrence.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade, cardiac arrhythmias, exacerbation of asthma, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and further progression of breast cancer.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and cardiac status. The patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the need for a pericardial window. Regular assessments of pain control, respiratory support, and medication adjustments should be made as necessary. Additionally, the patient's oncology consult should be followed up to address the recurrence of breast cancer.

In summary, the patient is at risk for cardiac tamponade, arrhythmias, asthma exacerbation, DVT/PE, and further progression of breast cancer. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to manage these potential complications."

   continue Aromasin (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not
   taking and is over due for mammogram. Weight loss and effusion
   unfortunately suggest breast cancer recurrence. Patient's oncologist is
   no longer at [**Hospital1 1**].   Pt was made aware of the fact that this recent
   episode could represent progression of her disease.  Appreciate
   oncology consult.  Cytology significant for adenocarcinoma as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema and pericardial effusion. She has been found to have adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid. The patient has also shown signs of asthma, with significant wheezing on exam, but has improved since admission. There are concerns about potential pneumonia in the right middle lobe, as well as a history of COPD due to her smoking history. The patient's breast cancer is in remission, but she has missed multiple appointments and is not taking her prescribed medication. There are suspicions of breast cancer recurrence. The patient's current condition includes coughing and wheezing, constipation, and no prior history of congestive heart failure. She is currently on various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and has been receiving infusions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/71 mmHg to 92/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of breast cancer: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid suggests a possible recurrence of the patient's breast cancer. Further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with shortness of breath and cough, along with a diagnosis of pericarditis.
- A pericardial drain was pulled in the afternoon, and a thoracentesis was performed on the right side, with fluid sent for analysis.
- The patient was made NPO post midnight for a planned procedure by Dr. [**Doctor First Name **] on [**9-17**].
- It was decided to proceed with left VATS/pericardial window, with the possibility of talc pleuradesis.
- A family meeting was held, where the patient and family were informed about the diagnosis, the need for oncology follow-up, and involvement of social workers.
- Oncology requested a bone scan, either as an inpatient or outpatient, depending on what is easier. They will set up follow-up with an outpatient oncologist and have added two tumor markers to the labwork.
- The patient complained of constipation.
- Lisinopril was restarted, but at a lower dose than what the patient takes at home.
- The final read on the CT torso revealed several findings, including large nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis, no pulmonary lesions, pericardial drain in place, multiple new scattered sclerotic lesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine compatible with osseous metastases, and a new 5-mm nodular soft tissue in the anterior medi"

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - NPO for procedure today
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer presenting with symptoms such as shortness of breath (SOB), cough, and pericarditis. The patient has undergone various procedures including thoracentesis on the right side, pericardial drain placement, and a planned window procedure today. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate between 94-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/91-146/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and abnormal tumor markers.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including breast cancer, coronary artery disease risk factors (hypertension and smoking), pleuritic chest pain, and asthma. The patient's breast cancer has shown evidence of metastatic spread to the spine and pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of pericarditis and potential metastatic spread to the heart, there is a risk of further cardiac issues such as pericardial effusion or tampon"

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - To CT today, NPO for procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: suspect this is the cause of abd discomfort, slight
   tenderness to palpation.  No BM in last several days.  Will up-titrate
   bowel regimen as needed.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult .

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**].  I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.    My examination today is consistent with the
   documented examination.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  The patient remains weak but her
   appetite is good.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   The cytology has shown adenocarcinoma.  She has undergone right
   thoracentesis and the plan today is to perform a pericardial window
   with left thoracostomy drainage.
   The total time of this visit was 40 minutes with over 50% of the time
   spent on coordination of care and discussions with the patient.

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 3139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**], MD
   on:[**2116-9-17**] 16:35 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and cough. She has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid and evidence of bony metastases. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease risk factors, breast cancer, asthma, depression/insomnia, and constipation.

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis with removal of 500 mL of blood fluid consistent with an exudate, and right heart catheterization showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology. She also had a right thoracentesis and the plan is to perform a pericardial window with left thoracostomy drainage.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The large pericardial effusion can cause compression of the heart, leading to reduced cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Respiratory Complications: The pleural effusion and atelectasis may lead to respiratory distress, pneumonia, or worsening of underlying asthma.
3. Metastatic Spread: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid suggests metastatic spread of the breast cancer, which can continue to progress and involve other organs.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to cancer and chemotherapy"

   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema and pericardial effusion. The patient underwent a window procedure for the effusion, which showed adenocarcinoma. The patient has also had a pleural drain placed due to pleuritic chest pain. The patient's fluid overload has improved since the draining of the effusion. The patient's coronary risk factors include hypertension and smoking, but pleuritic chest pain does not support angina or acute coronary syndrome. Lisinopril has been restarted for hypertension. The patient has been non-compliant with oncology follow-up appointments and is currently not taking Aromasin, an aromatase inhibitor. There is evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion showing adenocarcinoma and evidence of bony metastases to the spine by CT. There is also concern for malignant pleural effusions. An oncology consult is appreciated. The patient's asthma has improved since admission, but there is a concern for early pneumonia in the right middle lobe. COPD is likely given the smoking history and lung volumes on CXR. The patient's depression/insomnia is being managed with trazodone. The patient's constipation regimen has been uptitrated without effect.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer. She presents with bilateral lower extremity edema and is found to have pericardial effusion. The effusion was drained on [9-12], and the fluid showed adenocarcinoma. The patient's pleural drains are still in place per [Doctor First Name]'s recommendations. The patient's fluid overload has improved since the draining of the effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient has evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor, with pleural effusion showing adenocarcinoma. There is concern for malignant pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory complications.

2. Bone metastasis: The patient has evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT. This indicates the spread of breast cancer to the bones, which can cause pain, fractures, and other complications.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a rising potassium level, which may be due to tumor lysis syndrome or other factors. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other serious complications.

4. Respiratory infections: The patient has atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe. Although there is no evidence of infection currently, the patient is at risk for developing respiratory infections, especially with her history of asthma/COPD.

5. Depression/insomnia: The patient is being treated for depression"

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - To CT today, NPO for procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and findings of adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid. She has been non-compliant with oncology follow-up appointments and is not currently taking her aromatase inhibitor medication. There is evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor, including bony metastases to the spine and concern for malignant pleural effusions. She also has a history of coronary artery disease risk factors, asthma, depression/insomnia, constipation, and social issues related to living in a rooming house and stress at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant pleural effusion: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid suggests that the pleural effusion may be malignant. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromise lung function.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral lower extremity edema raises the concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
3. Cardiac tamponade: The pericardial effusion can potentially cause cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its function.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's atelectasis in the right middle lobe may predispose her"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**].  I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.    My examination today is consistent with the
   documented examination.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  The patient remains weak but her
   appetite is good.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   The cytology has shown adenocarcinoma.
   She underwent a pericardial window with talc infiltration of the left
   pleural space.  She now has two chest tubes in place with active
   drainage.  Will continue with CT in place today.   She will remain in
   the CCU until the chest tubes have been removed.
   The total time of this visit was 40 minutes with over 50% of the time
   spent on coordination of care and discussions with the patient.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor. The patient underwent pericardial window and talc pleurodesis yesterday, and currently has two chest tubes in place with active drainage.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Malignant pleural effusion: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid indicates malignant pleural effusion. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and compromise lung function.

2. Cardiac tamponade: The large pericardial effusion with RV collapse suggests a risk of cardiac tamponade. This condition can cause hemodynamic instability and decreased cardiac output.

3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and chemotherapy increases the risk of infections, including pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Hyperkalemia: The rising potassium levels may be due to tumor lysis syndrome or other factors. Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and malignancy increase the risk of developing DVT. This condition can lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.

6. Constipation: The patient's bowel regimen needs to be monitored closely to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: bowel regimen uptitrated yesterday without effect.
   Will continue to to titrate to BM.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: rising k, ? tumor lysis, will re-check K this
   afternoon.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult.  Will f/u with social work today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and was found to have pericardial effusion with adenocarcinoma metastasis to her L-spine. A drain was placed on 9/12, but the output decreased, so it was pulled on 9/17. The patient underwent a window procedure yesterday and has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since admission, with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Fluid overload has improved since draining the effusion, and the chest tube was pulled today. The patient is currently experiencing pain, but it has improved from the previous day. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion with adenocarcinoma metastasis: The presence of a pericardial effusion with adenocarcinoma indicates metastatic spread of the breast cancer. This can lead to cardiac tamponade and compromised cardiac function.
2. Bone metastasis: The patient has evidence of bony metastasis to the spine, which can result in spinal cord compression or pathological fractures.
3. Pleural effusion: The pleural fluid analysis showed adenocarcinoma, suggesting malignant pleural effusion. This can cause respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has rising potassium levels, which could be due to tumor lysis syndrome or other causes"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. She presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and adenocarcinoma with metastasis to her left spine. The patient had a drain placed for the pericardial effusion, which was subsequently removed after the output decreased. She underwent a window procedure yesterday and has been in normal sinus rhythm since admission, with occasional premature ventricular contractions. Fluid overload has improved since the draining of the effusion, and a chest tube was pulled today.

The patient has been non-compliant with oncology follow-up and is not currently taking Aromasin, an aromatase inhibitor prescribed for her breast cancer. Recent imaging revealed metastatic spread of her tumor, with pleural effusion showing adenocarcinoma and evidence of bony metastasis to the spine. Malignant pleural effusions were also noted. An oncology consult has been requested.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease risk factors, including hypertension and smoking. However, pleuritic chest pain does not support angina or acute coronary syndrome. Lisinopril was restarted for hypertension at home dose.

The patient initially presented with significant wheezing on exam, but this has since improved. A chest X-ray indicated atelectasis versus early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and the patient is afebrile."

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: bowel regimen uptitrated yesterday without effect.
   Will continue to to titrate to BM.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: rising k, ? tumor lysis, will re-check K this
   afternoon.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult.  Will f/u with social work
   today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer. She presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and was found to have a pericardial effusion. The effusion was drained on [**9-12**], and the fluid showed adenocarcinoma. The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after the output decreased. The patient underwent a window procedure yesterday and has been in normal sinus rhythm since admission (with occasional premature ventricular contractions). Fluid overload has improved since the draining of the effusion.

The patient has several ongoing conditions and concerns, including coronary artery disease risk factors (hypertension and smoking), pleuritic chest pain without evidence of angina or acute coronary syndrome, breast cancer with metastatic spread to the pleural effusion showing adenocarcinoma and evidence of bony metastasis to the spine by CT, concern for malignant pleural effusion, asthma with improved wheezing, atelectasis versus early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR, depression/insomnia, constipation, hyperkalemia possibly due to tumor lysis, and social issues including stress at home and non-compliance with medical care.

The plan includes continuing pleural drains for 24-48 hours per doctor's recommendations, continuing indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control, restarting lisinopril"
