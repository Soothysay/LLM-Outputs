 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD admitted 59 days earlier for upper GI
   bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for hypothermia and hypotension
   and continuing encephalopathy.
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source.
   - Would get one more set of Troponins and if stable, stop trending
   - CVP monitoring --> [**6-9**] this am, would bolus with 1/2NS, as pt
   becoming hyperNa, to a goal of CVP 12-14
   - Continue Levo and Vasopressin to MAP>60, wean as tolerated starting
   with Levo
   - Blood, Urine, Sputum, Ascitic fluid cultures --> f/u
   - Continue with broad spectrums: Daptomycin for VRE, Cefepime/Cipro for
   GNR, PSA, atypicals
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Treat underlying sepsis
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifaximin
   - No indication for intubation at this time
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while hypotensive.
   - Fluids as above
   - Urine Lytes & sediment --> need to be collected today
   - Urine culture
   - Renal consult today
   # Hypernatremia:  Patient not receiving free water flushes this AM, Na
   otherwise controlled.
   - Continue Tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 50 q4hrs,
   can increase if no response to fluids today as above
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit low at 23, trending down from
   26.  Likely underproduction rather than bleeding.
   - tranfuse for HCt < 21 or dropping.
   - hold nadolol for now
   - guaiac all stools
   - FFP for procedures
   - maintain active T+S
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Give 50g albumin today per Hep recs
   - Monitor daily LFT
   # Coagulopathy: INR 1.9 improved today after receiving 2U FFP and VitK
   yesterday
   - VitK and FFP for procedures
   - Watch for bleeding
   # DM2: Continue Sliding scale, BS's have been increasing and will
   likely need to go up on SSI.
   - Calculate insulin needs through today and convert to long acting.
   FEN: Tube feeds novasource renal, replete electrolytes
   Prophylaxis: Boots, Pantoprazole
   Access: 2 peripherals,  LIJ Triple lumen, art line

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) admitted 59 days earlier for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He is now re-admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy.
- The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, as indicated by hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.
- He has a history of bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis.
- The patient's baseline blood pressures are in the 90s systolic.
- Concern for under-repletion of steroids given weak [Last Name (un)] stim, infection, or worsening hypotension from liver disease.
- Hypotension could also be from a cardiogenic source.
- The patient has altered mental status (encephalopathy), waxing and waning clinical parameters.
- He is experiencing acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine from 0.9 to 2.0 and trending upwards.
- The patient has hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ESLD (inactive), MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) scores rising, coagulopathy, and diabetes mellitus type 2.
- The patient has been started on various treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressin, norepinephrine, stress dose"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. He has a history of upper GI bleeding and was previously hospitalized for bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The patient's current conditions include hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, coagulopathy, sepsis without organ dysfunction, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia. It is important to identify and treat the source of infection promptly.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. Hepatorenal syndrome is a possibility, and further evaluation is needed.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's encephalopathy requires ongoing management. Treating underlying sepsis and continuing lactulose and rifaximin are recommended.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a bleeding risk. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma should be administered for procedures.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's hematocrit is low, suggesting anemia. Underproduction rather than bleeding is likely. Blood transfusion should"

   Urine output remains marginal. Concern about ATN. Need to watch
   potassium closely in this setting. Would consult renal for possible
   dialysis in future. Maintain CVP at 10-12. Will need some free water
   today which can be given via NG tube. Consider albumin with lasix to
   increase urine output which would help with K excretion.
   Continues on vasopressors although dose of levophed is coming down.
   Continue lactulose for presumed hepatic encephalopathy.
   Cioagulopathy somewhat improved, but INR remains high.
   Hct stable. No evidence of active bleeding. Not at transfusion

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with hypothermia, hypotension, cirrhosis, and acute renal failure. The patient had therapeutic paracentesis yesterday, resulting in a marked drop in bladder pressure. However, urine output remains marginal. The patient continues to require vasopressors and has normalized body temperature. Coagulopathy has improved slightly, but the INR remains high. The patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is marginal, and there is a concern about acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of potassium levels is necessary due to the risk of hyperkalemia in this setting. Consultation for possible dialysis may be required.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is being treated with lactulose for presumed hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Coagulopathy: Although coagulopathy has somewhat improved, the INR remains high. Close monitoring of clotting parameters is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction. Cultures remain negative, and no definitive source of infection has been identified. Continued antibiotic therapy is warranted.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient's history of cirrhosis needs to be managed appropriately, including consideration of albumin administration and diuresis"

   bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for hypothermia and hypotension
   and continuing encephalopathy.
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source.
   - Would get one more set of Troponins and if stable, stop trending
   - CVP monitoring --> [**6-9**] this am, would bolus with 1/2NS, as pt
   becoming hyperNa, to a goal of CVP 12-14
   - Continue Levo and Vasopressin to MAP>60, wean as tolerated starting
   with Levo
   - Blood, Urine, Sputum, Ascitic fluid cultures --> f/u
   - Continue with broad spectrums: Daptomycin for VRE, Cefepime/Cipro for
   GNR, PSA, atypicals
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Treat underlying sepsis
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifaximin
   - No indication for intubation at this time
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while hypotensive.
   - Fluids as above
   - Urine Lytes & sediment --> need to be collected today
   - Urine culture
   - Renal consult today
   # Hypernatremia:  Patient not receiving free water flushes this AM, Na
   otherwise controlled.
   - Continue Tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 50 q4hrs,
   can increase if no response to fluids today as above
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit low at 23, trending down from
   26.  Likely underproduction rather than bleeding.
   - tranfuse for HCt < 21 or dropping.
   - hold nadolol for now
   - guaiac all stools
   - FFP for procedures
   - maintain active T+S
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Give 50g albumin today per Hep recs
   - Monitor daily LFT
   # Coagulopathy: INR 1.9 improved today after receiving 2U FFP and VitK
   yesterday
   - VitK and FFP for procedures
   - Watch for bleeding
   # DM2: Continue Sliding scale, BS's have been increasing and will
   likely need to go up on SSI.
   - Calculate insulin needs through today and convert to long acting.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who was admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and has been hospitalized for 59 days.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious source of infection. He has had bacteremia, pneumonia, and a urinary tract infection in the past. Peritonitis is also a possible source of infection. His baseline blood pressures are in the 90s systolic. There is concern for under-repletion of steroids due to infection or worsening hypotension from liver disease. Hypotension could also be from a cardiogenic source.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has encephalopathy, which is waxing and waning. Treatment includes managing underlying sepsis, continuing lactulose and rifaximin, and no indication for intubation at this time.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.0 from a baseline of 0.9 and is trending upwards. Hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal failure, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) while hypotensive are possible causes. Fluid management is important,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - renal: sediment suggestive of ATN. Check lytes to check for
   hepatorenal syndrome.
   - bladder pressure 11.
   - Urine studies show sterile pyuria, moderate eosinophils and urine
   lytes suggesting hepatorenal (very low urine sodium, despite serum
   sodium of 147).  Will need fluid challenges to prove hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   - morning labs show worsening creatinine and hypernatremia.
   -Hct this morning from 24 to 21.1
   -Hepatology: continue antibiotics, rifaximin, lactulose
   - Renal: check urine lytes, give D5W IV (3.2L free water deficit) @ 75

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy. The patient's medical history includes upper GI bleeding, bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, peritonitis, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection without an obvious source. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics but remains hypotensive and leukopenic. Under-repletion of steroids may also contribute to his condition.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine levels, along with low urine sodium and hypernatremia, suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. Fluid challenges are planned to confirm this diagnosis.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 2.0, indicating acute renal failure. The cause could be hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis who has been hospitalized for 50 days. He was transferred to the MICU on Saturday with hypothermia, hot nail beds, and altered mental status. He has been improving somewhat but still has acute renal failure and encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 97/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on multiple medications including vasopressin, cefepime, daptomycin, rifaximin, MVI, SSI, lactulose, thiamine, and pantoprazole.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of crackles at the left base. His physical examination shows trace lower extremity edema, soft and non-tender abdomen, and clonus in the feet with extension.

Lab results show an elevated blood glucose level of 177 mg/dL, low sodium level of 119 mEq/L, high potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L, low albumin level of 2.5 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and elevated total bilirubin level of 3.6 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD (on transplant list) admitted 59 days
   earlier for upper GI bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for
   hypothermia and hypotension and continuing encephalopathy.
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source, but
   cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.
   - Fungal markers, micolytic cultures
   - CXR tomorrow to evaluate for ?infiltrate
   - CVP monitoring --> within goal of [**11-15**] CVP
   - Continue Vasopressin to MAP>60, wean as tolerated
   - Blood, Urine, Sputum, Ascitic fluid cultures --> f/u
   - Continue with broad spectrums: Daptomycin for VRE, Cefepime/Cipro for
   GNR, PSA, atypicals [check CK level weekly due to being on Dapto]
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Treat underlying sepsis
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifaximin
   - No indication for intubation at this time
   - No longer on vanco, but follow vanc level to ensure clearing
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while hypotensive.
   - Fluids as above
   - Discuss possibility of hepatorenal syndrome with renal, consider
   octreotide and midodrine if appropriate
   - No HD today, Renal will reassess tomorrow

   - Continue tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 150 q4hrs
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit dropped today
 no obvious
   source of bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p
   last transfusion on [**10-30**].
   - tranfuse 1 unit pRBC today
   - hold nadolol for now

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently listed for a liver transplant. He is experiencing multiple medical complications including sepsis, hyperglycemia, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, coagulopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): HRS is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of liver disease. In this case, the patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. If left untreated, HRS can progress to end-stage renal disease.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled high blood sugar levels, which increases the risk of further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which can worsen and lead to delirium or coma if not managed appropriately. This can result in difficulty with breathing, swallowing"

He is now readmitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy. The patient has a history of multiple infections including bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis. His baseline blood pressures are in the 90s systolic.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with cirrhosis who has been admitted with septic shock and respiratory failure. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently receiving vasopressin, as well as various medications for his other medical conditions including MIV (likely referring to midodrine), FeSO4 (iron sulfate), lactulose, thiamine, hydrocortisone, protonix, rifaximin, and SSI (likely referring to silver sulfadiazine).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/46 mmHg to 110/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and his bladder pressure is 18 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 4,646 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an intake of 2,169 mL through intravenous fluids and 897 mL through tube feeding. His urine output is 223 mL, and he has had 350 mL of blood products transfused.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, platelet count of 26 K/uL, blood glucose level of 267 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 7.7 g/dL, and a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 2.6. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the left base of the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, trace edema in both lower extremities, and unresponsive neurologic status. The patient's eyes are icteric, and he has altered mental status but does not appear to be in delirium.

The assessment and plan include hyperglycemia, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status (not delirium), coagulopathy, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient continues to require low-dose vasopressin, and there are plans to hold off on empiric antifungal coverage given the patient's improvement. Acute renal failure is also noted, with urine sodium levels less than 10, and discussion with the liver team regarding treatment with octreotide/midodrine is mentioned. The patient's diabetes management and hypernatremia are also addressed in the plan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to septic shock, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), further deterioration in renal function, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulopathy, and potential infections related to the indwelling lines and tubes."

The patient's current condition includes:
- Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has signs of infection such as hypotension, hypothermia, and leukopenia. He also has a history of multiple infections during this hospitalization.
- Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which is indicated by his unresponsiveness to verbal stimuli and spontaneous movement of his head.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 0.9 to 2.0, indicating worsening kidney function. This may be due to hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal failure, or acute tubular necrosis.
- Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, requiring adjustments to his insulin dosage.
- Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.7, indicating a bleeding tendency. He received FFP (fresh frozen plasma) and VitK (vitamin K) to improve his coagulation status.
- Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level, which has improved with tube feeds and free water flushes.

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD (on transplant list) admitted 59 days
   earlier for upper GI bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for
   hypothermia and hypotension and continuing encephalopathy.
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source, but
   cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.
   - Fungal markers, micolytic cultures
   - CXR tomorrow to evaluate for ?infiltrate
   - CVP monitoring --> within goal of [**11-15**] CVP
   - Continue Vasopressin to MAP>60, wean as tolerated
   - Blood, Urine, Sputum, Ascitic fluid cultures --> f/u
   - Continue with broad spectrums: Daptomycin for VRE, Cefepime/Cipro for
   GNR, PSA, atypicals [check CK level weekly due to being on Dapto]
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Treat underlying sepsis
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifaximin
   - No indication for intubation at this time
   - No longer on vanco, but follow vanc level to ensure clearing
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while hypotensive.
   - Fluids as above
   - Discuss possibility of hepatorenal syndrome with renal, consider
   octreotide and midodrine if appropriate
   - No HD today, Renal will reassess tomorrow
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] pressures today
 if high, consider paracentesis
   - Urine lytes reordered, per renal

   # Hypernatremia:
   - Switch from D5W at 75 cc/hour to
 NS @ 100cc/hr for free water
   deficit of >3L
   - Continue tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 150 q4hrs
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit dropped today
 no obvious
   source of bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p
   last transfusion on [**10-30**].
   - tranfuse 1 unit pRBC today
   - hold nadolol for now
   - guaiac stools
   - FFP for procedures
   - maintain active T+S
   - re-check peripheral smear
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Monitor daily LFT
   # DM2: No longer on insulin drip; watch sugars today and then adjust
   glargine and SS as needed.  Hyperglycemia on D5W, will switch to
   for better sugar control.
   - Switch from D5W to 1/2NS
   -Adjust sliding scale as needed
   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.5 improved today after receiving 2U FFP and VitK
   on [**10-30**]
   - VitK and FFP for procedures
   - Watch for bleeding
   - Check daily coags

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) admitted 59 days earlier for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, now readmitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy. The patient has a history of sepsis, bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious source of infection. There is a concern for under-repletion of steroids due to weak adrenal stimulation, infection, or worsening hypotension from liver disease. Hypotension could also be from a cardiogenic source, but cardiac enzymes are stable and not trending.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has encephalopathy, which is waxing and waning with other clinical parameters. This requires treatment of underlying sepsis and continued lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated from 0.9 to 2.0 and trending upwards. It is important to determine whether this is hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal, or acute tubular necrosis while the patient is hypotensive. Fluid management should be continued as per previous orders, and the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome should be discussed with the renal team, considering octreotide and midod"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and has been readmitted for the same reason. He is currently on the transplant list. The patient's condition is complicated by hyperglycemia, hepatorenal syndrome, coagulopathy, and potential sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is at risk for infections such as fungal infection in the urine. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections including bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis. There is a concern for ongoing infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and hepatorenal syndrome may be a contributing factor. Management includes midodrine, octreotide, and albumin administration, as well as planned hemodialysis (HD) for fluid removal and electrolyte correction.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and low fibrinogen levels, indicating a bleeding risk. This necessitates the use of vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for procedures.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled blood sugars and requires adjustment of insulin therapy.
5. Sepsis: Despite the absence of organ dysfunction, the patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and leukopenia suggest possible sepsis. Monitoring of vital signs, cultures, and ongoing assessment for potential sources of infection are necessary.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's encephalopathy requires ongoing evaluation and management, including lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, but there is a concern for underproduction of blood cells. Regular monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation profile is essential.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to optimize the patient's health progress in the ICU."

   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source, but
   cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list, acute renal failure, and encephalopathy. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including dialysis, antibiotics, and medications for hyperglycemia, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, coagulopathy, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This condition occurs due to advanced liver disease and can lead to kidney failure. The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening kidney function.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status indicates ongoing encephalopathy. This can potentially worsen and lead to further cognitive impairment or even coma.
3. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient is still at risk for developing infections, especially considering his compromised immune system due to ESLD and sepsis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulation abnormalities, which can increase the risk of bleeding or clotting complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or further end-organ damage.
6. Septic Shock: Although the patient is currently off pressors, there is still a risk of septic shock recurring if the infection is not adequately controlled.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing delirium/encephalopathy. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 52 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 138/57 mmHg to 143/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, warm skin, and right and left lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment shows the patient to be inattentive, not following simple commands, responding only to verbal stimuli, and not tracking or interacting.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 25 K/uL. Renal function tests show elevated creatinine levels ranging from 2.5 to 3.1 mg/dL. Liver function tests reveal elevated bilir"

   procedures.
   The Fungitell assay does not detect certain fungal species such as the
   genus Cryptococcus, which produces very low levels of ([**12-5**])-B-D-glucan.
   This assay also does not detect the Zygomycetes, such as Absidia,

   patient unable to communicate chest pain but HR in 60
s, SBP 110
   - Repeat EKG today
   - Consider consulting cardiology
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source, but
   cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course of
   Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60
   - Continue Micafungin fungal coverage for yeast in urine, per
   hepatology.  Plan for 3 day course; currently day 2.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg po daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Discontinue Daptomycin for VRE, as no longer necessary
   - Discontinue Cefepime, as no indication of current active infection
   - Continue stress dose steroids, plan to taper tomorrow to half dose
   for 3 days, then taper again.
   - Discontinue Midodrine 15 tid and Octreotide
   - Fungal markers, micolytic cultures pending
   - CVP monitoring --> within goal of [**11-15**] CVP

   - Renal to correct lytes with HD; f/u renal recs
   #. Elevated INR:  Femoral line with slow bleeding, INR elevated.
   - FFP as needed to correct INR
   - Liver will be notified of correction of INR with FFP for purposes of
   MELD score calculation

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. He has a history of upper GI bleeding and is on the transplant list. The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and thrombocytopenia. He also has a fungal infection in the urine and is being treated with micafungin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires continuous monitoring and treatment for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has ST depressions on EKG, which may indicate lateral ischemia. Rising troponin levels suggest myocardial injury, raising concerns for cardiogenic shock. Further evaluation, including repeat EKG and consultation with cardiology, is recommended.
2. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, the patient remains hypotensive and has borderline leukopenia. There is no obvious source of infection, but peritonitis could be a possible source. The patient's baseline blood pressures are in the 90s systolic, and there is concern for under-repletion of steroids. Hypotension could also be due to cardiogenic causes or worsening liver disease.
3. Fungal infection: The positive fungal markers indicate a fungal infection"

   infection. it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic
   procedures.
   The Fungitell assay does not detect certain fungal species such as the
   genus Cryptococcus, which produces very low levels of ([**12-5**])-B-D-glucan.
   This assay also does not detect the Zygomycetes, such as Absidia,

   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD (on transplant list) admitted 59 days
   earlier for upper GI bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for
   hypothermia and hypotension and continuing encephalopathy.
   # ST Depressions:  Concerning for lateral ischemia, rising troponins in
   the setting of renal failure.  Currently  not on ACS medications,
   patient unable to communicate chest pain but HR in 60
s, SBP 110
   - Likely stable demand ischemia in the setting of Hct 22.  Transfuse 2
   units PRBC for goal Hct 28-30.
   - Check PM Hct
   - Repeat EKG daily to ensure patient is not evolving
   - Consider consulting cardiology if EKGs show evolution.  Troponins
   unreliable in setting of renal failure.
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source, but
   cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course of
   Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60.  Continued Cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   prophylactic dose for prior history of SBP.
   - Continue Micafungin fungal coverage for yeast in urine, per
   hepatology.  Today is day [**2-2**].  D/C tomorrow.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg po daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Continue stress dose steroids, plan to taper tomorrow to half dose
   for 3 days, then taper again.
   - Discontinue Midodrine 15 tid and Octreotide
   - Fungal markers, micolytic cultures pending
   - CVP monitoring --> within goal of [**11-15**] CVP
   - f/u Blood cultures --> f/u
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Continue Rifaximin, continue lactulose at decreased dose, as pt with
   volumous stool
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while
   hypotensive.  Was treated with 3 day course of Octreotide, Midodrine,
   Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome treatment (day 3 today).
   - HD planned for today and Monday
   - Recheck K+ early afternoon for K+ repletion in setting of renal
   failure
   - Daily LFTs, albumin, coags per liver
   - Discontinued octreotide and midodrine per liver
   - Renal to correct lytes with HD; f/u renal recs
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit stable
 no obvious source of
   bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p last
   transfusion on [**11-2**].  Hematocrit decreased [**11-6**] in setting of elevated
   INR from liver failure.  R Femoral line also with slow bleeding.
   - 2 units PRBC in setting of likely demand ischemia, as above.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon.
   - Discuss removal of femoral line following dialysis with Renal,
   ensuring another line is placed prior to pulling femoral line
   - maintain active T+S
   - FFP as needed to correct INR if pt actively bleeding
   - Liver was notified of correction of INR with FFP for purposes of MELD
   score calculation
   - hold nadolol for now
   - re-check peripheral smear
   - follow daily cbc, coags, fibrinogen
   # Hypernatremia:  improved
   - Continue tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 300 q4hrs.
   Decrease free water to 200cc q4h given resolution of hypernatremia.
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Completed 3 day course of albumin; hold for now
   - Monitor daily LFT
 stable today
   - treatment for hepatorenal syndrome as above
   # DM2: No longer on insulin drip; watch sugars today and then adjust
   glargine and SS as needed.  Hyperglycemia on D5W, switched to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hypertension, acute renal failure, and end-stage liver disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. No infectious source was identified, so he was treated with antibiotics (dapto, cipro, cef). The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple interventions including serosang fluid from NG, octreotide drip, and fluid removal through hemodialysis. He has allergies to no known drugs and is currently receiving various medications, including daptomycin, micafungin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and octreotide.

24-hour events include the discontinuation of cefepime and dapto, serosang fluid from NG, starting octreotide drip, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfused. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) 37.7°C, current temperature 35.8°C, heart rate (HR) 54 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 132/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98%.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD (on transplant list) admitted 59 days
   earlier for upper GI bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for
   hypothermia and hypotension and continuing encephalopathy
   .
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, infection or worsening hypotension
   from liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source,
   but cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course
   of Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60.  Continued Cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   prophylactic dose for prior history of SBP.
   - Micagfungin recommended by hepatology and questioning of adequate
   doses.  5/5 doses likely given.  Due to low suspicion for fungal
   infection, stopped medication at presumed 5 doses.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg po daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Continue on current stress-dose steroid dose until [**11-10**] and then
   decrease by
 and continue to wean by
 q 3 days.
   - Discontinue Midodrine 15 tid and Octreotide
   - continue to f/u pending cultures and culture as needed for fevers and
   CV decompensation
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   .
   # ST Depressions:  Concerning for lateral ischemia, rising troponins in
   the setting of renal failure.  Currently  not on ACS medications,
   patient unable to communicate chest pain but HR in 60
s, SBP 110
   - Likely stable demand ischemia in the setting of low Hct.  Transfuse 2
   units PRBC for goal Hct 28-30.  This morning was 28; transfuse 1 u
   today
   - Repeat EKG daily to ensure patient is not evolving; -Troponins
   unreliable in setting of renal failure.
   - Consulted cardiology per liver recommendations.  Will follow up their
   note when they leave one.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Continue Rifaximin, continue lactulose at decreased dose, as pt with
   volumous stool
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while
   hypotensive.  Was treated with 3 day course of Octreotide, Midodrine,
   Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome treatment.
   - HD planned for Monday
   - Recheck K+ early afternoon for K+ repletion in setting of renal
   failure
   - Daily LFTs, albumin, coags per liver
   - Discontinued octreotide and midodrine per liver
   - Renal to correct lytes with HD; f/u renal recs
   .
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit stable
 no obvious source of
   bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p last
   transfusion on [**11-2**].  Hematocrit decreased [**11-6**] in setting of elevated
   INR from liver failure.  R Femoral line also with slow bleeding.
   - 1 units PRBC in setting of likely demand ischemia, as above.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon.
   - Discuss removal of femoral line following dialysis with Renal,
   ensuring another line is placed prior to pulling femoral line
   - maintain active T+S
   - FFP as needed to correct INR if pt actively bleeding
   - Liver was notified of correction of INR with FFP for purposes of MELD
   score calculation
   - hold nadolol for now
   - re-check peripheral smear
   - follow daily cbc, coags, fibrinogen
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  improved
   - Continue tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 300 q4hrs.
   Decrease free water to 200cc q4h given resolution of hypernatremia.
   .
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Completed 3 day course of albumin; hold for now
   - Monitor daily LFT

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently on the transplant list.

1. Sepsis: The patient presents with hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection. Possible sources of infection include bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis. The patient's baseline blood pressures are in the 90s systolic. There is concern for under-repletion of steroids due to weak cortisol response, infection, or worsening hypotension from liver disease. Hypotension could also be related to a cardiogenic source, but cardiac enzymes are stable and no longer trending. The patient completed a 7-day course of Daptomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment. Vasopressin has been discontinued, and the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is >60. The patient will continue on Ciprofloxacin prophylactically at a dose of 250mg per day for a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Micafungin was recommended by hepatology but stopped after 5 doses due to low suspicion for fungal infection. Stress-dose steroids will be continued until November 10th and then decreased by 5 mg every 3 days. Octreotide and midodrine will be discontinued. The patient will be monitored for fevers and cardiac decompensation, and cultures will be obtained as needed.

2. ST Depressions: There is concern for lateral ischemia, with rising troponins in the setting of renal failure. The patient is not currently on ACS medications, but the heart rate is in the 60s, and systolic blood pressure is 110. It is likely that the patient has stable demand ischemia in the setting of low hematocrit (Hct). Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) will be transfused to achieve a goal Hct of 28-30. An EKG will be repeated daily to ensure the patient is not evolving. Troponins are unreliable in the setting of renal failure. Cardiology consultation has been requested per liver recommendations, and their note will be followed up when the patient leaves the ICU.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have encephalopathy, with waxing and waning clinical parameters. Rifaximin and lactulose will be continued, with a decreased dose due to the patient's voluminous stool. Hepatology recommendations will be followed up.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has elevated to 2.0 from a baseline of 0.9 and is trending upwards. The cause of renal failure is uncertain"

      URINE CULTURE (Final [**2145-11-1**]):
         YEAST.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
   Assessment and Plan
   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD (on transplant list) admitted 59 days
   earlier for upper GI bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for
   hypothermia and hypotension and continuing encephalopathy
   .
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, infection or worsening hypotension
   from liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source,
   but cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course
   of Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60.  Continued Cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   prophylactic dose for prior history of SBP.
   - Micagfungin recommended by hepatology and questioning of adequate
   doses.  5/5 doses likely given.  Due to low suspicion for fungal
   infection, stopped medication at presumed 5 doses.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg po daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Continue on current stress-dose steroid dose until [**11-10**] and then
   decrease by
 and continue to wean by
 q 3 days.
   - Discontinue Midodrine 15 tid and Octreotide
   - continue to f/u pending cultures and culture as needed for fevers and
   CV decompensation
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   .
   # ST Depressions:  Concerning for lateral ischemia, rising troponins in
   the setting of renal failure.  Currently  not on ACS medications,
   patient unable to communicate chest pain but HR in 60
s, SBP 110
   - Likely stable demand ischemia in the setting of low Hct.  Transfuse 2
   units PRBC for goal Hct 28-30.  This morning was 28; transfuse 1 u
   today
   - Repeat EKG daily to ensure patient is not evolving; -Troponins
   unreliable in setting of renal failure.
   - Consulted cardiology per liver recommendations.  Will follow up their
   note when they leave one.
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Continue Rifaximin, continue lactulose at decreased dose, as pt with
   volumous stool
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while
   hypotensive.  Was treated with 3 day course of Octreotide, Midodrine,
   Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome treatment.
   - HD planned for Monday
   - Recheck K+ early afternoon for K+ repletion in setting of renal
   failure
   - Daily LFTs, albumin, coags per liver
   - Discontinued octreotide and midodrine per liver
   - Renal to correct lytes with HD; f/u renal recs
   .
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit stable
 no obvious source of
   bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p last
   transfusion on [**11-2**].  Hematocrit decreased [**11-6**] in setting of elevated
   INR from liver failure.  R Femoral line also with slow bleeding.
   - Discussed removal of femoral line following dialysis with Renal who
   does not want to touch line until platelets and INR are normalized.
   - maintain active T+S
   - FFP and platelets to be given tomorrow ([**11-8**]) at dialysis
   - re-check peripheral smear
   - follow daily cbc, coags, fibrinogen
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  improved
   - Continue tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 300 q4hrs.
   Decrease free water to 150cc q4h given resolution of hypernatremia.
   .
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Completed 3 day course of albumin; hold for now
   - Monitor daily LFT
 stable today
   - treatment for hepatorenal syndrome as above
   .
   # DM2: No longer on insulin drip; watch sugars today and then adjust
   glargine and SS as needed.  Hyperglycemia on D5W, switched to
 NS for
   better sugar control.
   -Adjust sliding scale as needed
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Believed due to renal failure
   - to be taken into account during HD
   ..
   FEN: Tube feeds novasource renal , replete electrolytes
   Prophylaxis: Boots, Pantoprazole
   Access:  LIJ Triple lumen, art line, femoral line.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is on the transplant list.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection. Given the patient's ESLD and previous infections such as bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis, there is a concern for sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's baseline blood pressures are in the 90s systolic, and there is a concern for under-repletion of steroids due to a weak ACTH stimulation test. This may indicate an inability to mount an appropriate stress response. Additionally, the patient's cardiac enzymes are stable, but there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock secondary to ESLD.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine has increased from 0.9 to 2.0, indicating acute renal failure. The cause could be hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis. The patient has received treatment for hepatorenal syndrome, including octreotide, midodrine, and albumin.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD (on transplant list) admitted 59 days
   earlier for upper GI bleeding now re-readmitted to the ICU for
   hypothermia and hypotension and continuing encephalopathy.
   .
   # ST Depressions:  Concerning for lateral ischemia, rising troponins in
   the setting of renal failure.  Currently  not on ACS medications,
   patient unable to communicate chest pain but HR in 60
s, SBP 110
   - Likely stable demand ischemia in the setting of low Hct.  Transfuse 2
   units PRBC for goal Hct 28-30.  This morning was 28; transfuse 1 u
   today
   - Repeat EKG daily to ensure patient is not evolving
   - Consider consulting cardiology if EKGs show evolution.  Troponins
   unreliable in setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim, infection or worsening hypotension from
   liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source, but
   cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course of
   Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60.  Continued Cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   prophylactic dose for prior history of SBP.
   - Continue Micafungin fungal coverage for yeast in urine, per
   hepatology.  Last day is today.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg po daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Continue stress dose steroids, plan to taper [**11-7**] to half dose for 3
   days, then taper again.
   - Discontinue Midodrine 15 tid and Octreotide
   - Fungal markers, micolytic cultures pending
   - CVP monitoring --> within goal of [**11-15**] CVP
   - f/u Blood cultures --> f/u
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   .
   #. Altered Mental Status: Encephalopathy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] with other
   clinical parameters.
   - Continue Rifaximin, continue lactulose at decreased dose, as pt with
   volumous stool
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while
   hypotensive.  Was treated with 3 day course of Octreotide, Midodrine,
   Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome treatment.
   - HD planned for Monday
   - Recheck K+ early afternoon for K+ repletion in setting of renal
   failure
   - Daily LFTs, albumin, coags per liver
   - Discontinued octreotide and midodrine per liver
   - Renal to correct lytes with HD; f/u renal recs
   .
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit stable
 no obvious source of
   bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p last
   transfusion on [**11-2**].  Hematocrit decreased [**11-6**] in setting of elevated
   INR from liver failure.  R Femoral line also with slow bleeding.
   - 1 units PRBC in setting of likely demand ischemia, as above.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon.
   - Discuss removal of femoral line following dialysis with Renal,
   ensuring another line is placed prior to pulling femoral line
   - maintain active T+S
   - FFP as needed to correct INR if pt actively bleeding
   - Liver was notified of correction of INR with FFP for purposes of MELD
   score calculation
   - hold nadolol for now
   - re-check peripheral smear
   - follow daily cbc, coags, fibrinogen
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  improved
   - Continue tube feeds and free water flushes, currently at 300 q4hrs.
   Decrease free water to 200cc q4h given resolution of hypernatremia.
   .
   # ESLD: Currently listed but inactive, MELDs rising.
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose/Rifaximin
   - Completed 3 day course of albumin; hold for now
   - Monitor daily LFT
 stable today
   - treatment for hepatorenal syndrome as above
   .
   # DM2: No longer on insulin drip; watch sugars today and then adjust
   glargine and SS as needed.  Hyperglycemia on D5W, switched to
 NS for
   better sugar control.
   -Adjust sliding scale as needed
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Believed due to renal failure
   - to be taken into account during HD
   .
   # ?Dropped beats on telemetry
   - replete lytes prn, to be done at HD today, per renal
   - check EKG this morning
   .
   FEN: Tube feeds novasource renal
 STOP tube feeds today, replete
   electrolytes

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypothermia and hypotension. The patient's medical history includes upper GI bleeding, bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and a history of small bowel perforation. He is currently listed for liver transplantation but is inactive on the list.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypothermia and hypotension: The patient is experiencing low body temperature and low blood pressure, which could indicate sepsis or cardiogenic shock. It is important to continue monitoring vital signs and providing appropriate supportive care.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status with encephalopathy. This may be due to hepatic encephalopathy secondary to liver failure. Treatment should include lactulose and rifaximin, and hepatology recommendations should be followed.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. This could be due to hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause, and renal replacement therapy may be required.

4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia with a low hematocrit and thrombocytopenia with a low platelet count. This could be due to under"

   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, infection or worsening hypotension
   from liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source,
   but cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is on the transplant list. The patient has been readmitted to the ICU after being discharged 59 days ago.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection. Possible sources of infection include bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis.
2. Cardiogenic source of hypotension: There is concern for a cardiogenic cause of hypotension, but cardiac enzymes are stable and not trending upward.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. It is unclear whether this is due to hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to underproduction rather than bleeding. There is also slow bleeding from the right femoral line.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is low and stable, with no obvious source of bleeding. The elevated INR from liver failure may contribute to this.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently on the transplant list. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including sepsis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypercalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including hypotension, hypothermia, and leukopenia. There is a concern for an underlying source of infection, such as pneumonia or peritonitis.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to experience encephalopathy, which may be due to liver dysfunction. It is important to monitor his neurological status and continue with appropriate management.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis.
4. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low hematocrit and platelet count, which may be due to bleeding or underproduction. It is necessary to identify the cause and provide appropriate treatment.
5. Hypernatremia"

","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, a fungal infection, hyperglycemia, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status (not delirium), coagulopathy, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have had episodes of hypotension and tachycardia. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by the presence of hepatorenal syndrome and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for coagulopathy. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are not following commands or responding appropriately.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who was admitted 59 days earlier for upper GI bleeding and is now re-admitted to the ICU for hypothermia and hypotension. The patient continues to have encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the progress note include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has extensive parenchymal opacities on the chest X-ray, indicating possible lung involvement. This could lead to skin breakdown and infections.

2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding and is at risk for ongoing bleeding due to liver disease and coagulopathy. This can result in acute anemia.

3. Fungal infection: The patient is on micafungin, suggesting a concern for fungal infection, although it was stopped after five doses due to low suspicion. Fungal infections can occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with ESLD.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. This can be due to stress, liver dysfunction, or inadequate insulin regulation.

5. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and is being treated for hepatorenal syndrome. Hepatorenal syndrome is a type of kidney failure that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy.
- The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and has been readmitted to the ICU.
- He has sepsis without organ dysfunction, with hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including altered mental status, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypercalcemia.
- He is listed for liver transplantation and has rising MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) scores.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/44 mmHg to 122/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, liver function tests, electrolytes, and blood glucose levels.
- The patient's physical examination findings include impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient's medical complications include sepsis, ST depressions, altered mental status, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypercalcemia.
- The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing Ciprofloxacin prophylactically, administering stress-dose steroids, discontinuing Midodrine, and warming with a Bair Hugger as needed.
- The patient's ongoing concerns include the need for further evaluation and management of potential sources of infection, cardiac enzyme trends, ongoing encephalopathy, and monitoring of liver and renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including hypotension, hypothermia, and leukopenia. There is a need for ongoing surveillance and management of potential sources of infection.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has ST depressions on the EKG, which could indicate ischemia. Further evaluation and management of cardiac function are necessary.
3. Altered mental status: The patient continues to have encephalopathy. Close monitoring and management of this condition are required.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. Monitoring and management of renal function, along with appropriate dialysis, are necessary.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia. Identifying and treating the underlying causes of these conditions are essential.

   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, infection or worsening hypotension
   from liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source,
   but cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course
   of Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60.  Continued Cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   prophylactic dose for prior history of SBP.
   - Micagfungin recommended by hepatology.  5/5 doses given.  Due to low
   suspicion for fungal infection, stopped medication at presumed 5
   doses.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg PO daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Continue on current stress-dose steroid dose until [**11-10**] and then
   decrease by

   - continue to f/u pending cultures and culture as needed for fevers and
   CV decompensation
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   .
   # ST Depressions:  Concerning for lateral ischemia, rising troponins in
   the setting of renal failure.  Currently  not on ACS medications,
   patient unable to communicate chest pain but HR in 60

   - Likely stable demand ischemia in the setting of low Hct/sepsis.
   - Transfuse to maintain goal Hct 28-30.
   - Repeat EKG daily to ensure patient is not evolving; Troponins
   unreliable in setting of renal failure.
   - cardiology believes ST changes and CEs are result of sepsis, not
   ACS.  Also cannot medically manage due to liver failure. Nothing to do.

   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while
   hypotensive.  Was treated with 3 day course of Octreotide, Midodrine,
   Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome treatment.

   - Plan for IR to replace fem HD line with IJ HD line today.   Will need
   correction of coags with goal of INR < 2 and Plt > 50. Recheck coags,
   CBC after line replaced.
   - maintain active T+S

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and continuing encephalopathy. He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis. The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), fungal infection, hyperglycemia, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status (not delirium), coagulopathy, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 74 bpm, a blood pressure of 106/44 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, a murmur over the right upper sternal border, rales bilaterally at the bases, a mildly tense abdomen without rebound, and pitting edema to the thighs. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 25 K/uL, a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for"

   .
   #. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia and borderline
   leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection.  During this
   hospitalization he has had bacteremia, pneumonia and a urinary tract
   infection. Peritonitis is also another possible source. His baseline
   blood pressures are 90s systolic. Concern for under-repletion of
   steroids given weak [**Last Name (un) **] stim test, infection or worsening hypotension
   from liver disease.  Hypotension could also be from cardiogenic source,
   but cardiac enzymes stable, no longer trending.  Completed 7 day course
   of Dapto/Cipro/Cefepime for broad coverage empiric treatment.  Off
   vasopressin and achieving goal MAP >60.  Continued Cipro 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
   prophylactic dose for prior history of SBP.  Micagfungin recommended by
   hepatology.  5/5 doses given.  Due to low suspicion for fungal
   infection, stopped medication at presumed 5 doses.
   - Continue Cipro at 250mg PO daily for prophylaxis for history of SBP
   in the past.
   - Wean stress-dose steroid by half dose to 12.5mg daily; Continue on
   current stress-dose steroid dose until [**11-13**] and then decrease by

   - continue to f/u pending cultures and culture as needed for fevers and
   CV decompensation
   - Warming with Bair Hugger as needed
   - Hold nadolol
   .
   #. Acute Renal Failure: Cr elevated to 2.0 from 0.9 baseline and
   trending upwards.  Hepatorenal vs. pre-renal vs. ATN while
   hypotensive.  Was treated with 3 day course of Octreotide, Midodrine,
   Albumin for hepatorenal syndrome treatment.

   #. RLE Edema:  RLE edema greater than edema of LLE.  Though pt at low
   risk for clots given his coagulopathy, will order LE US to r/o
   thrombus.
   .
   # Anemia & Thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit stable
 no obvious source of
   bleeding. Question underproduction rather than bleeding. s/p last
   transfusion on [**11-2**].  Hematocrit decreased [**11-6**] in setting of elevated
   INR from liver failure.  R Femoral line also with slow bleeding.
   - Plan for IR to replace fem HD line with IJ HD line today.   Will need

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) admitted to the ICU for hypothermia, hypotension, and encephalopathy. He has a history of upper GI bleeding and is on the transplant list. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, altered mental status, right lower extremity edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ST depressions, hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypercalcemia, and dialysis catheter complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, hypothermia, and borderline leukopenia without an obvious current source of infection. He has had bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and peritonitis in the past. There is concern for under-repletion of steroids given weak stim test, infection, or worsening hypotension from liver disease.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated from 0.9 to 2.0 and is trending upwards. It is difficult to determine if this is due to hepatorenal syndrome, pre-renal failure, or acute tubular necrosis while the patient is hypotensive.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has encephalopathy, waxing, and waning clinical parameters. This could be related to liver failure or sepsis.
4. Right Lower Extremity (RLE) Edema: The patient has greater RLE edema compared to the left lower extremity (LLE). There is concern for thrombus, and a lower extremity ultrasound will be ordered to rule out this possibility.
5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable hematocrit but with an elevated INR from liver failure. There is concern for underproduction of blood cells rather than bleeding. The patient's femoral line also showed slow bleeding.
6. ST Depressions: The patient has ST depressions on the ECG, which could be concerning for lateral ischemia. Troponins are rising in the setting of renal failure. However, cardiology believes the ST changes are a result of sepsis and not acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
7. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia but has shown improvement. It is important to continue tube feeds and free water flushes to maintain hydration.
8. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's blood sugar levels were elevated, but he is no longer on an insulin drip. He will be monitored, and his glargine and sliding scale insulin will be adjusted as needed.
9. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is elevated, likely due to renal failure. This will be taken into consideration during hemodialysis.
10. Dialysis Catheter Complications: The patient had complications with his dialysis catheter, including bleeding and infection.

Overall, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications requiring careful monitoring and management in the ICU setting."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old gentleman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was readmitted to the ICU for hypothermia and hypotension, along with continuing encephalopathy. He is on the transplant list due to upper GI bleeding. The patient remains encephalopathic but has improved hemodynamics and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for developing pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
2. Anemia, Acute: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage or bleeding. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
3. Fungal Infection: The patient is at risk for developing fungal infections, particularly in immunocompromised states such as ESLD.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or increased risk of infections.
5. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient is at risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure associated with liver disease.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status (not delirium) could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can result in confusion, disorientation, and cognitive dysfunction.
