","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of his lung, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with placement of a double-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT). He experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis overnight but remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit level.

The patient is currently intubated with a double-lumen ETT and is positioned right side dependent. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/55 mmHg to 138/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is 78 kg, which is an increase from his admission weight of 75 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.2 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin level of 13.3 g/dL, and mildly elevated platelet count of 248 K/uL. The remaining laboratory values are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
- The patient presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung.
- The mass appears to be adjacent to the right pulmonary artery, which is concerning for potential complications such as massive hemoptysis or pulmonary embolism.
- The patient was intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base, rhonchi present on the right side, clear ventilated breath sounds on the left side, and no signs of distress.
- Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) on two occasions, slightly low platelet count (Plt), and normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels.
- Imaging studies revealed a right upper lobe mass with no pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's vital signs were relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate ranging from 51-67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/55-138/72 mmHg, respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, presenting with hemoptysis. He was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of his lung, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a low heart rate, low blood pressure, and is slightly tachycardic. His oxygen saturation is within normal range. His fluid balance shows an intake of 3,545 mL and output of 479 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,066 mL. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. His blood glucose level is normal, but other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Imaging studies reveal no pulmonary embolism but show a spiculated lung mass and associated hilar lymphadenopathy in the right upper lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has experienced hemoptysis, and there is concern for potential bleeding complications due to the presence of a mass adjacent to the right pulmonary artery.
2. Infection: Although the patient does not currently exhibit signs of infection, further evaluation is needed to rule out tuberculosis (TB) and other infectious"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, presenting with hemoptysis. He was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of his lung. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis, which was managed with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He is currently intubated with a double lumen ETT.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 126/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab values including creatinine, glucose, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results are also within normal limits.

Radiology images show a spiculated mass in the RUL, adjacent to the right pulmonary artery, raising concerns about malignancy or infection. Further investigations are planned to rule out tuberculosis (TB) and determine the nature of"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of HTN, BPH, presenting with hemoptysis and found to
   have a spiculated mass in RUL.
   # Hemoptysis: Most likely secondary to mass seen on CT chest. The mass
   appears to be adjacent to the right pulmonary artery which is
   concerning.  Bronchoscopy on [**2126-4-30**] with placement of double lumen
   ETT. Episode of submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**], now s/p coil
   embolization of right bronchial artery.  Has remained hemodynamically
   stable but Hct has trended down overnight.
   - Intubated with double lumen ETT
   - q 6h hct
   - Crossmatch for PRBCs.
   - place A-Line, PICC today for improved access
   - position right side dependent
   - Bolus with NS for tachycardia, hypotension
   - F/U IP recs
   - Thoracic surgery to evaluate for possible lobectomy
 F/U thoracic

   # RUL mass: Concerning for malignancy given appearance, could be
   squamous cell given hemoptysis and central location, however pt does
   not have a tobacco history. TB also a concern, however pt denies TB
   risk factors. Infection is also a possibility.
   - Follow up path from BAL and washings
   - Rule out TB with 3 sputum AFBs.
   - Management of bleed as above.
   - F/U final read CTA
   - F/U cytology
   - F.U with thoracic team re: need for urgent lobectomy (if able to
   defer, proceed with tissue diagnosis/staging)
   # Drop in Hct.
   -          CT to r/o RP bleed
   -          US of groin to r/o bleed
   # Leukocytosis and low-grade fever:
   -          Sputum culture from good lung if sample can be obtained
   -          Empiric tx for aspiration PNA if fever > 101
   -          F/U blood cultures
   - Continue Abx for now at planned 8-day course; could shorten if no
   evidence of leukocytosis/fever going forward as sx may have been due to
   aspirated blood
   # Hypotension:
   -          Hold antihypertensives for now given hypotension on propofol
   initially.
   -          Bolus PRN for poor UOP

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of his lung. The mass is adjacent to the right pulmonary artery, which is concerning. He underwent a bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT). He experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis on 04/30, and subsequently underwent coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He has remained hemodynamically stable but his hematocrit (Hct) has trended down overnight. The patient is currently intubated with a double lumen ETT and is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent episode of submassive hemoptysis indicate a potential bleeding complication. The mass in the right upper lobe of the lung, especially its proximity to the right pulmonary artery, raises concern for ongoing or recurrent bleeding. The patient's decreasing Hct further supports this concern.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fever, which may suggest an infection. Sputum culture from a good lung segment, if obtainable, should be done to identify any infectious agents. Empiric antibiotic therapy may be considered if the patient develops a fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He is currently intubated and sedated, but hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit level.

Potential medical complications:

2. Submassive hemoptysis: The patient had an episode of submassive hemoptysis on [2126-4-30], which was managed with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery.
3. Volume overload: The patient has been +2.8 liters since admission, indicating possible volume overload. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and heart failure.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels have been stable, but there is a concern for renal insufficiency due to the use of nephrotoxic medications and potential hypoperfusion from volume overload.

   81M with history of HTN, BPH, presenting with hemoptysis and found to
   have a spiculated mass in RUL.
   # Hemoptysis: Most likely secondary to mass seen on CT chest. The mass
   appears to be adjacent to the right pulmonary artery which is
   concerning.  Bronchoscopy on [**2126-4-30**] with placement of double lumen
   ETT. Episode of submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**], now s/p coil
   embolization of right bronchial artery.  Has remained hemodynamically
   stable and HCT has been stable.
   - Intubated with double lumen ETT.  Will attempt to wean sedation
   today, wean from vent with goal to extubated today.
   - Start Precedex in an attempt to be able to titrate down (and off)
   propofol.
   - Plan for extubation with anesthesia bedside or in OR with IP (with
   plan to reintubate over a catheteter/wire if needed)
       - watch volume status and consider lasix post-extubation
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - Crossmatch for PRBCs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of his lung. The mass is adjacent to the right pulmonary artery, which is concerning. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right bronchial artery after experiencing submassive hemoptysis. He is currently intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube and is being weaned off sedation and mechanical ventilation with the goal of extubation today. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has been hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. His HCT (hematocrit) has been stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent episodes of hemoptysis are concerning, especially given the location of the mass adjacent to the right pulmonary artery. Continued monitoring for any further episodes of bleeding is necessary.
2. Right Upper Lobe Mass: The spiculated mass in the right upper lobe raises concerns for malignancy, such as squamous cell carcinoma. Further evaluation is needed to rule out other possibilities like tuberculosis or infection. Pathology results from bronchoscopy and washings are pending.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be related to the antihypertensive medications. Holding these medications for now"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- The patient presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of the lung.
- The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis, which was treated with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery.
- The patient is currently intubated with a double lumen ETT and is being weaned off sedation and mechanical ventilation with the goal of extubation today.
- The patient's hemodynamic status has remained stable, and the hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stable as well.
- The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fever, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient also has hypotension, which is being managed with fluid boluses and holding antihypertensive medications.
- Further evaluation is needed to determine the nature of the right upper lobe mass, including follow-up pathology from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and washings, ruling out tuberculosis (TB), and cytology.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the current antibiotic regimen will be continued for now"

The plan is to extubate the patient in the presence of an anesthesiologist either at the bedside or in the operating room, with a plan to reintubate over a catheter/wire if necessary.

The patient's medical team is considering a lobectomy for the RUL mass, which is concerning for malignancy given its appearance.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of his lung. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis, which was successfully managed with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery.

The patient has been intubated with a single lumen 8.0 ETT and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a tidal volume of 5 mL/kg of ideal body weight (5/0) to assess readiness for extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of his lung. The mass is adjacent to the right pulmonary artery, which is concerning. The patient had an episode of submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**] and underwent coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He has remained hemodynamically stable since then.

The patient is currently intubated with an 8.0 ETT and is on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a tidal volume of 5 mL/kg to assess readiness for extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/54 mmHg to 157/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His temperature is 37.9°C.

The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fever, which is presumed to be hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Sputum culture from the good lung, if a sample can be obtained, is planned. Blood cultures from the nasogastric tube are also ongoing. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**]. The patient underwent coil embolization of the right bronchial artery and remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (HCT) level.

On [**2126-5-4**], the patient's ETT was exchanged over a catheter, but it was unsuccessful, and the patient required reintubation with a single lumen ETT. The patient was later extubated on the same day.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 72 beats per minute (bpm), a blood pressure of 156/83 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, an oxygen saturation of 96%, and a sinus rhythm.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 11.8 to 10.9 thousand cells/mm³, a hematocrit (HCT"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe. The patient had an episode of submassive hemoptysis, which was treated with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) but experienced unsuccessful exchange of ETT, resulting in reintubation with a single lumen ETT. The patient's Hct has been stable, and he is currently extubated. He is tolerating ice chips and sips, advancing his diet to clears. The patient has guaiac positive stool in the early AM, suggesting possible old blood swallowed with earlier hemoptysis. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient's primary complaint is hemoptysis, which is most likely secondary to the mass seen on CT chest.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload with a Foley catheter output of 500+ mL after Lasix on [**5-3**]. His creatinine levels have been stable, slightly elevated to 1.0 today from 0.8-0.9.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis, which was treated with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He remained hemodynamically stable, and his hematocrit (HCT) level has been stable as well.

The patient's current condition includes invasive ventilation, which was stopped at 11:40 AM. He tolerated ice chips and sips, so his diet was advanced to clears. A guaiac positive stool was noted in the early morning, suggesting old blood possibly swallowed with earlier hemoptysis. The plan is to call interventional pulmonology (IP) for endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in the morning. After obtaining a pathological diagnosis, a consult with radiation oncology will be requested.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 12:30 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 02:15 AM. He is currently receiving other ICU medications and has not experienced any significant changes in his medical and family history.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/49 mmHg to 162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is 78 kg, with a height of 66 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,727 mL, including 374 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's output includes 510 mL of oral intake, 250 mL of stool, and 2,315 mL of urine. The net fluid balance is -588 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen delivery, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, and spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) is 450 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 31 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 124 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 96%. The patient's minute ventilation (Ve) is 9.2 L/min.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. 

The patient experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**] and underwent coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. The patient remained hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit level. On [**5-4**], the patient's endotracheal tube was exchanged over a catheter but was unsuccessful, leading to re-intubation with a single lumen ETT.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 156/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but has been extubated and is tolerating oral intake.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 x 10^9/L, slightly elevated hematocrit levels ranging from 35.6% to 40.3%, and normal platelet count. The creatinine level is stable at 0.8-1.0 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate low phosphate levels"

   appears to be adjacent to the right pulmonary artery which is
   concerning.  Bronchoscopy on [**2126-4-30**] with placement of double lumen
   ETT. Episode of submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**], now s/p coil
   embolization of right bronchial artery.  Has remained hemodynamically
   stable and HCT has been stable.
   - Intubated with single lumen 8.0 ETT.  Will perform SBT with 5/0 with
   goal to extubate today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of his lung. The mass appears to be adjacent to the right pulmonary artery, which is concerning. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis, for which he received coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He has remained hemodynamically stable, and his hematocrit (HCT) has been stable.

The patient is currently intubated with a single lumen 8.0 ETT and is being weaned off ventilatory support. The plan is to extubate him today. He will continue to receive Precedex, a sedative medication, and will have daily HCT monitoring. The patient is also scheduled for a thoracic surgery consultation to evaluate for possible lobectomy. 

The patient has a volume overload of 2.8 liters since admission. His creatinine levels have been stable, and he received lasix 10mg IV once, which resulted in a negative fluid balance. 

There are several concerns regarding the RUL mass. It is concerning for malignancy due to its appearance, and it could be squamous cell carcinoma given the hemoptysis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, presenting with hemoptysis and a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe. The patient had an episode of submassive hemoptysis on 04/30, followed by coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. He was extubated on 05/04. The patient has been stable hemodynamically, with a stable hematocrit. There is a concern for malignancy given the appearance of the right upper lobe mass, possibly squamous cell carcinoma or tuberculosis. The patient does not have a history of tobacco use or TB risk factors. Infection is also a possibility.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of hemoptysis and the presence of a mass in the right upper lobe, there is a risk of further respiratory compromise, such as pneumonia or worsening atelectasis.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient had a recent episode of submassive hemoptysis and may be at risk for future bleeding events.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade fever, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The sputum cultures show sparse GNRs, commensals, and yeast, indicating the presence of possible pathogens.
4. Volume overload: The patient has a history of volume overload, as"

   Micro:
   [**5-1**] sputum GS PMNs, few epis; Cx
 sparse growth commensals, sparse
   yeast; no AFB on smear.
   Imaging: [**5-4**] CXR: The tip of the ET tube is below the thoracic inlet
   and 5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube passes into the stomach and the
   position of the left PICC line is unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   similar with no newly developed areas of
   consolidation or pneumothorax. The mass in the right upper lobe and
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
   is normal. Degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of HTN, BPH, presenting with hemoptysis and found to
   have a spiculated mass in RUL.
   # Hemoptysis: Most likely secondary to mass seen on CT chest.
   Bronchoscopy on [**2126-4-30**] with placement of double lumen ETT. Episode of
   submassive hemoptysis on [**2126-4-30**], now s/p coil embolization of right
   bronchial artery.  Has remained hemodynamically stable and HCT has been
   stable. [**5-3**] ETT exchanged over catheter, unsuccessful, re-intubated
   with laryngoscopy with single lumen ETT. Extubated [**5-4**].
   - Daily HCT
   - T+S for PRBCs.
   - position right side dependent
   - Bolus with NS for tachycardia, hypotension, UOP
   - F/U IP recs
   # Volume Overload
 LOS 500+ after Lasix on [**5-3**].  Creatinine has been
   stable, slightly elevated to 1.0 today from 0.8-0.9.
   - Goal TBB even for today.
   - DC Foley
   # RUL mass: Concerning for malignancy given appearance, could be
   squamous cell given hemoptysis and central location, however pt does
   not have a tobacco history. TB also a concern, however pt denies TB
   risk factors. Infection is also a possibility.
   - Cytology: [**4-30**] RUL bronchial washings: Atypical epithelial cells,
   favor reactive bronchial cells.; [**4-30**] RUL bronchial brushings: negative
   for malignant cells; Reactive bronchial cells and pulmonary
   macrophages.
   - Thoracic surgery consulted for possible lobectomy; no surgical
   intervention at this time and signing off.  Recommend PFTs when
   possible,  PET-CT, brain scan to evaluate for lesions when possible
   (prefer MRI), EBUS for tissue bx vs cervical mediastinoscopy
   - Plan per IP is for EBUS on Tuesday
   - Ruled out TB with 3 negative sputum AFBs.  Sputum x 3 to date has
   head negative smear for AFB, AFB culture pending.
   - Management of bleed as above
   # Leukocytosis and low-grade fever:  DDX infectious, in particular
   post-obstructive pneumonia, versus post-bronch.
   - Sputum cultures: [**4-30**] sparse GNRs, [**4-30**] commensals; [**5-1**] sparse yeast
   - F/U blood cultures (NGTD)
   - d/c antibiotics today (vanc / zosyn day 1 = [**5-1**]) given no patient
   has been persistent afebrile without elevated WBC count
   # Hypotension: Resolved off propofol.
   - Started on home norvasc yesterday, will add back home captopril 25
   tid and increase as needed
   - Bolus PRN for poor UOP
   # BPH:
   - Hold finasteride and alphablocker.
   # FEN: IVFs as above, replete electrolytes, advance diet as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, famotidine
   # Access: PICC line [**5-2**]
   # Code: full
   # Communication: 2 sons [**Name (NI) 11676**].
   # Disposition: to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient presented with hemoptysis and was found to have a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) and experienced an episode of submassive hemoptysis, which was managed with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and the hematocrit (HCT) level has been stable as well.

The patient was extubated on [**2126-5-4**] and tolerated ice chips and sips, advancing the diet to clears. However, the patient had a positive guaiac stool test in the early morning, indicating possible old blood swallowed with earlier hemoptysis. 

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/49 mmHg to 162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 78 kg, with a baseline admission weight of 73.4 kg. The patient has received intravenous fluids and has been repleted with"
