   Disposition:
","The patient is a 41-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with the chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, IV fluids, and respiratory support through an endotracheal tube on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range, but their blood pressure is elevated. The respiratory rate is low and assisted by the ventilator. Oxygen saturation is at 100%. 

The patient has received a total of 1,650 mL of fluids, with 1,410 mL administered through intravenous fluids. Urine output has been low at 85 mL over 24 hours. 

Regarding laboratory results, the patient has elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin levels. Blood glucose levels are also high. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, and liver enzymes are within normal range or slightly elevated. 

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient being unconscious and intubated. 

The patient's medical history and allergies are not mentioned. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and glycemic control issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She was admitted with respiratory failure due to probable aspiration. The patient is intubated and sedated, and her vital signs are stable. She has bilateral AKAs (acute kidney injuries), and her laboratory results show several abnormalities including elevated creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. She is also anemic with a Hct of 26.1%. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, with possible causes including aspiration pneumonitis, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumothorax (PTX), infection/sepsis, medication overdose, or hypoglycemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and sputum culture has been sent. Blood cultures will be followed up, and other infections will be ruled out. The patient's oxygen levels will be weaned, and the mode of ventilation will be changed to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as tolerated. Measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be implemented. 

The patient's DM2 will be managed by holding oral hypoglycemics and starting fixed and sliding scale insulin. Her PVD will be monitored, as the stumps appear clean. Anemia will be investigated further by checking reticulocytes"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if she does not respond to weaning off sedation and continues to require pressure support.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which would require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased circulation due to bed rest can increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subq heparin should be continued.
4. Stress Ulcer: Prolonged use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be continued.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible renal insufficiency. It is important to monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, which needs to be monitored. Trending HCT and rechecking with pm labs is recommended.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds who was admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure. The patient has clear risk factors and evidence of aspiration, which may have led to plugging of the airways and acute changes in oxygenation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 176/61 mmHg to 90/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 334 mg/dL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 49 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L, and elevated lactic acid level of 22.9%. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal range. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds who presented with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure. She has clear risk for and evidence of aspiration event with possible plugging of airways leading to acute changes with rapid improvement in oxygenation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure - The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration, which is evident from her history and rapid improvement in oxygenation after clearing the airways. She needs to be weaned off FiO2 and maintained on PSV with significant pressure to maintain volumes. She is also at risk for non-cardiogenic edema and evolving pneumonitis.

2. Acute Renal Failure - The patient has an elevation in serum creatinine, suggesting acute renal failure. The true baseline needs to be established, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. Renal azotemia and monitoring of creatinine and urine output will be important for renal dose adjustments of medications.

3. Diabetes - The patient has poorly controlled diabetes in the setting of acute illness, and insulin sliding scale will be necessary for glycemic control.

Other ICU care considerations include nutrition through a G-tube, monitoring for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with"

   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. She is being weaned off
   sedation, currently on 25 Fentanyl, off Versed. No relative hypoxia nor
   [**Name (NI) **] gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary
   process causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/46 mmHg to 182/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including sedatives, analgesics, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for her medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.
2. Pressure ulcers: Immobility due to bed rest can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and use of pressure-relieving devices can help prevent this complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin and early ambulation should be implemented.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive lines increase the risk of nosocomial infections,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. No relative hypoxia nor [**Name (NI) **]
   gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary process
   causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for infxn but
   afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather than true
   pneumonia.  Has been weaned off of sedation and is satting well on PSV.
   Has sputum gram stain showing 4+ GPC p/c/c.  Mental status appears to
   be at or near her baseline.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given previous fevers, ? of PNA on xray, and now 4+ GPC p/c/c.
   Will continue until culture data and speciation returns.
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Will try to extubate today, given her hypertension, will treat her
   with hydralazine first, and have Nitroglycerin at the bedside.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds. She was admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure. The patient has evidence of aspiration, and her condition suggests possible plugging of the airways leading to acute changes with rapid improvement in oxygenation.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Acute Respiratory Failure - The patient needs to be weaned off FiO2 on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but requires significant pressure to maintain volumes. She also has non-cardiogenic edema in the setting of evolving pneumonitis. Antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) have been prescribed for possible aspiration event.
2) Acute Renal Failure - The patient has an elevation in serum creatinine, suggesting renal azotemia. Renal dose adjustment of all medications and close monitoring of creatinine and urine output are recommended.
3) Diabetes - Insulin sliding scale will be required due to poorly controlled blood glucose levels in the setting of acute illness.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed.
- Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be monitored and managed with insulin sliding scale.
- Lines: The patient has 18 and 20 gauge lines.
- Prophylaxis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (P"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds. She was admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure. The patient has clear risk for and evidence of aspiration events with possible plugging of airways leading to acute changes in oxygenation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and the differential diagnosis includes aspiration versus nosocomial pneumonia. The presence of 4+ GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in the sputum suggests an infection, and the patient is already on vancomycin but with low trough levels. The plan is to adjust the vancomycin dosage and continue with Zosyn.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is stable, but there is a concern for acute renal failure.
3. Diabetes: The patient will need insulin sliding scale as her blood sugar levels are poorly controlled in the setting of acute illness.

Additionally, the patient requires ICU care, including nutrition management (holding tube feedings), glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention, and communication regarding code status. The patient is critically ill, and close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and hypotension. She has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. Upon admission, she was intubated due to her altered mental status and respiratory distress. She has been receiving various medications including nitroglycerin, metoprolol, lorazepam, hydralazine, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

During the 24-hour period, the patient's blood pressure remained elevated despite medication adjustments. She was given additional doses of hydralazine and started on a nitroglycerin drip. After a large bowel movement, her blood pressure decreased to the 150s. The patient also had a growth of 4+ MRSA in her sputum culture, so vancomycin was changed to 750 Q24.

Vital signs remain stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 183/66 mmHg to 200/73 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 at 40%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, HCO3- of 174 mEq/L, SaO2 of 100%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 435.

Physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses could not be assessed, and neurologic examination is not complete. The patient's labs indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments, which could lead to further complications such as heart failure, stroke, or organ damage.
2. MRSA Infection: The growth of 4+ MRSA in the sputum culture indicates a potential infection. If not appropriately managed, it could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors including sepsis, medication side effects, or underlying neurological conditions. It is essential to monitor and address any changes in her mental status promptly.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,347 mL and output of 1,015 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 332 mL. Close monitoring of fluid administration and output is necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.
5. Worsening Respiratory Status: Although the patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 100% on CPAP/PSV, the presence of MRSA and ongoing respiratory distress may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or mechanical ventilation.

Overall, the patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management to address hypertension, potential MRSA infection, altered mental status, fluid balance, and respiratory status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. No relative hypoxia nor [**Name (NI) **]
   gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary process
   causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for infxn but
   afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather than true
   pneumonia.  Has been weaned off of sedation and is satting well on PSV.
   Has sputum gram stain showing 4+ GPC p/c/c.  Mental status appears to
   be at or near her baseline.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given previous fevers, ? of PNA on xray, and now 4+ GPC p/c/c.
   Will continue until culture data and speciation returns.
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Will try to extubate today, given her hypertension, will treat her
   with hydralazine first, and have Nitroglycerin at the bedside.
   -- Discussed with daughter extubation and plan is to reintubate if
   necessary.
   .
   # DM2
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- fixed and SS insulin, FSQ qid, continue TF diet
   .
   # PVD
   -- stumps appear clean, monitor
   -- not on ASA or plavix, likely [**2-10**] h/o GIB
   .
   # Anemia - unknown baseline. Normocytic. Iron studies c/w anemia of
   chronic disease. Also Guaiac positive. HCT decreased today , may be
   seoncdray to component of hemodilution as well. HCts stable now.
   -- trend HCT
   .
   # Renal Insufficiency - unknown chronicity. Was 0.6 in [**2174**]. Urine
   lytes were c/w prerenal so given bolus x 2 and CXR appeasr slightly
   fluid overloaded on CXR. Cr has been stable here 1.9, 2.0, 1.9.
   -- Given her hypertension, will restart her on her home dose of
   Lisinopril 5mg QD
   -- cont to trend Cr and  renally dose medications
   .
   # HTN - home regimen is ACE-I and BB
   -- restart lisinopril 5mg QD.
   -- Metroprolol change from 150 [**Hospital1 **], to 100 TID to give her better
   coverage during the day
   .
   # Hyponatremia - mild, may be due to prerenal insufficiency given
   elevated creatinine and relartively dry MM, improved later yesterday
   am, normalized at 137, has stayed constant at 138.
   -- trend
   .
   # Seizure disorder
   -- phenobarb level therapeutic, continue home regimen
   -- avoid fluoroquinolones to not lower sz threshold
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) admitted with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of probable aspiration, and her respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonitis versus aspiration pneumonia. She has been weaned off sedation and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with good oxygen saturation. Her sputum gram stain shows 4+ gram-positive cocci (GPC) per high power field, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if she does not improve or if there is an underlying primary process causing ongoing ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
2. Infection/Septic Shock: Given the presence of fever, sputum culture showing GPC, and possible HCAP, the patient is at risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection or septic shock.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal insufficiency, which may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. If not managed appropriately, it may lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a decreased hematocrit (HCT), which may be secondary to chronic"

   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. No relative hypoxia nor [**Name (NI) **]
   gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary process
   causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for infxn but
   afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather than true
   pneumonia.  Has been extubated and satting well on 2L nasal cannula.
   Has sputum gram stain showing 4+ GPC p/c/c and cx has not grown out
   CoAg + Staph, sensitivities pending.  Mental status appears to be at or
   near her baseline, though this needs to be confirmed with her family.

   followup set of LFTs was AST 783 ALT 1611, and today are 2245 / 3656.
   Differential for elevated LFTs would be Viral infection, toxic (e.g.
   acetaminophen), ischemia ([**2-10**] to hyperfusion or thrombosis.  Last

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 924**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care. I would add or emphasize the
   following:  The patient continues to do well following yesterday
   extubation.  She is being treated for a [**Hospital 1684**] healthcare associated
   pneumonia with vancomycin.  She remains unresponsive, quite like what I
   am to believe has been her nursing home baseline.  Her LFTs are now
   elevated and rising, and GI has been consulted.  The differential
   includes
shock
 liver (her BP had been documented to be low), drug
   induced (hydralazine), viral, etc.  We will aim to keep her
   normotensive, stop hydralazine, and we are checking viral serologies.
   Despite her limited level of functioning and prognosis, she remains a
   full code for the present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who was admitted with respiratory failure due to probable aspiration. She had been intubated but was successfully extubated today. She is now on low-dose nitroglycerin and metoprolol for hypertension control, with ongoing monitoring of blood pressure. Her recent lab results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are concerning for potential liver injury or dysfunction. Other notable findings include anemia, renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, and elevated INR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure due to probable aspiration, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient is being treated for HAP with vancomycin, indicating a possible infection.
3. Liver injury or dysfunction: The significant elevation in LFTs suggests potential liver injury or dysfunction, which requires further investigation and management.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient has renal insufficiency, and careful monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.
6. Hyponatremia: Mild hyponatremia was observed, and it should be monitored closely"
