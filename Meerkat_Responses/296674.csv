   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 76 yo with PMH of stroke, diabetes who presents in respiratory
   distress, requiring BIPAP, and LLL pna by CXR.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: presumably from pna, though also has ? history
   of CHF.  CXR does not show significant pulm edema.  Continues to
   require bipap.  PE also in differential given tachycardia and hypoxia
   and subtherapeutic INR.  Leukocytosis, bandemia, and lactate concerning
   for SIRS progressing to sepsis.  Currently not hypotensive but dropped
   from systolic 150s to 104 currently.  Pt is DNR/DNI with no pressors or
   escalation of care per HCP, antibiotics and fluid okay.
   - antibiotics - vanc/zosyn/levo to double cover pseudomonas given
   nursing home patient.
   - heparin ggt for possible PE and for anticoagulation given
   subtherapeutic INR
   - would not likely tolerate CTA and CTA would not likely change
   management, so no CTA for PE for now.
   - aggressive fluid replacement to try to keep MAP > 65, but no pressors
   - no central lines per HCP
   - Continue BIPAP as needed - no intubation
   - prn morphine
   - cont scopolamine and prn levsin
   .
   # afib: on coumadin but subtherapeutic by recent lab draw and in our
   ED.  Recent stroke at [**Hospital1 403**] this month, embolic from afib.  On coumadin
   with subtherapeutic INR at nursing home.  Clinically, this is less
   likely stroke than pna and SIRS, though head imaging could be
   considered if new neurological symptoms arise.  Rate improved to 90s
   with fluid.
   - heparin ggt for anticoagulation
   - hold antihypertensive rate control medications
   - control rate with fluid

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a medical history of stroke, diabetes, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), and several other comorbidities. The patient presents in respiratory distress, requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with BiPAP, and has a left lower lobe pneumonia (LLNa) confirmed by chest X-ray. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure in the 90s, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with set parameters of a tidal volume (Vt) of 304 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 19 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 40.0 K/uL and bandemia, as well as elevated lactate levels. These findings suggest the possibility of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) progressing to sepsis. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, which may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 

The patient has a history of CHF, and although the chest X-ray does not show significant pulmonary edema, there is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the tachycardia and hypoxia. The patient's D-dimer levels are elevated, further supporting this suspicion. 

Given the patient's medical history and current presentation, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include worsening respiratory distress and the need for intubation, development of septic shock, progression to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and PE. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation, administer appropriate antibiotics, manage fluid balance, control the heart rate, and consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a medical history of stroke, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothyroidism, psychosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). She presented in respiratory distress and required non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/69 to 86/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is being treated with various medications and infusions, including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, famotidine, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of diffuse rhonchi on physical examination suggest a possible pulmonary infection. Cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's tachycardia and hypoxia raise the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. Heparin therapy has been initiated for possible PE and anticoagulation due to a subtherapeutic INR.
3. Sepsis: The patient initially showed signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) progressing to sepsis, indicated by leukocytosis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of stroke, diabetes, and aphasia. She presents in respiratory distress, fever, leukocytosis, and has a chest X-ray showing left lower lobe infiltrate requiring non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP). The patient has do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status with limitations of treatment, meaning no pressors, no cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), okay to give fluids, and no escalation of care per healthcare proxy.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient likely has left lower lobe pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. There is a risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient requires ongoing BiPAP support and should be closely monitored for worsening respiratory status.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient is on warfarin for anticoagulation, her INR is low. However, she is now being therapeutically anticoagulated with IV heparin. PE should still be considered in the differential diagnosis, and further evaluation may be necessary.

3. Sepsis: The patient exhibits leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), low-grade fever, and thrombocytosis despite antibiotic therapy. These signs suggest ongoing infection and possible sepsis. Empirical treatment"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of stroke, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. He presented in respiratory distress requiring non-invasive ventilation, and was found to have left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, but the chest X-ray does not show significant pulmonary edema. He continues to require bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support.

Initial laboratory results showed leukocytosis, bandemia, and lactate, which were concerning for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) progressing to sepsis. However, these parameters have subsequently improved. Cultures are negative for most organisms except for a negative flu and urine Legionella.

The patient has been started on antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. His goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is set at 65. No central lines are planned due to the healthcare power of attorney (HCP) preference. The patient will continue on BiPAP as needed, without intubation. Morphine is given as needed for pain. Scopolamine and levsin are continued for nausea and bowel movements, respectively.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on coumadin with a subtherapeutic INR at the nursing home. He had a recent stroke this month, which"
