 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
   79F with hypertension and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for
   workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, now transferred
   to MICU for diuresis and further management under monitored setting.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension and RV failure: Differential includes Type I
   PAH (primary process, though would not expect at this age; related to
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**] or possibly portopulmonary hypertension given abdominal
   findings, scleroderma or other rheumatologic disorder given Raynaud's,
   HIV also a consideration), and Type III PH due to chronic
   thromboembolic disease.  PH due to LV dysfunction not supported by echo
   findings; does not appear to have significant primary lung parenchymal
   disease to explain hypertension.  No known history of L->R shunting and
   would be old to present as such now.  OSA alone very unlikely to cause
   this degree of PA HTN.  V/Q scan unlikely to be helpful with effusions
   and difficulty breathing.
   - f/u final report of PA cath hemodynamics.
   - f/u HIV, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, anticentromere Ab.
   - Liver eval as below.
   - Hold home CCB.
   - Diuresis: Goal today negative 1L, will likely need -100ccs/hr ( Put
   out 140 ccs to 40mg, then 40ccs/hr to 5mg/hr ).  We can titrate to a
   drop in her CI.  If she stops making urine, can consider starting
   dobutamine for support.
   - Vasodilators: consider start of epoprostenol +/- dobutamine if still
   with borderline O2 sats with diuresis.
   - Would benefit from coumadin in long term but risks outweigh risks
   presentally given ? varices.
   .
   # Hypoxemia. Requiring non-rebreather to maintain O2 sats.  Treated for
   CAP without improvement, Receiving levofloxacin 750 mg QOD (with
   current GFR), completed course yesterday.  Also appears to have some
   pulmonary edema which may be due to RV overload stressing LV and
   cardiac output.  Could consider ASD with now R->L shunting, age not
   fitting.
   - Diurese now with lasix gtt; consider vasodilators and inotropes.
   - O2 to maintain sats > 92% as PA HTN may be worsened in setting of
   hypoxic vasoconstriction.
   - Patient DNI.
   - No further antibiotics planned.

   # ?Portal hypertension.  Evidence is primarily from a lung CT which
   showed ascites, splenomegaly and possible ascites.  Unclear how much of
   this can be explained by underlying process. Ascites could be explained
   by R heart failure, but unclear if splenomegaly would also be seen
   (though splenomegaly likely could be explained by chronic [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**]).  If
   cirrhosis present, may explain pulmonary hypertension as well.  INR
   elevated to 1.5 at admission without explanation.  Albumin 3.6 (though
   2.9 on admission).  Transaminases normal and iron level normal
   (hemochromatosis unlikely).
   - Dedicated abdominal ultrasound.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea.
- She has a history of hypertension and polycythemia and was transferred to the ICU for management of pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure.
- The patient is currently on diuresis with Lasix gtt, and vasodilators and inotropes are being considered.
- She is also being treated for hypoxemia, which requires the use of a non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
- The patient has portal hypertension, possibly due to cirrhosis, and her INR is elevated at 1.5.
- She has acute on chronic renal failure with worsening creatinine levels and proteinuria.
- The patient has polycythemia and is on hydroxyurea treatment.
- She has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN) - The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, which is a condition characterized by increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. If left untreated, it can lead to right ventricular failure and potentially fatal complications.
2. Right Ventricular Failure - The patient's right ventricle is failing to pump blood effectively, leading to decreased cardiac output and inadequate oxygenation of tissues. This condition can worsen over time without appropriate treatment.
3. Hypoxemia -"

   I would also add that as a trans-atrial or trans-ventricular defect
   could explain her symptoms, we will order a repeat ECHO, this time with
   a bubble study.  We will give Vitamin K and assess for improvement in
   INR, as this could give us an idea of the degree of her liver

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia. She was admitted to the ICU for pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure. She has been diagnosed with hypoxemia and requires non-rebreather to maintain O2 sats. She has also shown evidence of pulmonary edema, which may be due to right ventricular overload stressing the left ventricle and cardiac output. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and is currently receiving diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropes. Other conditions that need to be considered include portal hypertension, acute on chronic renal failure, and polycythemia. The patient's medical history, lab results, and physical examination findings are consistent with these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure: The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and hypoxemia, along with the presence of right ventricular overload, suggest a potential complication of pulmonary hypertension leading to right ventricular failure. This can result in decreased cardiac output and further deterioration of the patient's condition.

2. Portal hypertension: The patient's symptoms of ascites and splenomegaly, along with elevated liver enzymes and prolonged INR, suggest the possibility of portal hypertension. This condition can lead to complications such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepato-renal syndrome.

   workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, now transferred
   to MICU for diuresis and further management under monitored setting.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension and RV failure.  Newly diagnosed, and seems to
   have been having symptoms only x 1 month, though RV dilation and
   hypertropy suggest longer chronicity.  Differential includes PAH
   (primary process, though would not expect at this age; related to
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**] or possibly portopulmonary hypertension given abdominal
   findings, scleroderma or other rheumatologic disorder given Raynaud's,
   HIV also a consideration), and PH due to chronic thromboembolic
   disease.  PH due to LV dysfunction not supported by echo findings; does
   not appear to have significant primary lung parenchymal disease to
   explain hypertension.  No known history of L->R shunting and would be
   old to present as such now.  OSA alone very unlikely to cause this
   degree of PA HTN.
   - Await official report of PA cath hemodynamics.
   - Check HIV.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, anticentromere Ab.
   - Liver eval as below.
   - Check V/Q for eval of chronic thromboembolic disease.
   - Hold home CCB.
   - Diuresis: did not put out to 20 IV; will give 40 IV x1 and then start
   lasix gtt.
   - Vasodilators: consider start of epoprostenol +/- dobutamine if still
   with borderline O2 sats with diuresis.
   - Would benefit from coumadin in long term if no evidence of bleeding
   (care given ?portal hypertension and liver dysfunction).
   .
   # Hypoxemia.  Likely explained by VQ mismatch in setting of severe
   pulmonary hypertension; also has bilateral effusions and atelectasis
   likely contributing.  Was treated for CAP though not much evidence of
   this on imaging.  Also appears to have some pulmonary edema which may
   be due to RV overload stressing LV and cardiac output.  Could consider
   ASD with now R->L shunting, age not fitting.
   - Pulmonary hypertension workup as above.
   - Diurese now with lasix gtt; consider vasodilators and inotropes.
   - O2 to maintain sats > 92% as PA HTN may be worsened in setting of
   hypoxic vasoconstriction.
   - Patient DNI.
   .
   # CAP.  Received levofloxacin 750 mg QOD (with current GFR), completed
   course today.  No consolidation on today's imaging.
   - No further antibiotics planned.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: baseline reportedly ~1.0, has been in
   the 1.2-1.5 range here and at OSH.  Mild proteinuria and abnormal
   microscopy with RBCs and WBCs. Did receive contrast at OSH (though
   elevation present prior to scan).  Acute change differential includes
   hypoperfusion from heart failure, ATN from a number of sources (which
   was thought to be the case at OSH).  Relatively stable since admission.
   - Obtain baseline numbers (?baseline proteinuria).
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - follow UOP
   - consider renal input.
   .
   # Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: patient was seen by OSH hematologist who
   recommended that hydroxyurea be restarted at 500 mg QD; if Hct contiune
   to rise on QD dosing recommend increase to [**Hospital1 **].
   - cont ASA 81 mg
   - continue hydroxyurea for now

   # HTN. At baseline takes nifedipine 30 mg CR and toprol XL 50 mg.
   - holding nifedepine and metoprolol.
   - Diuresing with care as above.
   .
   # ?Portal hypertension.  Evidence on CT chest.  Has ascites and
   splenomegaly with ?varices.  Ascites could be explained by R heart
   failure, but unclear if splenomegaly would also be seen (though
   splenomegaly likely could be explained by chronic [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**]).  If
   cirrhosis present, may explain pulmonary hypertension as well.  INR
   elevated to 1.5 at admission without explanation.  Albumin 3.6 (though
   2.9 on admission).  Transaminases normal.
   - Dedicated abdominal ultrasound.
   - Fe studies, hep serologies.
   - Consider formal liver involvement pending above findings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) and right ventricular (RV) failure. The differential diagnosis includes primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), portopulmonary hypertension, scleroderma or other rheumatologic disorders, and chronic thromboembolic disease. She also has hypoxemia, bilateral effusions, and atelectasis contributing to her respiratory status. She has a history of hypertension and polycythemia, for which she was started on hydroxyurea. She is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 1.0-1.5 and mild proteinuria. She has evidence of portal hypertension, including ascites and splenomegaly. Her current medications include furosemide (Lasix) and she is holding her home calcium channel blocker.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension puts her at risk for further worsening of her condition. It can lead to right heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
2. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient's RV failure can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may worsen due to V/Q mismatch, pulmonary edema, or atelectasis. This can result in"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
 PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
   79F with hypertension and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for
   workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, now transferred
   to MICU for diuresis and further management under monitored setting.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension and RV failure: Differential includes PAH
   (primary process, though would not expect at this age; related to
   [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**] or possibly portopulmonary hypertension given abdominal
   findings, scleroderma or other rheumatologic disorder given Raynaud's,
   HIV also a consideration), and PH due to chronic thromboembolic
   disease.  PH due to LV dysfunction not supported by echo findings; does
   not appear to have significant primary lung parenchymal disease to
   explain hypertension.  No known history of L->R shunting and would be
   old to present as such now.  OSA alone very unlikely to cause this
   degree of PA HTN.
   - Await official report of PA cath hemodynamics.
   - Check HIV.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, anticentromere Ab.
   - Liver eval as below.
   - Check V/Q for eval of chronic thromboembolic disease.
   - Hold home CCB.
   - Diuresis: Goal today negative 1L, will likely need -100ccs/hr ( Put
   out 140 ccs to 40mg, then 40ccs/hr to 5mg/hr ).
   - Vasodilators: consider start of epoprostenol +/- dobutamine if still
   with borderline O2 sats with diuresis.
   - Would benefit from coumadin in long term if no evidence of bleeding
   (care given ?portal hypertension and liver dysfunction).
   .
   # Hypoxemia.  Likely explained by VQ mismatch in setting of severe
   pulmonary hypertension; also has bilateral effusions and atelectasis
   likely contributing.  Was treated for CAP though not much evidence of
   this on imaging.  Also appears to have some pulmonary edema which may
   be due to RV overload stressing LV and cardiac output.  Could consider
   ASD with now R->L shunting, age not fitting.
   - Pulmonary hypertension workup as above.
   - Diurese now with lasix gtt; consider vasodilators and inotropes.
   - O2 to maintain sats > 92% as PA HTN may be worsened in setting of
   hypoxic vasoconstriction.
   - Patient DNI.
   .
   # CAP.  Received levofloxacin 750 mg QOD (with current GFR), completed
   course today.  No consolidation on today's imaging.
   - No further antibiotics planned.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: baseline reportedly ~1.0, has been in
   the 1.2-1.5 range here and at OSH.  Mild proteinuria and abnormal
   microscopy with RBCs and WBCs. Did receive contrast at OSH (though
   elevation present prior to scan).  Acute change differential includes
   hypoperfusion from heart failure, ATN from a number of sources (which
   was thought to be the case at OSH).  Relatively stable since admission.
   - Obtain baseline numbers (?baseline proteinuria).
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - follow UOP
   - consider renal input.
   .
   # Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: patient was seen by OSH hematologist who
   recommended that hydroxyurea be restarted at 500 mg QD; if Hct contiune
   to rise on QD dosing recommend increase to [**Hospital1 **].
   - cont ASA 81 mg
   - continue hydroxyurea for now
   .
   # HTN. At baseline takes nifedipine 30 mg CR and toprol XL 50 mg.
   - holding nifedepine and metoprolol.
   - Diuresing with care as above.
   .
   # ?Portal hypertension.  Evidence on CT chest.  Has ascites and
   splenomegaly with ?varices.  Ascites could be explained by R heart
   failure, but unclear if splenomegaly would also be seen (though
   splenomegaly likely could be explained by chronic [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**]).  If
   cirrhosis present, may explain pulmonary hypertension as well.  INR
   elevated to 1.5 at admission without explanation.  Albumin 3.6 (though
   2.9 on admission).  Transaminases normal and iron level normal
   (hemochromatosis unlikely).
   - Dedicated abdominal ultrasound.
   - Fe studies, hep serologies.
   - Consider formal liver involvement pending above findings.
   - Other workup based on above findings.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia. She was admitted to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure and is currently being managed under monitored settings.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure and potentially worsen hypoxemia. Vasodilators and inotropes may be considered for treatment.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, likely explained by V/Q mismatch in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension. Bilateral effusions and atelectasis may also contribute to the hypoxemia. Oxygen therapy is being used to maintain sats > 92%.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine of approximately 1.0, which has been in the range of 1.2-1.5 here and at OSH. There is mild proteinuria and abnormal microscopy with RBCs and WBCs. Acute changes could be due to hypoperfusion from heart failure or ATN from various sources. Monitoring baseline numbers, checking SPEP/UPEP, following UOP, and considering renal input would be appropriate.

4. Polycythemia: The patient's polycythemia should be managed according to the recommendations of the OSH hematologist."

   79F with hypertension and polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for
   workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, now transferred
   to MICU for diuresis and further management under monitored setting.
   # Pulmonary hypertension and RV failure.  Newly diagnosed, with
   symptoma x 1 month, however  RV dilation and hypertropy suggest longer
   chronicity.  Differential includes PAH (primary process, though would
   not expect at this age; related to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**] or possibly portopulmonary
   hypertension given abdominal findings) Rheum labs negative making
   scleroderma or other rheumatologic disorder given Raynaud's unlikely,
   HIV negative.  Also consider PH due to chronic thromboembolic disease
   but no evidence on CTA.  Unlikely due to LV dysfunction given echo
   findings; does not appear to have significant primary lung parenchymal
   disease to explain hypertension.  No known history of L->R shunting and
   would be old to present as such now.  ECHO bubble negative.  OSA alone
   very unlikely to cause this degree of PA HTN.
   - Await official report of PA cath hemodynamics.
   - Abdominal u/s with dopplers
   - Hold home CCB.
   - Making adequate urine on lasix gtt
   - If still with borderline O2 sats with diuresis and dobutamine can
   start epoprostenol.
   - Would benefit from coumadin in long term if no evidence of bleeding
   (care given ?portal hypertension and liver dysfunction).
   # Hypoxemia.  Likely explained by VQ mismatch in setting of severe
   pulmonary hypertension; also has bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
   Was treated for CAP though not much evidence of this on imaging, now
   s/p antibiotic course.  Also appears to have some pulmonary edema which
   may be due to RV overload stressing LV and cardiac output.  ECHO
   negative for  ASD or evidence of R->L shunting.
   - Pulmonary hypertension workup as above.
   - Diurese now with lasix gtt; consider vasodilators and inotropes.
   - O2 to maintain sats > 92% as PA HTN may be worsened in setting of
   hypoxic vasoconstriction.
   - Patient DNI.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: baseline reportedly ~1.0, has been in
   the 1.2-1.5 range here and at OSH.  Mild proteinuria and abnormal
   microscopy with RBCs and WBCs. Did receive contrast at OSH (though
   elevation present prior to scan).  Acute change differential includes
   hypoperfusion from heart failure, ATN from a number of sources (which
   was thought to be the case at OSH).  Relatively stable since admission.
   - follow UOP
   - trend cr
   # Hypernatremia: In setting of diuresis with lasix gtt.
   - Give 500mL D5W and check PM lytes
   # Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: patient was seen by OSH hematologist who
   recommended that hydroxyurea be restarted at 500 mg QD; if Hct contiune
   to rise on QD dosing recommend increase to [**Hospital1 **].
   - cont ASA 81 mg
   - continue hydroxyurea for now
   # HTN. At baseline takes nifedipine 30 mg CR and toprol XL 50 mg.
   - holding nifedepine and metoprolol.
   - Diuresing with care as above.
   # ?Portal hypertension.  Evidence on CT chest.  Has ascites and
   splenomegaly with ?varices.  Ascites could be explained by R heart
   failure, but unclear if splenomegaly would also be seen (though
   splenomegaly likely could be explained by chronic [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9725**]).  If
   cirrhosis present, may explain pulmonary hypertension as well.  INR
   elevated to 1.5 at admission without explanation.  Albumin 3.6 (though
   2.9 on admission).  Transaminases normal.  Hepatitis panel negative, Fe
   studies normal.
   - Dedicated abdominal ultrasound pending
   # FEN: low Na, fluid restrict

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia.
- She was transferred to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular (RV) failure.
- The patient has been on dobutamine and furosemide infusions.
- She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
- ECHO bubble showed cor pulmonale but no intracardiac shunt.
- CT chest showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed abdominal varices.
- The patient's rheum labs were negative, ruling out scleroderma or other rheumatologic disorders.
- HIV status is negative.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal failure with an elevated creatinine level.
- She also has hypernatremia, polycythemia, hypertension, and possible portal hypertension.
- The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure. This is a serious condition that can result in increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing shortness of breath, chest pain, and potentially heart failure.
2. Right Ventricular Failure: Due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle may become overwhelmed"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia, who was transferred to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and RV failure, with unclear etiology. She has been on dobutamine and lasix infusions for diuresis and further management under monitored setting.

The patient is also being treated for hypoxemia, likely explained by V/Q mismatch in setting of severe pulmonary hypertension. She has bilateral effusions and atelectasis, and was treated for CAP though not much evidence of this on imaging. The patient's pulmonary edema is improving with diuresis, likely from RV overload stressing LV and cardiac output. An echo was negative for ASD or evidence of R -> L shunting.

The patient is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, with baseline reported ~1.0 and now in the 1.2-1.5 range. There is mild proteinuria and abnormal microscopy with RBCs and WBCs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia. She was transferred to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure. She is currently on dobutamine and Lasix infusions, and her current vital signs include a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a non-rebreather mask. Her physical examination shows negative peripheral pulses and unassessed skin and neurologic status. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and RV failure, hypoxemia, acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, polycythemia, hypertension, and possible portal hypertension. The patient has chosen to be DNR/DNI and is currently on dobutamine, Lasix, and O2 therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has pulmonary hypertension and RV failure, which can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function, including heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen due to the underlying pulmonary hypertension, potentially leading to respiratory failure.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may progress to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, polycythemia, and newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure. She was transferred to the ICU for further management, including diuresis and monitoring. The patient has been on dobutamine and Lasix infusions. She has been making adequate urine output on Lasix. The plan is to stop dobutamine and start sildenafil today. An abdominal ultrasound with doppler is also planned. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure and potentially result in hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
2. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient's right ventricular function is compromised due to pulmonary hypertension, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of polycythemia and acute renal failure, which may worsen due to decreased renal perfusion caused by heart failure or contrast-induced nephropathy.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had resolved hypernatremia, but it could recur if fluid balance is not carefully managed.
5. Portal Hypertension: The patient has evidence of portal hypertension, which may be secondary to liver dysfunction or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. This can lead to complications such as varices and ascites.

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia, who was admitted to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular (RV) failure. She is currently receiving dobutamine and diuretics for cardiac support, as well as sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 94/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery and requires intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, RV failure, hypoxemia, acute on chronic renal failure, polycythemia, hypertension, and portal hypertension. Her renal function is compromised with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. She also has elevated liver enzymes and an INR of 1.5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia, admitted to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with RV failure. She has been transferred to MICU for diuresis and further management under monitored settings. The patient's current condition includes pulmonary hypertension and RV failure, hypoxemia, acute on chronic renal failure, polycythemia, hypertension, and portal hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening RV failure: The patient's right ventricular (RV) failure is already present, and there is a risk of it worsening due to pulmonary hypertension and other underlying conditions.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia, which could be explained by V/Q mismatch in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension. There is a need to maintain oxygen saturation above 92% while avoiding hypoxic vasoconstriction.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and there is an acute deterioration in renal function. Monitoring urine output and trending creatinine levels are important.
4. Polycythemia: The patient has polycythemia, and hydroxyurea therapy has been recommended. It is crucial to monitor hematological parameters closely.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted carefully due to the concurrent diuresis.
6. Portal hypertension: The patient shows evidence of portal"

   Dobutamine stopped: CI decreased to 2, SVR to 1268
   Lasix gtt stopped
   SBP 80-108/49-59
   80-89% on 6 ln.c.
   Exam: alert, conversant
   Lungs: few scattered rales
   CV: 2/6 SEM at LSB
   Abd: soft, nt, +bs
   Labs: BUN/Cr 30's/1.3 (unchanged), progressive increase in HCO3 to 35
   Imp: 79 y female with pHTN /cor pulmonale, no etiology identified with
   w/u.
   For pHTN, tolerated dobutamine d/c and lasix gtt discontinuation.
   Oxygen sats still low, reflective of the severity of pt
s pHTN and not
   expected to increase substantially though she feels improved with
   diuresis and sildenafil.
   Off lasix gtt, would change to IV lasix. If BP limits diuresis,  can
   decrease dose but increase frequency of lasix administration; Recent
   alkalosis suggests we may be approaching limits of how much further
   diuresis she will tolerate.
   For acute polycythemia, will restart hydroxyurea possibly tomorrow
   Hold nifedipine and hydralazine
   D/c cordis
   Social work involved-eventual plan is to transition to home hospice or
   rehab, as difficult living situation may preclude discharge home.
   Appears appropriate for floor transfer.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and polycythemia. She was transferred to the ICU for workup of new pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), right heart failure (cor pulmonale), benign hypertension, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure (ARF), hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and cirrhosis of the liver.

The patient presented with symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and RV failure. She was found to have a negative echo bubble, ruling out intracardiac shunt or LV failure. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) chest was also negative for intrapulmonary shunt or pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been started on sildenafil and dobutamine, with dobutamine recently stopped due to worsening in objective function. The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was pulled on [**11-19**].

The patient's hypoxemia is likely explained by a V/Q mismatch in the setting of severe pulmonary hypertension, as well as bilateral effusions and atelectasis. She has received an antibiotic course for CAP, and her respiratory status improved with aggressive diuresis. An echocardiogram (ECHO) was negative for atrial septal defect (ASD) or evidence of right-to-left shunting.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is currently"
