   has had 10-100K yeast on several urine cultures previously and it is
   unclear whether foley has been changed.  No other clear source of
   infection although blood, stool, c. diff pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculosis, and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and is currently receiving a course of antibiotics. The patient has been called out to the floor multiple times but has had repeat episodes of mucus plugging. He was transferred back to the ICU for a likely mucus plug.

The patient's current concerns include tachypnea/hypoxia, fever, and hypernatremia. He is much improved on 2L NC after deep suctioning by IP yesterday. Secretions were collected with 4+ PMNs and 2+ GPCs, with cultures pending. The patient has recent HCAP MRSA pneumonia, ongoing severe tuberculosis, and copious secretions causing mucus plugging. There is also concern for recurrent aspiration due to right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The patient is currently on NAC nebs, albuterol + ipratropium nebs standing, guaifenacin standing, and chest PT. He is also receiving frequent deep suctioning, head-of-bed elevation, and aspiration precautions. Vancomycin and ceftazidime are being continued due to persistent purulent secretions, fever, and right lower lobe infiltrate on CXR.

The patient's fever is likely due to recurrent pneumonia. No clear other source is identified, although he has had 10-100K yeast on several"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculosis, and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and a course of antibiotics. The patient has been transferred back to the ICU due to suspected mucus plugging. He is currently experiencing tachypnea and hypoxia, fever, delirium/dementia, anemia, and FEN issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea/Hypoxia: The patient's recent history of MRSA pneumonia, severe tuberculosis, and mucus plugging suggests that his respiratory system may be compromised. The ongoing severe tuberculosis and copious secretions could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory failure.
2. Fever: The patient's elevated body temperature indicates an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent the progression of the infection.
3. Delirium/Dementia: The patient's acute decompensation may be related to the mucus plug and associated infection. However, ongoing delirium could be due to prolonged hospitalization and ICU stay. Monitoring the patient's mental status and providing reorientation can help manage this condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. Monitoring the CBC daily and trending Hct will help assess the severity and determine appropriate interventions.
5. FEN (Feeding): The patient's removal of his Dobhoff tube"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with recurrent respiratory distress. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The vital signs indicate an elevated body temperature (101.2°F) and heart rate (97 bpm), as well as low blood pressure (105/52 mmHg). The respiratory rate is also elevated (29 breaths per minute), but the oxygen saturation remains at 100%.

The patient has a history of pneumonia (PNA) with chest X-ray changes, and there is suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefazidime, and a follow-up bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is planned.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF), which is likely pre-renal due to poor oral intake over the past few days. The plan is to hydrate the patient and monitor urine output and creatinine levels.

Hypernatremia is present, but the patient appears to be free water-replete today. Delirium is also noted, possibly due to infection, and efforts are being made to minimize medications and redirect the patient's attention.

The patient failed a swallowing study, indicating the need for further evaluation and possible placement of a feeding tube (dophoff).

Other issues discussed during rounds include nutrition, glycemic control,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with recurrent respiratory distress. He has a fever of 101.2°F and is experiencing bursts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His vital signs include a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/52 to 132/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is confused and has dry mucous membranes. He has coarse inspiratory rhonchi in his chest and no edema in his extremities. His neurologic status is alert and oriented to self and year. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis, antibiotics (Ceftazidime), and other ICU medications. He has not had any known drug allergies.

Lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 5.9 to 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 199-333, creatinine level of 1.0-1.3 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels between 78-96 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated levels of total CO2 and lactic acid, while calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH at 7.27. Imaging reveals increasing opacity in the right lower lung field on chest X-ray ("

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  87 yo male with TBM s/p Y-stenting and recent respiratory failure
   secondary to MRSA-PNA; called out to floor multiple times but with
   repeat episodes of mucus plugging, now transferred back to the ICU for
   resp failure.
   .
   #. MRSA PNA:  Recent h/o MRSA PNA, tachypnea, hypoxia, fever,
   infiltrate on CXR, BAL pos for MRSA. PNA also complicated by mucus
   plugging. Currently much improved on 2L NC after deep suctioning by
   IP/NSG. Vanco level subtherapeutic.
   -- NAC nebs, albuterol + ipratropium nebs standing; guaifenacin
   standing
   -- chest PT
   -- frequent deep suctioning, ok'ed by IP
   -- HOB elevation, aspiration precautions
   -- D/c ceftazideme as no report of aspiration related microbes by BAL
   cx
   -- Increase Vanco (Day #3) from q24 to q12hrs.
   -- CXR in am [**9-15**]
   .
   # Fever:  Likely due to recurrent PNA.  Other etiology includes yeast
   infxn as 10-100K yeast on several urine cultures previously.   BC-NGTD;
   c. diff negative.
   -- continue vanco as above.
   -- f/u stool cx
   -- change foley catheter
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolving; Currently at 143. Previous elevated Na due
   to NPO and inability to drink free water.
   - Will follow daily lytes and replete as needed.
   # Hypokalemia: Borderline low.  Repleted this am.
   -Will follow daily lytes and replete as needed
   .
   # Delirium/dementia:  acute decompensation may be related to mucus plug
   and associated infection, though ongoing delirium is more related to
   prolonged hospital course and ICU stays.
   -- infectious workup as above
   -- prn zyprex and haldol
   -- encourage reorientation
   -- avoid benzos
   -- organic w/u (TSH, RPR, B12) is negative.
   .
   # CRI:  Creatinine within baseline range.
   -- IVF: D51/2NS at 75cc/hr
   -- renally dose meds as indicated
   .
   #. Anemia: Currently at low of 25.9. baseline hct appears to run high
   20s-low 30s.  Anemia workup suggests ACD with possible underlying Fe
   deficiency considering low Fe.
   -- continue to monitor HCT
   .
   # FEN: NPO considering failed PO trial.
   -- Appreciate S&S.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of tuberculous bronchitis who recently underwent Y-stenting and experienced respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. He has been admitted multiple times due to mucus plugging and is currently back in the ICU for respiratory failure. 

The patient's current symptoms include a productive cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fever. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2-3 liters of nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals rhonchi bilaterally, more pronounced on the left side, with no wheezing. Neurological examination is not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an ongoing infection. Blood cultures from the bronchoalveolar lavage are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's blood glucose and electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but he has borderline low potassium levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. MRSA PNA: The patient has a recent history of MRSA pneumonia, characterized by tachypnea, hypoxia, fever, and infiltrates on chest X-ray. He has shown improvement on 2 liters of nasal cannula after deep suctioning.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  87 yo male with history of MRSA PNA, TBM, and recent respiratory
   failure, now s/p Y-stenting and course of antibiotics, called out to
   floor multiple times but with repeat episodes of mucus plugging, now
   transferred back to the ICU for a likely mucus plug.  Called out
   yesterday, called back [**1-13**] to increased secretions.
   .
   #. Tachypnea/Hypoxia:  Currently much improved on 2L NC after deep
   suctioning by IP yesterday.  BAL Cx=staph aureus, coag + suggesting
   MRSA.  Pt with recent HCAP MRSA PNA, ongoing severe TBM, and copious
   secretions causing mucus plugging. Does have RLL infiltrate concerning
   for recurrent aspiration.
   -- NAC nebs, albuterol + ipratropium nebs standing
   -- guaifenacin standing
   -- chest PT
   -- frequent deep suctioning, ok'ed by IP
   -- HOB elevation, aspiration precautions
   -- continue vanco/ceftaz currently given persistent purulent
   secretions, fever, and RLL infiltrate on CXR.
   .
   # Fever:  Likely due to recurrent PNA.  No clear other source although
   has had 10-100K yeast on several urine cultures previously and it is
   unclear whether foley has been changed.   BC-NGTD; c. diff negative.
   -- continue empiric coverage with vanc/ceftaz
   -- f/u stool cx
   -- change foley catheter and remove asap when MS improves further
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolving; Currently at 143. Likely due to NPO and
   inability to drink free water.
   -
   .
   # Delirium/dementia:  acute decompensation may be related to mucus plug
   and associated infection, through ongoing delirium is more related to
   prolonged hospital course and ICU stays.
   -- infectious workup as above
   -- prn zyprex and haldol
   -- encourage reorientation
   -- avoid benzos
   -- organic w/u (TSH, RPR, B12) is negative.

   # CRI:  Mild with baseline creatinine 1.0-1.2 generally, resolving from
   yest, now at 1.2.  Again, as above, suspect free water down given above
   and will given IVFs as outlined. Completed D51/2NS 2L yest.
   -- IVF
   -- renally dose meds as indicated
   .
   #. Anemia: Currently at low of 25.9. In review of labs (granted only
   have labs beginning [**8-29**] in our system), baseline hct appears to run
   high 20s-low 30s.  Normal MCV, elevated RDW.  B12 and folate normal on
   this admission.  Iron studies not checked. Suspect largely AOCD.
   -- continue to monitor given stability in hct
   -- check iron studies
   .
   # FEN: S&S as above. pt removed his Dobhoff tube on the floor with
   failed attempt yest at NGT placement. He is thirsty and free water down

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculosis, and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and a course of antibiotics. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to mucus plugging and was recently transferred back to the ICU for a suspected mucus plug. The patient is currently experiencing tachypnea/hypoxia, fever, hypernatremia, delirium/dementia, CRI (chronic renal insufficiency), anemia, and FEN (failure to thrive).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration: The patient has copious secretions causing mucus plugging, which can lead to recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
2. MRSA infection: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia and persistent purulent secretions, indicating a possible ongoing MRSA infection.
3. Tuberculosis (TBM): The patient has severe TBM, which can be complicated by respiratory failure and recurrent infections.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing acute decompensation, likely related to infection and prolonged hospital stay.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level due to NPO status and inability to drink free water, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI): The patient has mild CRI with baseline creatinine levels of 1.0-1.2, which may progress if not"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of tracheobronchial malfunction (TBM) who has recently experienced respiratory failure secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. He was transferred back to the ICU due to repeated episodes of mucus plugging. The patient's current condition is much improved on 2 liters nasal cannula after deep suctioning by the bedside nurse. His vancomycin levels are subtherapeutic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has a recent history of MRSA pneumonia, which was complicated by mucus plugging. There is a possibility of recurrent or persistent infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure and may be at risk for further episodes of respiratory distress or failure.
3. Mucus Plugging: The patient has had repeated episodes of mucus plugging, which can lead to airway obstruction and compromise ventilation.
4. Delirium/Dementia: The patient is showing signs of acute decompensation, which may be related to the prolonged hospital course and ICU stays.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which may be due to being NPO and unable to drink free water. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient has a borderline low potassium level and requires repletion.
7. Anemia: The patient's hem"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of tuberculous bronchitis (TBM) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to respiratory failure secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia (MRSA-PNA). The patient's recent admission was called out from the floor multiple times due to mucus plugging but was transferred back to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, fever, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is improving on 2 liters of nasal cannula with deep suctioning and chest physiotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA PNA: The patient has a recent history of MRSA PNA, which is a serious infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This infection can lead to further respiratory failure and complications.
2. Mucus Plugging: The patient has repeated episodes of mucus plugging, which can obstruct the airways and impede proper ventilation. This can lead to worsening respiratory status and may require invasive measures such as bronchoscopic clearance.
3. Delirium/Dementia: The patient is experiencing acute decompensation, which may be related to mucus plug and associated infection. The patient also has ongoing delirium, which is likely related to the prolonged hospital course and ICU stay. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and other"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of tracheobronchomalacia who recently underwent Y-stenting. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and experienced multiple episodes of mucus plugging. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient appears to be in no acute distress and is pleasant, speaking in partial sentences. Physical examination findings include perrla, eomi, normocephalic head, and bilateral rhonchi without wheezing. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, as well as borderline low potassium. The patient has been treated with vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and is currently on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula with deep suctioning and chest physiotherapy. The patient's recent medical history includes episodes of hematuria during Foley catheter replacement, fever likely due to recurrent pneumonia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, delirium/dementia, chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, and inability to tolerate oral intake.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been experiencing various medical events and interventions since admission. These include the placement of a Dopoff tube and a foley catheter, both of which were eventually removed by the patient. The patient also received doses of antibiotics (Ceftazidime and Vancomycin) on September 14th. Additionally, the patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate between 81-96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/76 to 130/95 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 78.4 kg, which is slightly lower than the admission weight of 79.6 kg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,944 mL and an output of 705 mL via various routes, resulting in a net fluid balance of 1,239 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 96%. 

Physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not performed on peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and tone. Laboratory results indicate abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  87 yo male with TBM s/p Y-stenting and recent respiratory failure
   secondary to MRSA-PNA; called out to floor multiple times but with
   repeat episodes of mucus plugging, now transferred back to the ICU for
   resp failure.
   #. MRSA PNA:  Recent h/o MRSA PNA, tachypnea, hypoxia, fever,
   infiltrate on CXR, BAL pos for MRSA. PNA also complicated by mucus
   plugging. Currently much improved on 2L NC after deep suctioning by
   IP/nursing. Vanco level subtherapeutic.
   -- NAC nebs, albuterol + ipratropium nebs standing; guaifenesin
   standing
   -- chest PT
   -- frequent deep suctioning, ok'ed by IP
   -- HOB elevation, aspiration precautions
   -- D/c ceftazidime as no report of aspiration related microbes by BAL
   cx
   -- Increase Vanco (Day #3) from q24 to q12hrs.
   -- CXR in am [**9-15**]
   # Fever:  Likely due to recurrent PNA.  Other etiology includes yeast
   infxn as 10-100K yeast on several urine cultures previously.
   BCx-NGTD; c. diff negative.
   -- continue vanco as above.
   -- f/u stool cx
   -- change foley catheter
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolving; Currently at 143. Previous elevated Na due
   to NPO and inability to drink free water.
   - Will follow daily lytes and replete as needed.
   # Hypokalemia: Borderline low.  Repleted this am.
   -Will follow daily lytes and replete as needed
   # Delirium/dementia:  acute decompensation may be related to mucus plug
   and associated infection, though ongoing delirium is more related to
   prolonged hospital course and ICU stays.
   -- infectious workup as above
   -- prn zyprex and haldol
   -- encourage reorientation
   -- avoid benzos
   -- organic w/u (TSH, RPR, B12) is negative.
   # CRI:  Creatinine within baseline range.
   -- IVF: D51/2NS at 75cc/hr
   -- renally dose meds as indicated
   #. Anemia: Currently at low of 25.9. baseline hct appears to run high
   20s-low 30s.  Anemia workup suggests ACD with possible underlying Fe
   deficiency considering low Fe.
   n        continue to monitor HCT
   n        would provide iron sulfate
   # FEN: NPO considering failed PO trial.
   -- Appreciate S&S.
   -- Speech and swallow re-eval on Monday
   -- Replace Dobhoff
   -- IVF: D51/2NS at 75cc/hr

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis (TBM) who recently underwent Y-stenting. He has been experiencing respiratory failure secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia (PNA). The patient was called out to the floor multiple times due to episodes of mucus plugging but was transferred back to the ICU for respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. MRSA PNA: The patient had a recent history of MRSA PNA, characterized by tachypnea, hypoxia, fever, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. BAL was positive for MRSA. The patient's condition improved after deep suctioning by the healthcare provider and is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC) with subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin.

2. Fever: The patient is likely experiencing recurrent PNA. Other potential causes include yeast infection, as indicated by the presence of 10-100K yeast on urine cultures. The patient has a negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test. Vancomycin will be continued as before, and follow-up stool culture is planned.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels are resolving. This was likely due to being NPO (nothing by mouth) and unable to drink free water. Daily electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yr old man with recurrent respiratory distress.  He has improved
   under care during this ICU admission
   1.       Resp Distress: due to mucus plugging and inadequate pulmonary
   toilet, as well as Staph PNA.  BAL done by IP is growing Staph aureus.
   Treating with vanco, which needs levels followed to ensure correct
   dosing.  Increase vanco since trough is low. Disposition to pulmonary
   rehab vs. floor in next couple of days if stable.  Keep in ICU for now
   given recurrent bouncebacks.
   2.       Fevers: likely PNA as outlined above, since fever curve has
   improved
   3.       ARF: stable/improved
   4.       Delirium: in setting of infection
 trying to minimize meds
   and work with redirection
   5.       Nutrition: failed swallowing study.  Self d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) 1475**] [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-enteric
   feeding tube.  S/S to re-eval tomorrow.  If does not tolerate, place
   NGT.

   Disposition :Transfer to floor with oximetry monitoring
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and is currently on antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 107/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination shows rhonchi in the right base of the lungs and decreased breath sounds in that area. His abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. Neurologically, he is alert and follows simple commands. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Chest X-ray reveals increased opacity in the right base of the lungs.

The patient's medical history includes recurrent respiratory distress, fevers, acute renal failure, delirium, and failure to pass a swallowing study. He has been receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and other medications including heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The plan is to continue aggressive pulmonary toilet and monitor for any complications. The patient will be transferred to the floor with oximetry monitoring once stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to mucus plugging or pneumonia, further decline in renal function, persistent delirium, and potential complications"
