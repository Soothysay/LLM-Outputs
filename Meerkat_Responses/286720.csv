   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Given intrathoracic stomach volvulus is on
   differential though extremely unlikely given patient is overall
   non-toxic.
   - Speak to GI re: timing of endoscopy
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <22 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.
   -Amp sublactam 3gm IV Q6hr
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   falling after hydration.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed, will d/w
   urology
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: This is a chronic problem.
   -TSH WNL and T4 pending
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.
   8)  FEN: NPO for now  with ice chips pending decision on EGD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She presented with one day of hematemesis, which is vomiting of blood, in the context of extensive aspirin use. The patient was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. She has a history of elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts and has had partial evaluations for a possible myeloid process in the past. The patient also has a known temporary stent that has not been removed, and she will be followed up with urology. She has a goiter on the right side of her neck, which is a chronic problem, and her thyroid function tests are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient likely has an upper gastrointestinal bleed, possibly due to aspirin use or stopping proton pump inhibitor (PPI) causing ulceration or gastritis/duodenitis. Given the intrathoracic stomach volvulus is on the differential though extremely unlikely given the patient's overall non-toxic appearance.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and has had partial evaluations for a myeloid process in the past. Potentially due to cat bite/infection as well as urinary tract infection (UTI) with vomiting and other reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.

   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use.  , gastric volvulus on differential, nsaid-induced
   ulcerations.  Admitted to [**2184**] with sepsis, noted to have GIB with
   coffee ground fluid from NGT, noted to have large hiatal hernia with
   resultant intrathoracic stomach, ?predispose to UGIB and gastritis,
   hpylori(-) at that time.
   - as per GI recommendations, surgery consult given concern for gastric
   volvulus
   - GI consult, addressing need for upper GI scope
   -PPI drip
   -IV's *2
   -Ondansetron PRN for nausea
    2. leukocytosis: of note has elevated white count on admit, has had
   leukocytosis in past, notes suggest past evaluation by hematopath,
   thought c/w inflammatory response.  Possible c/w infected cat bite
   though smoldering chronic process leading to leukocytosis is not
   clearly ruled out.  No abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting
   myeloid process.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -monitor
    3. EKG changes: Given flat CE's and other transaminases as well as
   diffuse and nonspecific pattern it is unlikely this is due to acute
   MI.  Would be concerned about demand ischemia.
   -Cycle CE's
   -Repeat ECG
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills to me but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites will initiate empiric
   treatment with ampicillin-sublactam.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was admitted to the ICU for an upper GIB assessment. The patient presented with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use. She has been diagnosed with a likely upper GIB, possibly due to NSAID-induced ulcerations. The patient also has a large hiatal hernia with an intrathoracic stomach, which may predispose her to upper gastrointestinal bleeding and gastritis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 96 bpm, a blood pressure of 142/66 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving intravenous fluids, pantoprazole drip, ondansetron PRN for nausea, and ampicillin-sublactam for a cat bite.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.7 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 31.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 461 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with sodium at 0.9 mg/dL, potassium at 26 mEq/L, chloride at 4"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of a cat bite, which led to cellulitis and subsequent treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam. There are also concerns about anemia, hypernatremia, and a right upper lobe (RUL) mass on imaging.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/47 mmHg to 158/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and their blood products balance shows a total input of 1,293 mL and total output of 395 mL. The patient's urine output is 395 mL as well.

The physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, and symmetric chest expansion. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. The patient has absent pulses in both radial and dorsal pedis arteries, indicating possible peripheral vascular compromise. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The skin is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of a cat bite, for which they are receiving antibiotics to cover usual cat bite pathogens. The patient also has anemia, leukocytosis, and hypernatremia.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals a thin appearance, warm skin, and an erythematous and edematous region on the dorsum of the right hand with an apparent cat bite injury. The patient's neurological examination is also documented.

Lab results indicate a low hemoglobin level, elevated white blood cell count, normal glucose level, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia. Other lab values such as platelet count, creatinine, PT/PTT/INR, and cardiac enzymes are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, likely secondary to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use after a cat bite. The patient is also being evaluated for endoscopy, and PPI therapy is planned. Additionally, large bore IV access has been established.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient presents with coffee ground emesis,"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
   2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts and
   has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially due
   to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other reasons
   for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No abnormal
   or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
   3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
   6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
   7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
   8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) presenting with hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use. She was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including leukocytosis, EKG changes, cat bite, and a probable urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's goiter has shown a slight increase in size on a recent CT chest scan. Social concerns have been raised regarding the patient's transportation issues and need for resources.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's history of GIB and recent hematemesis indicate a potential upper GIB. Further evaluation through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to identify the source of bleeding. The patient will continue to receive IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and transfusion for Hct <25 or Hct drop of >3 in six hours.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be due to a cat bite/infection or a UTI. Close monitoring of the leukocytosis and fever curve is necessary, and a repeat differential count is needed.
3. EKG changes: Although the EKG changes have improved, they were initially concerning for cardiac ischemia. The patient will be monitored for any cardiac symptoms, and negative"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) presenting with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use. She was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment. The patient has a likely upper GIB, possibly from aspirin use and stopping PPI causing ulceration or gastritis/duodenitis. She also has leukocytosis, EKG changes, a cat bite, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), and a goiter on the right side of her neck.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's history of GIB, along with the recent hematemesis, suggests a potential ongoing bleeding risk. Close monitoring and timely intervention are necessary to prevent further bleeding and stabilize the patient.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an infection or inflammation. It is important to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment to prevent complications associated with an elevated WBC count.
3. EKG Changes: The initial EKG changes may suggest ischemia or cardiac issues. Although they have improved, continued monitoring is essential to ensure the patient's cardiac status remains stable.
4. Cat Bite: The patient's cat bite requires prompt treatment due to the high rate of infection associated with such injuries. Proper antibiotics should be administered to prevent any potential complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
- Heart rate: 73 bpm (within normal range)
- Blood pressure: 106/40 mmHg (low systolic)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (elevated)
- Oxygen saturation: 94% (slightly low)

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, specifically ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,193 mL and output of 1,820 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 373 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rhythm of sinus rhythm with a blood pressure within the low end of the normal range.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin and anxious, with clear breath sounds and tender abdomen. The patient's extremities are absent pulses on the right side and not assessed on the left side. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (27.7 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (8.3 g/dL), slightly low platelet count (461 K/uL), normal creatinine (0.9 mg/dL), and normal glucose level (97 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with coffee ground emesis after taking NSAIDs for a cat bite. She has a history of presumed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease (PUD), likely exacerbated by NSAID use and discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased, prompting a plan for repeat packed red blood cells (PRBC).

The patient also has leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the site of the cat bite, for which she is being treated with ampicillin/sulbactam to cover usual cat bite pathogens. There is a concern for abscess formation.

Additionally, the patient has a goiter, as indicated by an increasingly tortuous trachea path on a chest X-ray. A repeat CT scan is planned to assess the size of the goiter. Further workup, including possible thoracic, endoscopic, or interventional procedure (IP) consults, will be determined based on the impact on the trachea and the patient's wishes. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) should be checked.

The patient has ureteral stents placed on [**2169**] and is being evaluated for a urinary tract infection (UTI). A urology consultation has been requested.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support and glycemic control. She"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with coffee ground emesis and a history of cat bite. She has multiple medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding (presumed upper gastrointestinal bleeding), a cat bite with leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the site, a goiter with a CT scan showing an increasingly tortuous trachea path, and ureteral stents in place for a urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (presumed upper gastrointestinal bleeding): The patient's presentation of coffee ground emesis suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to gastritis or peptic ulcer disease in the setting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use after a cat bite and discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. A decreasing hemoglobin level is noted, indicating ongoing blood loss.

2. Cat bite infection: The patient's leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the site of the cat bite suggest an infection. Antibiotics (Ampicillin/Sulbactam) have been initiated to cover usual cat bite pathogens. However, the fluctuance of the bite site indicates the need for drainage.

3. Goiter: The patient has a goiter, as evidenced by a CT scan showing an increasingly tortuous trachea path. This suggests an enlarging size of the goiter, which may impact airway patency. Further evaluation is"

   Multiple bilateral renal calculi are again demonstrated. A few 2-3 mm
   calculi
   are seen adjacent to the right NU stent, in the mid-distal portion of
   the
   ureter in the pelvis.
   2. The bladder is distended, and there is a focus of gas within the
   bladder,
   possibly related to instrumentation. Please correlate.
   3. Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
   4. Probable cholelithiasis.
   5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.

   Assessment and Plan
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
    1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Patient with likely upper GIB probably
   from ASA use +/- stopping PPI causing ulceration or
   gastritis/duodenitis.  Chest CT [**3-5**] ruled out volvulus but showed
   unchanged hiatal hernia.
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with history of HTN, depression, and GIB presenting
   with one day of hemetemesis in the context of extensive ASA use
   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the context
   - EGD per GI today
   - Continue IV PPI drip
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 in six hours, Check Hct Q 6
   hrs
    2)  Leukocytosis:  The patient has a history of elevated WBC counts
   and has had partial evals for myeloid process in the past.  Potentially
   due to cat bite/infection as well as UTI with vomiting and other
   reasons for elevated WBC count though this still seems quite high.  No
   abnormal or left shifted forms suggesting failure of myeloid
   differentiation.
   -treat cat bite per below
   -trend leukocytosis and fever curve, repeat diff in AM
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam. Today, area of bite is fluctuant. Pt has
   consented to drainage of abscess
   -needle drainage of abscess after EGD with pt sedated today
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to follow.
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that has not been removed- per
   urology ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) wanted KUB this am. Now would like CT non
   contrast abd and pelvis to look for hydro and stent placement. Will
   discuss this with pt today.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She presented to the ICU with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use. The patient has multiple comorbidities including high blood pressure, depression, and a previous gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has multiple ulcerations in the gastrointestinal tract, which could lead to further bleeding.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be due to an infection from a cat bite or a urinary tract infection.
3. EKG changes: The patient initially had EKG changes suggestive of ischemia, but these have improved on repeat ECG.
4. Cat Bite: The patient has a cat bite with a fluctuant area, indicating the possibility of an abscess formation.
5. Renal Calculi: The patient has bilateral renal calculi, which may cause hydronephrosis and further complications.
6. UTI: The patient has signs of a urinary tract infection, including pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase.

Please note that this is a summary and not an exhaustive list of potential medical complications. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan for the patient."

   admitted to icu for upper GIB assessment.
   1.) Gastrointestinal Bleed:  Due to multiple ulcerations in the
   context  of high dose aspirin use.  On [**Hospital1 7**] PPI and hematemesis and
   symptomatology has largely resolved.  Hct stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] PPI, transition to PO today and will continue for the near
   future.
   -Two peripheral IV
s, active type and cross
   -Ondansetron and metoclopramide PRN for nausea
   -Transfuse for Hct <25 or Hct drop of > 3 between checks, Check Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
    2)  Leukocytosis:  Improving currently w/ treatment of cat bite and
   the patient
s other processes.  Still, she has long had elevated white
   counts and this deserves further work-up for primary heme process.
   -treat cat bite per belowe
   -Arrange heme f/u as o/p
    3.) EKG changes:  These are improved on repeat ECG, which seems
   consistent with resolution of demand ischemia as tachycardia and anemia
   were treated.  Patient now with two sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
   -will monitor for any cardiac sx
    4. Cat Bite: Patient denied fever, chills in ICU but reported in ED.
   Given high rate of infection of cat bites empirically treating with
   ampicillin-sublactam.  Added vanc as patient is MRSA positive pending I
   and D but may d/c after culture negative.
    5.)  [**Last Name (un) **]: Most likely Cr elevation due to dehydration/prerenal.  Cr
   now down to 0.8.
   -Continue to trend
    6) Probable UTI: Probable UTI given pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
   esterase.
   -UTI most likely E coli given nitrites which should be covered by
   amp-sublactam, no further abx at this time but will f/u cx
   -Patient with known temporary stent that is misplaced.  Urology would
   ideally like percutaneous drain but serious question if the patient
   wants at home and no indication that this is a procedure she needs
   immediately.
    7)  Goiter on R side of neck: TSH and T4  WNL  this admission. Goiter
   slightly larger on CT Chest [**3-5**]
   -arrange o/p endocrine f/u
    8) Social: Pt lives alone and reports trouble getting to MD [**Last Name (Titles) 5915**]
   (though cat sees vet 2*/yr) Will get SW involved to find resources for
   this very pleasant lady.  She seems to have trouble with transportation
   and will talk to social work about this.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension, depression, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with one day of hematemesis in the context of extensive aspirin use. She was admitted to the ICU for upper GIB assessment.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple ulcerations in the gastrointestinal tract, which is likely the cause of her hematemesis. She has been started on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and has shown improvement with symptomatology resolution. Her hematocrit (Hct) levels have stabilized.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is improving with treatment of a cat bite and other processes. It is mentioned that she has had elevated white counts in the past, indicating the need for further work-up for a possible primary hematologic process.

There are also EKG changes that have improved on repeat ECG, suggesting resolution of demand ischemia due to treatment of tachycardia and anemia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no ongoing cardiac damage.

The patient has a cat bite on her hand, for which she has been empirically treated with ampicillin-sulbactam. Vancomycin was added due to the patient's MRSA positivity, but may be discontinued if the culture is negative.

There is mention of probable chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to dehydration or prerenal causes, with creatinine levels now down to 0"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and sepsis. The patient presented with coffee ground emesis and has a history of taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after a cat bite. The patient also has a positive MRSA screen and infected cat bite site with leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis.

24-hour events include an upper endoscopy that revealed multiple ulcers but no active bleeding. The patient underwent incision and drainage (I&D) of the hand due to a cat bite, and vancomycin was added for MRSA coverage. The patient also has ureteral stents placed and is being evaluated for a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of NSAID use after a cat bite and discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient underwent a scope that showed multiple ulcers but no active bleeding. The plan includes continuing PPI, GI recommending surgical correction of thoracic stomach, and follow-up with [Doctor's Name].

2. Cat bite: The patient has leukocytosis and redness/cellulitis at the site of the cat bite. The plan includes administering ampicillin/sulbactam to cover usual cat bite pathogens, adding vancomycin for MRSA coverage,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of a cat bite, presenting with coffee ground emesis and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of NSAID use and cessation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple ulcers but no active bleeding. The patient is also suspected to have MRSA infection at the site of the cat bite and has a positive MRSA screen. There is a recommendation for surgical correction of thoracic stomach by the GI team. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/60 mmHg to 145/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, PPI, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient has a history of GIB, as indicated by coffee ground emesis and confirmed by the upper endoscopy findings. The patient may continue to experience bleeding or develop further complications related to the ulcers in the stomach.
2. Infection at the site of the cat bite - The patient has signs of infection at the site of the cat bite, including leukocytosis and redness/cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with coffee ground emesis and a history of taking NSAIDs after a cat bite. The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) secondary to peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in the setting of NSAID use. She underwent an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple ulcers but no active bleeding. The patient also has a positive MRSA screen and cultures of the NG tube drainage have been sent for analysis. She has been started on antibiotics to cover usual cat bite pathogens and MRSA coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's presentation with coffee ground emesis indicates ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of further bleeding leading to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, likely at the site of the cat bite. Failure to appropriately treat the infection may lead to worsening cellulitis or systemic infection.
3. Urinary tract infection: The patient has ureteral stents in place due to a previous urinary tract infection. There is a risk of reinfection or worsening of the current infection, especially with instrumentation.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilized state in the ICU increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures should"
