","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, who was transferred from OSH with GI bleed and a small right frontal intraparenchymal contusion. She has been experiencing anxiety, pale conjunctiva, and dilated pupils. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.0Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 131/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on pantoprazole infusion and morphine sulfate. The patient's blood tests show slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient has multiple hematomas on her back, abdomen, and legs, and tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants of her abdomen. She also has a history of unable to walk and reports last drink 48 hours prior to admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and presentation with hematemesis and melena suggest a possible GI bleed, possibly from a variceal bleed or peptic ulcer disease.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's diffuse abdominal pain with guarding, along with the CT scan findings of a large pelvic dermoid or teratoma and low-density pancreatic lesion, raise suspicion for acute on chronic pancreatitis.
3. Trauma: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, several significant events have occurred within the past 24 hours.

The patient received one unit of blood due to a low hematocrit (HCT) level. A trauma consult was requested regarding images, but no fractures were found in the cervical spine. There are multilevel degenerative joint disease (DJD) in the cervical spine, most significant at levels C5-C6, with posterior osteophytes impinging anteriorly on the thecal sac. A CT scan is not sensitive for intrathecal details, and an MRI of the c-spine is pending. The patient is also being held in [**Location (un)**] J until the MRI results are available. Hip imaging is pending as well.

A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a large pelvic dermoid or teratoma, a low-density pancreatic lesion that cannot be fully characterized, and possible cystic side branches at the pancreatic tail, which cannot exclude intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).

The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion at 8 mg/hour and morphine sulfate for pain management. Other medications and allergies are not specified.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, are within normal ranges.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with several significant findings. The patient received a blood transfusion and experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 28.9% to 25.4%. There were also concerns regarding the patient's cervical spine, as a CT scan showed multilevel degenerative joint disease (DJD) at the C5-C6 level with posterior osteophytes impinging anteriorly on the thecal sac. A trauma consult was requested, and the patient is pending an MRI of the cervical spine.

Additionally, the patient has a large pelvic dermoid or teratoma, low-density pancreatic lesion, and possible cystic side branches at the pancreatic tail. These findings suggest potential complications in the abdomen and pancreas.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate between 76-113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/83 to 142/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on pantoprazole infusion and morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with anxiety, dilated pupils, pale conjunctiva, and tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left quadrants of the abdomen. The patient also has multiple hematomas on the back, abdomen, legs, and hip"

   1. Large pelvic dermoid or teratoma.
   2. Low density pancreatic lesion (2:57), not fully characterized on
   this study could be a pseudocyst given the evidence for chronic
   pancreatitis; however focal pancreatatis, or cystic neoplasm cannot be
   excluded. Further evaluation wth multiphase CT pancreas, or MRI can be
   done, as clinically warranted. Mild fat stranding around the pancreatic
   head and uncinate process, could suggest pancreatatis in appropriate
   clinical setting, and correlation with lipase is recommended. 3.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, who was transferred from the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding and a small right frontal intraparenchymal contusion. She is currently in the ICU due to multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presented with hematemesis and melena, indicating an upper GI source. Possible causes include variceal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), or arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The patient is receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and is being actively scoped.

2. Trauma: The patient fell multiple times at home, leading to pinpoint cervical neck tenderness and multiple hematomas on her legs, back, right hip, and abdomen. This suggests possible diffuse injuries. Repeat noncontrast head CT, CT of the cervical spine, plain film hip, pelvis, and trauma consult are recommended.

3. Acute on chronic pancreatitis: The patient is experiencing diffuse abdominal pain with guarding, mostly in the right upper and lower quadrants. Laboratory evidence does not suggest cholecystitis or alcoholic hepatitis. Ischemic colitis is also a possibility. The patient is NPO, and further evaluation with CT abdomen/pelvis and surgical consult is needed.

4. Alcoholism: The patient reports her last drink 48 hours prior to admission. She may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse. She was transferred from the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding and a small right frontal intraparenchymal contusion. She has been experiencing confusion, mixed signs of withdrawal, and delirium. The patient is currently on several medications including morphine sulfate, diazepam (Valium), and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 120/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on mechanical ventilation but not receiving supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and slightly low platelet count. Her liver enzymes are within normal range, but her creatinine level is slightly elevated. Other lab values are mostly within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient likely has an upper gastrointestinal bleed, possibly due to variceal bleeding related to alcohol abuse or peptic ulcer disease. An upper endoscopy is planned for this morning. She is receiving a proton pump inhibitor drip and will undergo hct fusion if hemodynamic instability occurs.
2. Trauma: The patient has multiple injuries including a small right frontal contusion, cervical neck tenderness, and hematomas on her legs, back, right hip, and"

   No Micro Data
   [**8-16**] CT C-Spine:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No fracture seen in the cervical spine. Multilevel degenerative
   changes
   in the cervical spine, most significant at level C5-C6 with posterior
   osteophytes impinging anteriorly on the thecal sac. CT is not sensitive
   for
   intrathecal details as MRI.
   2. Radiolucent line through the right occipital bone extending in the
   foramen
   magnum ring, with well-corticated margins, of indeterminate age. No
   associated soft tissue swelling and no associated air-fluid levels.
   Discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5472**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9126**] at the time scan done.
   NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above findings. Note
   that
   the occipital bone fracture crosses the midline superiorly and that it
   has the
   potential to compromise multiple dural sinuses if it is acute.
   [**8-16**] CT Chest / Abd / Pelvis
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Findings most consistent with acute on chronic pancreatitis. However
   there
   is an abrupt change in caliper of the pancreatic duct in the bosy of
   the
   pancreas and an obstructing tumor while not seen on this single phase
   study
   cannot be entirely excluded. Further evaluation should commence with
   correlation with outside studies to evaluate stability of this finding.
   Further radiologic evaluation can be attempted with multiphase pancreas
   CT
   scan, or MRI/MRCP, although follow-up multi-phase CT after resolution
   of acute
   symptoms would be most useful.
   2. Large ovarian dermoid

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse. She was transferred from another facility with gastrointestinal bleeding, a small right frontal intraparenchymal contusion, pancreatitis, and now presents with altered mental status. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and agitation, which may be due to toxic-metabolic causes or ICU delirium. She is currently receiving haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation and will have her orientation checked frequently. Further tests, including an EKG in the morning, urine toxicology, and urinalysis, are recommended.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GI bleed, most likely from a peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or variceal bleed. An upper endoscopy is planned for this morning to identify the source of bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) IV BID and blood transfusion for low hemoglobin levels are also part of the management plan.

3. Trauma: The patient fell multiple times at home, resulting in multiple hematomas on her legs, back, right hip, and abdomen. She has pinpoint cervical neck tenderness, indicating possible cervical spine injury. An MRI for C-spine clearance is recommended, and trauma surgery recommendations should be followed.

4. Hip Fracture: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, who was transferred from the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding and a small right frontal intraparenchymal contusion, pancreatitis, urinary tract infection, and altered mental status. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), trauma with potential hip fracture, pancreatitis, alcoholism, and possible upper gastrointestinal bleed with melena and hematemesis. The cause of the GIB may be from a variceal bleed due to alcoholism or NSAID-induced peptic ulcer disease (PUD). There is also a possibility of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 102/67 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), low platelet count (126,000/mm3), low hemoglobin (9.4 g/dL), and elevated creatinine (1.7 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal range.

Radiology findings include a small nondisplaced fracture at the nonweightbearing portion of the left greater trochanter. A CT scan of the head shows a hyperdense focus, which"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an elderly female with a history of alcohol abuse.
- She was admitted to the ICU due to falls and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Imaging tests revealed a hyperdense focus in the head, which appears to be blood, possibly an arteriovenous malformation (AVM).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range and blood pressure within acceptable limits.
- She is oxygenating well, with a SpO2 of 99%.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,799 mL and output of 855 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 944 mL.
- Laboratory results indicate slightly low hemoglobin levels and slightly elevated white blood cell count.
- Other lab values are within normal limits.
- The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) for gastric protection and haloperidol (Haldol) and lorazepam (Ativan) for agitation and violence.
- The patient's condition has been assessed as a full code, and she may be transferred to the floor if her behavior improves.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Fall-related injuries: The patient has experienced falls, which could lead to further injuries, especially considering her agitation and violent behavior.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen if not properly managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, small right frontal intraparenchymal contusion, pancreatitis, and urinary tract infection. The patient presented with altered mental status, pinpoint cervical neck tenderness, multiple hematomas on legs, back, right hip, and abdomen. Imaging revealed small bilateral subdural effusions, a tiny occipital subdural hematoma, and linear increased signal at the inferior right frontal lobe, which appears to be secondary to hemorrhagic contusion. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various causes, including the head injury, alcohol withdrawal, or an underlying infection. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and appropriate management, such as the use of haloperidol and lorazepam, are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of urinary tract infection and is currently on antibiotics. There is a possibility of developing other infections, especially in the ICU setting. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will help prevent and manage any potential infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding events. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation profile,"
