","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of cardiac conditions, including coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and the use of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with intracranial hemorrhage. The patient experienced fatigue, chest pain, and syncope, which could be related to his cardiac history. His vital signs were stable, with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation at 99%. He was on mechanical ventilation and had atrial fibrillation. The patient received vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). His CT scan showed multiple foci of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, worsening compared to the prior scan, involving dependent portions of bilateral posterior ventricular horns. There was also a new right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and possible left tentorial subdural hematoma. The patient had left preseptal soft tissue swelling and bilateral subcutaneous gas in the lateral temporal soft tissues, but no underlying fracture. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening of intracranial hemorrhage: The patient already has multiple foci of bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and new intraparenchymal hemorrhage. These hemorrhages can continue"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of cardiac issues such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He presents with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and other medical complications. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate (HR) of 95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 132/75 to 141/79 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on a nasal cannula. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.

The patient received vitamin K, profiline, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for the SAH, and his blood pressure is well-controlled without specific therapy. He is also on dilantin prophylactically. The plan is to discuss with neurosurgery regarding the best approach to monitoring and therapy for the SAH.

In addition to the SAH, the patient may also have syncope (possible), acute renal failure (ARF) versus chronic kidney disease (CKD), CAD, and AFib. He is on darbepoetin chronically, which suggests chronic kidney disease. The patient's cardiac device suggests a high risk, and an echo, telemetry, and infectious workup have been ordered.

   24 Hour Events:
   -cardiology was consulted regarding his weird bypass of AoV. They said:
   re afib (would bblock if HR >120, aiming for bp per neurosurg). ok to
   not be on coumadin for afib. Re bypass graft ask [**Hospital1 49**] why it was placed,
   but regardless, would not anticoagulate for now. Monitor for emboli to
   legs as this is where they would go from the conduit. also give lasix
   for chf.
   -cards wanted op report from [**Hospital1 **] which is now in his chart under osh
   records. the op procedure was left thoracotomy and left ventricular
   apex-to-descending aortic valve conduit.
   -started lopressor 12.5 tid for goal HR <120s and goal SBP 100-140,
   could titrate up prn or switch to carvedilol (his home med). I liked
   that lopressor was a little shorter acting for now.
   -neurosurg would like head CT in am before their rounds rather than
   this evening. will need to talk to neurosurg at some point soon about
   when to restart coumadin.
   -called micro lab to confirm they are testing sensitivities on
   enterococcus from urine, which they are
   -per daughter, pt on O2 at baseline and incontinent at home. may need
   to go to [**Hospital1 **] after discharge
   -restarted the following home meds: crestor 20 daily, iron, prilosec 20
   daily, colace 100 [**Hospital1 **], celexa 20 qam, neurontin 100 [**Hospital1 **], tums 500 [**Hospital1 **],
   vitamin 1 tab qam
   -did not restart these home meds: asa 81, K 10mgEq qam, 20mEq qpm,
   klonopin 0.25 qam, coumadin 6mg po qpm, coreg 3.125mg bd, lasix 120
   qam, 80 qpm, lisinopril 2.5mg po daily

   HEAD CT:
   Slight interval increase in size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
   right
   temporoparietal region. Slight increase in the amount of blood layering
   dependently in the lateral ventricles. Otherwise, no interval change.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old male with known multiple medical problems (though unclear
   chronicity and level of debility) as well as on chronic anticoagulation
   for AF presenting after a fall today with subarachnoid hemorage.
   Patient remains neurologically intact but as exact mechanism of fall is
   unclear and the  the patient has signs of old CAD he has been admitted
   to medicine for work up and monitoring.
   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range); need repeat
   albumin to further determine level
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -touch base with neurosurgery to determine need for Q2 neurochecks
   -neurosurgery recs suggest no coumadin for at least 30 days; risk of
   embolus per month is low.  Needs follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1703**]
   ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8464**]) in 4 weeks, will need noncontrast head CT beforehand.
   .
   2)  Atrial fibrillation
 HRs 70s
 low 100s.
   -Consider beta blockade if HR > 120 but only if can maintain BP goals
   suggested by neurosurgery.
   -Low CHADS score (age and CHF)  so would not resume anti-coag until
   cleared to do  so by neurosurgery
   .
   3) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3 and currently at goal.
   -Continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   5) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   6) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   7) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, on chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, presenting after a fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is neurologically intact but has signs of old coronary artery disease. He has been admitted to the ICU for monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has increased size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region and blood layering dependently in the lateral ventricles. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure within the goal range of 100-140 mmHg as per neurosurgery recommendations are crucial to prevent further bleeding.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is in the low 100s, and he has a low CHADS score. Considering beta-blocker therapy if heart rate exceeds 120 bpm but only if it can be maintained within the suggested blood pressure goals by neurosurgery. The decision to resume anti-coagulation should be cleared by neurosurgery.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is currently at goal. Continuing to hold coumadin in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Repeat head CT should be done before considering restarting coumadin.

4. Syncope: The patient experienced a syncopal episode, but it could be due to concussion/head trauma rather than loss of"

   1) Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal SBP's from 100 to 140 per neurosurgery
   and he is staying well there without any particular intervention.
   Coagulation reversed. Neurosurg following.
   -Bblocker for SBP>140 (as tachycardic, and ?in afib vs. MAT), fluids
   for SBP<100; gave fluids last night
   -continue dilantin, level is 16.1 ([**9-14**] is normal range)
   -CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very
   little change
   -Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM
   -will have to consult with neurosurg/cards in future regarding
   necessity of anticoagulation in long term for graft. Definitely should
   not be on coumadin in short term given extent of bleed.
   -Consider adding calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm
   2) Coagulopathy: Goal INR is 1.3.  Now reversed to 1.2 s/p 2 units FFP
   -will continue to hold coumadin in setting of SAH
   3) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   4) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   5) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   6) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems who presented after a fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was on chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. The patient remains neurologically intact but has signs of old cardiovascular disease. He is admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has an increased size of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and blood layering dependently in the lateral ventricles. The goal is to maintain stable blood pressure between 100-140 mmHg per neurosurgery recommendation. The patient's coagulation has been reversed, and a repeat head CT will be done in the afternoon.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 24.8, which is higher than the desired level of 1.3. Two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) have been given to reverse the coagulopathy. Coumadin will be held due to the extent of bleeding.

3. Syncope: The patient experienced a syncopal episode, but it may have been due to concussion or head trauma rather than loss of consciousness. No additional information was provided by the family.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an enterococcus infection in the urine and is symptomatic. Ampicillin has been started.

5. Hypotension: The patient had a brief episode of hypotension in the emergency department that responded to IV fluids. Currently, the patient appears euvolemic.

6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient is on darbepoetin, which raises suspicion of CKD. It is important to obtain outside records to verify this. Prerenal azotemia may also be present due to fluid-responsive hypotension.

7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes should be monitored, and repletion should be done as needed.

8. Pneumonia prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for pneumonia, so prophylactic measures should be taken.

9. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness, so prophylaxis should be given.

10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for VAP, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent it.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his subarachnoid hemorrhage, coagulopathy, potential UTI, hypotension, CKD, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, pneumonia prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis."

   .
   4) Syncope: ?syncopal episode and think patient's lack of memory likely
   due to concussion/head trauma not necessarily loss of consciousness.
   Family provided no additional info.
   -as per EP, no arrhythmic events of pacer
   -UA w/ enterococcus and pt symptomatic. Will start ampicillin
   -Echo subobtimal study- unclear extent of AS, severe LV hypokinesis;
   would consider repeating echo; consulting cardiology in light of echo
   results; should contact outpatient cardiologist regarding cardiac
   surgery
   5) Hypotension: Brief episode of hypotension to 80's in ED that
   responded well to small amount of IV fluids.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   -Monitor
   6) Hx CAD: No signs of active ischemia.  No ASA given bleeding risk and
   no BB given concern for BP in setting of bleed.
   -CE stable x 3 sets
   -severe LV hypokinesis- cardiology consult
   7) CKD?: Patient is on darbepoetin which raises suspicion of CKD.  Will
   attempt to obtain outside records to verify.  Also possible some
   element of prerenal given fluid responsive hypotension.
   -Trend Cr, avoid nephrotoxins
   8) FEN: Replete lytes PRN, NPO for now
   9) PPx: Pneumoboots, Oral PPI
   10) Code: Full
   11) Dispo: pending neuro stability

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, presenting after a fall with subarachnoid hemorrhage. He remains neurologically intact but has signs of old coronary artery disease. He is admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and monitoring.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Goal systolic blood pressures between 100-140 mmHg per neurosurgery recommendations. He is well within this range without any particular intervention.
- Coagulation has been reversed.
- Neurosurgery is following up with the patient.
- Beta-blocker for SBP >140 (as tachycardic, and possibly in atrial fibrillation versus myocardial infarction), fluids for SBP <100; given fluids last night.
- Continue dilantin, level is 16.1 (normal range is 9-14).
- CT head in AM showed some increase in SAH; repeat CT in PM showed very little change.
- Q2 neuro checks and repeat head CT this PM.
- Will consult with neurosurgery/cards in the future regarding necessity of anticoagulation in the long term for graft. Definitely should not be on coumadin in the short term given the extent of bleed.
- Consider adding a calcium channel blocker to prevent vasospasm.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the low "
