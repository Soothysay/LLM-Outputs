   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital
   stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents
   from home with cough for one week found in the emergency room to be
   hypotensive to the 80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Septic Shock:  Etiology unclear.  She was off pressors for 3.5 hours
   last night but put back on for SBP 60s.  ScVO2 was 65 and lactate is
   flat.  Random cortisol of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   At this time with hypotension, low grade fevers and tachycardia concern
   for sepsis although source is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] CTA shows mild interstitial
   edema but no frank consolidations, urinalysis is negative, LFTs are
   unremarkable, blood cultures are pending.  History of cough, rhinorrhea
   and sore throat suggesting of a viral upper respiratory tract infection
   for which influenza would be in the differential.  Other considerations
   include hypotension secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral
   illness and diuretic use.  Cardiogenic shock is unlikely given lack of
   cardiac symptoms and normal EKG.  Currently with mildly decreased urine
   ouput, normal lactate, mild acute renal failure and confusion but
   unresponsive to fluid challenge and requiring levophed.
   - vancomycin, meropenem for empiric coverage of sepsis pending culture
   data
   - adding azithromycin for atypical PNA coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**] (given flash pul edema after 500cc x2 fluid boluses
   last night)
   - continue levophed as needed to maintain SBP> 90, UOP > 30 cc/hr; wean
   as tolerated
   - place arterial line today to better monitor BPs
   - f/u influenza swab
   - will hold metoprolol and bumetanide
   Hypoxia:  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent
   hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.  On presentation
   she was 91% on 2L and since fluid resuscitation has required 3-4L with
   saturations in the high 90s.  Evidence of mild interstial edema on exam
   but does not appear significant enough to account for oxygen
   requirement. No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.  No signs of
   hypercarbia on VBG.  Likely worse hypoxia after flash pulmonary edema
   earlier this morning.
   - holding home diuretics given hypotension
   - monitor for signs of volume overload
   - f/u influenza swab
   - outpatient pulmonary function tests
   - consider ABG to assess A-A gradient
   - albuterol PRN given expiratory wheezes
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  Hct
   drop from 31.2 to 26.6 last night.
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs to improve hypotension
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delerium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - evaluate for infection as above
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation in the
   110s.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - continue digoxin but will need to discontinue if renal failure
   worsens
   - holding metoprolol
   - on plavix as her antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name **], unclear why not on aspirin
   - not on anticoagulation given bleeding risk
   Acute Renal Failure:  Improving.  Likely prerenal in the setting of
   what appears to be septic shock.
   - monitor  urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold diuretics
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  Unclear if this is a new finding.
   - R lower extremity ultrasound today
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke and atrial fibrillation. She presents with cough for one week and was found to be hypotensive in the emergency room. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Septic Shock: The patient is suspected of having septic shock due to hypotension, low-grade fevers, and tachycardia. She was off pressors for 3.5 hours last night but required them again for a low systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 60s. ScVO2 was 65, and lactate levels are flat. A random cortisol level of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has persistent oxygen requirements since her recent hospitalization, despite no known primary lung disease. She requires 3-4 liters of oxygen with saturations in the high 90s. Evidence of mild interstitial edema on exam but does not appear significant enough to account for the oxygen requirement. No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA. No signs of hypercarbia on VBG.

3. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 30. Her hematocrit dropped from 31.2 to 26.6 last night. She is actively bleeding as indicated by positive guaiac stools."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, hypotension, and tachycardia. The source of sepsis is unclear, and she is currently on empiric coverage for sepsis. The patient also has hypoxia, acute renal failure, confusion, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic heart failure. She has been experiencing cough and rhinorrhea, suggesting a viral upper respiratory tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and fever suggest sepsis. It is important to identify the source of infection and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medications accordingly is crucial.
3. Hypoxia: Despite being on supplemental oxygen, the patient requires a high flow neb. Mild interstitial edema on exam may contribute to hypoxia, but further investigation is needed.
4. Confusion: The patient's mental status changes could be due to delirium or an underlying infection. Evaluating for infection and monitoring mental status are important.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heartbeat increases the risk of clot formation. Anticoagulation therapy should be considered, especially if renal function worsens"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital
   stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents
   from home with cough for one week found in the emergency room to be
   hypotensive to the 80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Septic Shock:  Etiology unclear.  At this time with hypotension, low
   grade fevers and tachycardia concern for sepsis although source is
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] CTA shows mild interstitial edema but no frank
   consolidations, urinalysis is negative, LFTs are unremarkable, blood
   cultures are pending.  History of cough, rinorrhea and sore throat
   suggesting of a viral upper respiratory tract infection for which
   influenza would be in the differential.  Other considerations include
   hypotension secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral illness
   and diuretic use.  Cardiogenic shock is unlikely given lack of cardiac
   symptoms.  Currently with mildly decreased urine ouput, normal lactate,
   mild acute renal failure and confusion but unresponsive to fluid
   challenge and requiring levophed.
   - vancomycin, meropenem for empiric coverage of sepsis pending culture
   data
   - follow blood cultures
   - will check CVP and consider additional fluid challenge if < [**10-20**]
   - will check ScVO2
   - continue levophed as needed to maintain MAP > 60, UOP > 30 cc/hr
   - will place arterial line if unable to quickly wean pressors
   - will check influenza swab given respiratory symptoms
   - will check random cortisol to assess for absolute adrenal
   insufficiency
   - will monitor lactate, urine output, CVP, ScVO2 and pressor
   requirement
   - will hold metoprolol and bumetanide
   Hypoxia:  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent
   hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.  On presentation
   she was 91% on 2L and since fluid resuscitation has required 3-4L with
   saturations in the high 90s.  Evidence of mild interstial edema on exam
   but does not appear significant enough to account for oxygen
   requirement. No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.
   - holding home diuretics given hypotension
   - monitor for signs of volume overload
   - check CVP now with goal [**10-20**] for resuscitation
   - influenza swab given symptoms
   - outpatient pulmonary function tests
   - VBG to assess for hypercarbia
   - consider ABG to assess A-A gradient
   - albuterol PRN given scarce expiratory wheezes
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delerium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - evaluate for infection as above
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - out of bed to chair in AM
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation in the
   110s.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - continue digoxin but will need to discontinue if renal failure
   worsens
   - holding metoprolol
   - on plavix as her antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name **], unclear why not on aspirin
   - not on anticoagulation
   Acute Renal Failure:  Likely prerenal in the setting of what appears to
   be septic shock.
   - monitor  urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Hematocrit:  Known iron deficiency anemia.  Baseline hematocrit 30.  At
   her baseline.
   - active type and screen
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold diuretics
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  Unclear if this is a new finding.
   - R lower extremity ultrasound in AM
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation. She presents from home with cough for one week, found hypotensive in the emergency room, and now in the ICU due to septic shock of unclear etiology. 

The patient has been started on vancomycin and meropenem for empiric coverage of sepsis, and blood cultures are pending. The plan includes checking CVP and considering additional fluid challenge if below 10-20, placing an arterial line if unable to quickly wean pressors, monitoring lactate, urine output, CVP, ScVO2, and pressor requirement, as well as holding metoprolol and bumetanide. 

Hypoxia is present, and the patient requires supplemental oxygen. The plan includes holding home diuretics given hypotension, monitoring for signs of volume overload, checking CVP now with a goal of 10-20, influenza swab given symptoms, and outpatient pulmonary function tests. 

Confusion is noted, and the patient's mental status is being monitored. Delirium is suspected, and the plan includes continuing home zyprexa and sertraline, evaluating for infection, monitoring mental status, frequent orientation, optimizing sleep-wake cycle, limiting medications that affect mental status, and out-of-bed-to-chair activity in the morning.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, cough, and pink sputum. She has a history of URI symptoms, hypertension, and was previously in rehab. She also has a niece who lives with her and became ill with similar symptoms. The patient is hypotensive and has been on levophed. She is experiencing low urine output and respiratory distress. Imaging shows diffuse ground glass opacities and evidence of acute decompensated heart failure. The patient's condition is unstable with hypoxemia, hypotension, and potential complications such as septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The diffuse ground glass opacities seen on imaging could indicate ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury that can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings may suggest pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
3. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF): The presence of bilateral pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggests acute decompensated heart failure. This condition occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs.
4. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and respiratory distress could be signs of sepsis, which is"

   evidence of acute decompensated heart failure - TTE with normal LVEF,
   likely acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction in the setting of volume
   overload and 2+MR, exacerbated by tachycardia when patient becomes
   agitated.

   Cardiogenic shock should be considered given rapid heart failure onset,

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of dyspnea, cough, and pink sputum. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing hypotension, which did not respond to fluid resuscitation. The patient is currently on levophed, a medication used to increase blood pressure, and requires supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. She has been diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure, likely acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction, as well as bilateral pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory status is stable with an oxygen saturation of 98% on 2L of oxygen. However, she is still experiencing hypotension and requires careful fluid management. 

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated platelet count (Plt). Her blood glucose level is within normal range, but her magnesium level is slightly low. Imaging studies reveal diffuse ground glass opacities and a tiny right-sided pleural effusion on the chest computed tomography angiography (CTA), and bilateral pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. 

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, atrial fibrillation, iron deficiency anemia, and acute renal failure. She is currently receiving various medications including vancomycin, azithromycin, furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and digoxin. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and further diagnostic tests such as blood cultures, respiratory viral screen, and urine cultures are pending. The assessment and plan include weaning off oxygen, using Lasix as needed for pulmonary edema, cautious fluid management, and considering cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to rule out cardiogenic shock. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU for dyspnea, cough, and pink sputum. She had been in rehab until two weeks ago and returned home with symptoms of a URI. Her niece, who lives with her, also became ill with similar symptoms. In the emergency department, she was hypotensive in the 70s and unresponsive, requiring two liters of IV fluids with no response, and was placed on levophed. She was previously on home oxygen for unclear reasons and started on diuretics for suspected congestive heart failure during her last admission.

Overnight, her urine output was low at one liter without change. A chest X-ray showed minimal volume overload. After receiving a bolus, she flashed and became tachypneic in the 40s. Lasix 20mg was given, followed by 40mg, along with morphine and ativan, which allowed her to be weaned off levophed briefly. However, she needed to be restarted on levophed again. Currently, she is on four liters of oxygen through a nasal cannula and will be kept on vancomycin overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels despite being on home oxygen and receiving supplemental oxygen in the ICU. This could be due to underlying respiratory issues such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia.

 HYPOXEMIA - on home O2 at 2L unclear reasons. Diffuse ground glass
   opacities could represent infectious etiologies, noninfectious
   etiologies hypersensitivity pneumonitis, new interstitial lung ds. TTE
   with normal LVEF, likely acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction in the
   setting of volume overload and 2+MR.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   no clear source at this time, could septic shock - patient's prodrome
   seems consistent with viral etiology vs. atypical bacteria. Lactate
   wnl. Cardiogenic shock should be considered given rapid heart failure
   onset, but cardiac enzymes in ED were negative. Also could be not
   associated with infectious etiology at all- could be secondary to blood

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted for dyspnea, cough, and pink sputum. She has a history of unclear reasons for home oxygen use and was previously in rehab. The patient's niece also became ill with similar symptoms. Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive and required IV fluids, but showed no response. She was then placed on levophed and a central venous line was inserted. The patient's overnight events included low urine output and a flash pulmonary edema episode. She was given lasix and morphine, which temporarily improved her condition. However, she needed to be restarted on levophed. The patient is currently on 4L of nasal cannula oxygen. Her allergies include penicillins and shellfish, while her last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on 08/30/2000 at 12:00 AM.

Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and pink sputum, along with the findings of diffuse ground glass opacities on CTA and bilateral pulmonary edema on CXR, suggest respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These conditions can lead to further respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of heart failure, as indicated by"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Septic Shock:  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off pressors since 2
   PM yesterday.  C. diff found to be positive, but does not explain CT
   chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Will recheck ScVO2 today
   for fluid management.  Random cortisol of 24.6 argues against adrenal
   insufficiency.  At this time with hypotension, low grade fevers and
   tachycardia concern for sepsis although source is unclear.  History of
   [**Name2 (NI) **], rhinorrhea sore throat, and ground glass opacities suggesting of
   a viral upper respiratory tract infection for which influenza and PCP
   would be in the differential.   Other considerations include
   hypotension secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral illness
   and diuretic use.  Cardiogenic shock is unlikely given lack of cardiac
   symptoms and normal EKG.  Currently with mildly decreased urine ouput,
   normal lactate, mild acute renal failure and confusion but unresponsive
   to fluid challenge.
   - d/c vancomycin, meropenem
   - continue azithromycin for atypical PNA coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - f/u influenza swab
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture
   - will hold metoprolol and bumetanide
   Hypoxia:  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent
   hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.  On presentation
   she was 91% on 2L and since fluid resuscitation has required 3-4L with
   saturations in the high 90s.  Evidence of mild interstial edema on exam
   but does not appear significant enough to account for oxygen
   requirement. No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.  No signs of
   hypercarbia on VBG.  Pulmonary edema likely due to cardiogenic causes
   as patient has moderate aortic stenosis.  Also on differential is
   influenza, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS secondary to sepsis.
   - holding home diuretics given hypotension
   - monitor for signs of volume overload
   - f/u influenza swab
   - outpatient pulmonary function tests
   - ABGs to assess oxygenation
   - nebulizers PRN
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  Hct
   24.6 today.  No active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - increase iron supplements to [**Hospital1 7**]
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delerium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled at 70s-90s on dilt and metoprolol.  No chest pain or
   shortness of breath.
   - continue digoxin, f/u digoxin levels this AM
   - discontinue metoprolol
   - transition to PO dilt TID
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatining trending up at 1.3 today.  Likely
   prerenal in the setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.
   ATN still remains in differential.
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes, UA
   - check urine sediment
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold diuretics
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She presents with altered mental status, hypoxemia, hypotension, and septic shock. The etiology of septic shock is unclear, but there are positive findings for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which does not fully explain the chest CT findings of ground glass opacities. The patient also has a history of rhinorrhea, sore throat, and ground glass opacities suggesting a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Other considerations include hypotension secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral illness and diuretic use, as well as cardiogenic shock, which is unlikely due to the lack of cardiac symptoms and normal EKG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, and has a fever, indicating potential sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but C. diff infection has been identified.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's oxygen requirements are high despite no known primary lung disease, and there is evidence of mild interstitial edema on exam. Pulmonary edema may be due to cardiogenic causes, but ARDS secondary to sepsis should also be considered.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a rising creatinine"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HYPOXEMIA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   cough for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Septic Shock:  Etiology unclear.  She was off pressors for 3.5 hours
   last night but put back on for SBP 60s.  ScVO2 was 65 and lactate is
   flat.  Random cortisol of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   At this time with hypotension, low grade fevers and tachycardia concern
   for sepsis although source is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] CTA shows mild interstitial
   edema but no frank consolidations, urinalysis is negative, LFTs are
   unremarkable, blood cultures are pending.  History of cough, rhinorrhea
   and sore throat suggesting of a viral upper respiratory tract infection
   for which influenza would be in the differential.  Other considerations
   include hypotension secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral
   illness and diuretic use.  Cardiogenic shock is unlikely given lack of
   cardiac symptoms and normal EKG.  Currently with mildly decreased urine
   ouput, normal lactate, mild acute renal failure and confusion but
   unresponsive to fluid challenge and requiring levophed.
   - vancomycin, meropenem for empiric coverage of sepsis pending culture
   data
   - adding azithromycin for atypical PNA coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**] (given flash pul edema after 500cc x2 fluid boluses
   last night)
   - continue levophed as needed to maintain SBP> 90, UOP > 30 cc/hr; wean
   as tolerated
   - place arterial line today to better monitor BPs
   - f/u influenza swab
   - will hold metoprolol and bumetanide
   Hypoxia:  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent
   hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.  On presentation
   she was 91% on 2L and since fluid resuscitation has required 3-4L with
   saturations in the high 90s.  Evidence of mild interstial edema on exam
   but does not appear significant enough to account for oxygen
   requirement. No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.  No signs of
   hypercarbia on VBG.  Likely worse hypoxia after flash pulmonary edema
   earlier this morning.
   - holding home diuretics given hypotension
   - monitor for signs of volume overload
   - f/u influenza swab
   - outpatient pulmonary function tests
   - consider ABG to assess A-A gradient
   - albuterol PRN given expiratory wheezes
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  Hct
   drop from 31.2 to 26.6 last night.
   - active type and screen
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs to improve hypotension
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delerium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - evaluate for infection as above
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation in the
   110s.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - continue digoxin but will need to discontinue if renal failure
   worsens
   - holding metoprolol
   - on plavix as her antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name **], unclear why not on aspirin
   - not on anticoagulation given bleeding risk
   Acute Renal Failure:  Improving.  Likely prerenal in the setting of
   what appears to be septic shock.
   - monitor  urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold diuretics
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted with cough and found to be hypotensive, unresponsive to fluid challenge. She has altered mental status, hypoxemia, and hypotension not responsive to fluids or vasopressors. The patient is suspected of having septic shock, possibly secondary to a viral respiratory infection. She is currently on vancomycin and meropenem empiric coverage for sepsis. Other assessments and plans include hypoxia, anemia, confusion, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, right lower extremity edema, cerebrovascular disease, and prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, altered mental status, and tachycardia suggests sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, and the patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and requirement for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may progress to ARDS, which is a serious complication often associated with sepsis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure could worsen due to sepsis and inadequate perfusion.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: Although less likely given the patient's normal EKG"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted with hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's complicated volume status, tachypnea, pulmonary edema, and positive stool culture for Clostridium difficile indicate a possible diagnosis of septic shock. The patient's respiratory distress, agitation, and ground glass opacities on the CT scan suggest a possible diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's acute renal failure, low urine output, and elevated creatinine level may be due to prerenal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis. The patient's anemia, mental status change, and positive c.difficile test indicate the need for transfusion and antibiotic treatment. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is critically ill. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, further deterioration of renal function, progression of septic shock, development of additional infections, and worsening of mental status."

   Hypoxic Respiratory Distress - likely secondary to pulmonary edema,
   however, although low likelihood, need to consider ?ARDS type picture
   evolving. Ground glass initially on CT scan suggesting viral or
   atypical infection. Wheezing on exam could be cardiac wheeze, possible
   underlying obstruction (carries asthma diagnosis since childhood). PE
   was also on differential
 LENI was negative.
   - continue atypical coverage as discussed below
   - nebs
   - wean O2
   - rate control to encourage forward flow; holding diuresis for now. ?
   add afterload reduction to encourage forward flow
   - consider CTA if renal failure stabilizes
   Acute Respiratory Acidosis - possibly due to rapid shallow breathing
   and increased dead space ventilation, although ?underlying obstructive
   disease
   Shock - c diff positive. Off pressors. Diffuse ground glass opacities
   on CT scan, cultures pending. Broadly covered at this point for severe
   CAP, atypicals, and cdiff.

   - check central venous O2 sat, lactate
 use CvO2 sat to guide volume
   management
   - pressures remain stable, however, fluid status is difficult to manage
   Afib with RVR - responding well to dilt gtt at low dosing - transition
   to oral meds today without metoprolol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension, fevers, and agitation. She was admitted with hypoxia, hypotension, fevers, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, along with complicated volume status. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea, pulmonary edema, and agitation. She is currently on several medications including diltiazem, lasix, morphine, ativan, and others. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 36°C, heart rate 71 bpm, blood pressure 91/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. The patient has been given 250cc of fluid and has a urine output of 1,750 mL. Her CVP is 11 mmHg and she has received a total of 2,045 mL of IV fluids. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has tested positive for C. difficile. Imaging shows diffuse ground glass opacities on CT scan, suggesting viral or atypical infection. The patient's assessment includes hypoxic respiratory distress, acute respiratory acidosis, shock, acute renal failure, anemia, and mental status change. The plan includes continuing atypical coverage, nebs, weaning O2, rate control, holding diuresis, considering CTA if renal failure stabilizes, and monitoring cultures."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now working to breath on high flow mask with
   bilateral diffuse crackles.  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement
   since her recent hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.
   No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on
   VBG.  Pulmonary edema likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has
   moderate aortic stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**]
   lung disease, ARDS secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause- will aggressively diurese with lasix and
   diuril
   - sputum cx if possible
   - Echo to reassess valves
   - cards consult
   - non-invasive ventilation if cardiogenic pulmonary edema
   - nebulizers PRN
   Hypotension:  Improving although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been
   off pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does
   not explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Will
   recheck ScVO2 for fluid management.  Random cortisol of 24.6 argues
   against adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c vancomycin, meropenem
   - continue azithromycin for atypical PNA coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - s/p 2 units of pRBCs yesterday to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements [**Hospital1 7**]
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - Ativan PRN
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled at 70s-90s on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - continue digoxin, f/u digoxin levels in AM given RF
   - off metoprolol
   - restarted dilt drip after PO did not control HR
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine trending up at 1.8 today.  Likely
   prerenal in the setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.
   ATN still remains in differential.
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes consistent with pre-renal, likely component of decreased
   forward flow
   - check urine sediment
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold diuretics
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She presented to the emergency room with respiratory distress and was found to be hypotensive in the 80s systolic. The patient has been receiving high-flow oxygen and is currently on a high-flow neb with SpO2 of 96%. She has diffuse bilateral crackles on lung examination. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 bpm and blood pressure of 87/43 mmHg. She is still oliguric with a urine output of 10-20cc/hr.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, hypotension, anemia, confusion, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, right lower extremity edema, and cerebrovascular disease. She has undergone several interventions including fluid boluses, transfusion of packed red blood cells, administration of captopril, lasix, and heparin. The patient's renal function is declining, as evidenced by an increasing creatinine level. Her mental status has been fluctuating, and she is disoriented. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema due to cardiogenic causes or ARDS secondary to sepsis.
2. Hypotension possibly due to septic shock or adrenal"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Septic Shock:  Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off pressors since 2
   PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not explain CT chest
   findings of ground glass opacities.    Will recheck ScVO2 today for
   fluid management.  Random cortisol of 24.6 argues against adrenal
   insufficiency.  At this time with hypotension, low grade fevers and
   tachycardia concern for sepsis although source is unclear.  History of
   [**Month/Year (2) **], rhinorrhea sore throat, and ground glass opacities suggesting of
   a viral upper respiratory tract infection for which influenza and PCP
   would be in the differential.   Other considerations include
   hypotension secondary to dehydration in the setting of viral illness
   and diuretic use.  Cardiogenic shock is unlikely given lack of cardiac
   symptoms and normal EKG.  Currently with mildly decreased urine ouput,
   normal lactate, mild acute renal failure and confusion but unresponsive
   to fluid challenge.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and later diagnosed with septic shock. The etiology of sepsis is unclear, but the patient has been positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and shows signs of ground glass opacities on chest CT, suggesting a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Other considerations include dehydration and diuretic use.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, anemia, confusion, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and diastolic heart failure. She has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, anticoagulants, diuretics, and transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, exacerbation of heart failure, and potential bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, urine output, renal function, and mental status. Additionally, the patient's fluid management will be based on central venous O2 sats."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and hypotension.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities, pulmonary
   edema.  Less likely atypical pneumonia.  Plan continue supplimental
   oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic, but may be non-cardiogenic (ARDS).
   Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan continue to treat as outlined,
   intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Check
   echo to assess Aortic Valve (near critial on most recent) and LV
   function.  Cardiology to assess.
   SEPSIS -- initial response to resussitation.  Continue antimicrobials,
   including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion.  Monitor.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
    ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with respiratory distress, hypotension, and diffuse ground glass opacities on imaging. She is critically ill and has multiple medical conditions including sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure. The patient is on various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and sedatives. She has a history of aortic stenosis and previous admissions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and diffuse ground glass opacities suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. This can be due to pulmonary edema or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and signs of cardiac decompensation raise concerns for cardiogenic shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac function is essential.
3. Infection: The presence of sepsis indicates an ongoing infection. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters (e.g., white blood cell count, C-reactive protein), and clinical symptoms is necessary to monitor the infection's progression and response to treatment.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may be due to prerenal azotemia or intrinsic renal damage. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolyte levels, and renal function tests is important.
5. Bleeding risk: The patient's use of anticoag"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and hypotension.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities, pulmonary
   edema.  Less likely atypical pneumonia.  Plan continue supplimental
   oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic, but may be non-cardiogenic (ARDS).
   Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan continue to treat as outlined,
   intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Check
   echo to assess Aortic Valve (near critial on most recent) and LV
   function.  Cardiology to assess.
   SEPSIS -- initial response to resussitation.  Continue antimicrobials,
   including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion.  Monitor.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
    ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory distress, hypotension, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. She has a history of aortic stenosis and is currently experiencing congestive heart failure, sepsis, and acute renal failure. The patient is also anemic and has confusion. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and blood pressure control medications. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently admitted to the ICU with a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggest the possibility of worsening respiratory function. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support measures may be necessary.
2. Cardiac decompensation: The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) and aortic stenosis indicate that there is a risk of further cardiac deterioration. Regular monitoring of cardiac function and potential interventions such as diuretics or cardiac catheterization may be needed.
3. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis needs to be closely monitored for any signs of worsening infection or organ dysfunction. Prompt identification and treatment of infection sources are crucial.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure could progress to more severe kidney dysfunction. Regular assessment of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid balance and medication adjustments, should be considered.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's use"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory distress and hypotension. The patient's primary issues include hypoxemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, congestive heart failure (CHF), sepsis, and hypertension. There are also concerns for confusion, acute renal failure, and Clostridium difficile enterocolitis.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The presence of diffuse ground glass opacities and pulmonary edema may indicate the development of ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and potentially require mechanical ventilation.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of CHF and the presence of atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which can result in inadequate organ perfusion and contribute to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

3. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension and altered mental status suggests sepsis. If not appropriately managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ failure.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment. In the setting of sepsis and hypotension, there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury.

5. Clostridium difficile Enterocolitis: The patient is receiving Flagyl for this condition. If not effectively treated, it can lead to"

   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
   functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 12 mmHg) due to mitral
   annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
   may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
   is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-6-23**], the
   degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving bibasalar
   crackles.  She diuresed well with lasix drip overnight and was -800 cc
   this AM.  Echo basically unchanged from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of
   valvular disease which suggests her pulmonary edema was prompted by her
   tachycardia on admission.  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement
   since her recent hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.
   No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on
   ABG.  Pulmonary edema likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has
   moderate aortic stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**]
   lung disease, ARDS secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to aggressively diurese
   with lasix drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c vancomycin, meropenem
   - last day of azithromycin today (total 4 days) for atypical PNA
   coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - s/p 2 units of pRBCs [**8-31**] to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements [**Hospital1 7**]
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - Ativan PRN
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled at 70s-90s on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - d/c digoxin yesterday given renal failure
   - off metoprolol
   - Will transition from dilt drip to po dilt starting with 30mg QID
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine trending up.  Likely prerenal in the
   setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.  ATN still remains
   in differential.  Diuresing with lasix drip despite renal failure to
   treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.  Will continue
   diuresis until UOP decreased/not responding or hypotensive.
   - check pm lytes
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes consistent with pre-renal, likely component of decreased
   forward flow
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix and start full dose aspirin
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She presented to the emergency room with hypotension and respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including moderate aortic stenosis, severe mitral annular calcification, moderate functional mitral stenosis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She also has iron deficiency anemia, confusion, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on various medications and is being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: The patient's moderate aortic stenosis and severe mitral annular calcification may lead to impaired cardiac function and subsequent pulmonary edema.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bibasilar crackles suggest possible respiratory failure, which could be due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or other causes such as pneumonia or ARDS.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive C. difficile test and recent hospitalization increase the risk of developing sepsis, particularly if she develops a secondary infection.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if her renal function does not improve, leading to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Stroke: Given the patient's history of stroke and atrial fibr"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving bibasalar
   crackles.  She diuresed well with lasix drip overnight and was -800 cc
   this AM.  Echo basically unchanged from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of
   valvular disease- unclear why she has pulmonary edema now.  Patient
   with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent hospitalization
   despite no known primary lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary
   embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on ABG.  Pulmonary edema
   likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic
   stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS
   secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to aggressively diurese
   with lasix drip until Creatinine> 2.5
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c vancomycin, meropenem
   - continue azithromycin for atypical PNA coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - s/p 2 units of pRBCs [**8-31**] to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements [**Hospital1 7**]
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - Ativan PRN
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled at 70s-90s on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - d/c digoxin yesterday given renal failure
   - off metoprolol
   - on dilt drip with good rate control after PO did not control HR
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine trending up.  Likely prerenal in the
   setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.  ATN still remains
   in differential.  Diuresing with lasix drip despite renal failure to
   treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.  Will continue
   diuresis until Cr 2.5.
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes consistent with pre-renal, likely component of decreased
   forward flow
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, atrial fibrillation, and recent hospitalization. She presented to the emergency room with hypotension, which resolved but the etiology is unclear. The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, hypotension, anemia, confusion, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, right lower extremity edema, and cerebrovascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has moderate aortic stenosis and severe mitral annular calcification with moderate functional mitral stenosis. These conditions can lead to increased pressure in the left atrium and subsequent pulmonary edema.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending up, indicating declining renal function. This may be due to septic shock, pre-renal causes, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction. This can result in decreased cardiac output and symptoms of heart failure.
4. Cerebrovascular disease: The patient had an occipital stroke in the past, which was thought to be secondary to cardioembolic disease. She is on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further cerebrovascular events.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, atrial fibrillation, and moderate aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. She has been receiving high flow oxygen and diuretics for pulmonary edema. Her current condition shows improvement in hypotension but ongoing respiratory distress. She also has known iron deficiency anemia, confusion, acute renal failure, and a history of cerebrovascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and diffuse bilateral crackles suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix and diuril has been initiated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension improved but the etiology is unclear. Pressors have been discontinued since 2 PM on 08-30. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection has been ruled out as a cause.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending up at 1.8, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to prerenal causes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring urine output and creatinine levels will help guide management.
4. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. Echocardiogram shows a preserved e"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities, pulmonary
   edema.  Less likely atypical pneumonia.  Plan continue supplimental
   oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic, (but may be component of
   non-cardiogenic, ARDS).  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan continue to
   treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion. Tachycardia may have
   contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.  Hope to transition to PO
   diltiazem.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
    ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient's condition has improved slightly since yesterday, with less dyspnea and better tolerance of lasix infusion. The patient remains somnolent and delirious. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and aortic stenosis. The patient's current medications include diltiazem, furosemide, morphine sulfate, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3 C, heart rate 74 bpm, blood pressure 115/45 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's current assessment includes hypoxemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, congestive heart failure, sepsis, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, aortic stenosis, Clostridium difficile enterocolitis, anemia, and confusion. The plan includes continuing supplemental oxygen, considering non-invasive ventilation, treating pulmonary edema, assessing cardiac decompensation, continuing antim"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities, pulmonary
   edema.  Less likely atypical pneumonia.  Plan continue supplimental
   oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic, (but may be component of
   non-cardiogenic, ARDS).  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan continue to
   treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion. Tachycardia may have
   contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.  Hope to transition to PO
   diltiazem.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
    ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress and sepsis. The patient is an 86-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). 

The patient has several medical complications, including:
1. HYPOXEMIA: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood, which is attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities and pulmonary edema. Non-invasive ventilation may be considered to supplement oxygen.

2. DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES: These are attributed to pulmonary edema primarily, presumed to be cardiogenic, but may also be a component of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The treatment plan focuses on managing cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

3. CHF: The patient has concerns for cardiac decompensation in the setting of sepsis. An echocardiogram shows worsening aortic stenosis (near critical on most recent) and left ventricular function. Cardiology should assess the patient.

4. SEPSIS: The patient's sepsis is attributed to C. diff and has responded to resuscitation. Antimicrobials, including Flagyl, should be continued.

5. HYPOTENSION: The patient previously required levophed but is now off. Blood pressure monitoring is recommended to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

6. A-FIB: The patient has atrial fibrillation with good"

   No new CXR
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving bibasalar
   crackles.  She diuresed well with lasix drip overnight and was -800 cc
   this AM.  Echo basically unchanged from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of
   valvular disease which suggests her pulmonary edema was prompted by her
   tachycardia on admission.  Patient with persistent oxygen requirement
   since her recent hospitalization despite no known primary lung disease.
   No evidence of pulmonary embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on
   ABG.  Pulmonary edema likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has
   moderate aortic stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**]
   lung disease, ARDS secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to aggressively diurese
   with lasix drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - d/c vancomycin, meropenem
   - last day of azithromycin today (total 4 days) for atypical PNA
   coverage
   - follow blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   C. diff: Continue po vanc, day 4 today
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - s/p 2 units of pRBCs [**8-31**] to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements [**Hospital1 7**]
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - Ativan PRN
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled at 70s-90s on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - d/c digoxin yesterday given renal failure
   - off metoprolol
   - Will transition from dilt drip to po dilt starting with 30mg QID
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine trending up.  Likely prerenal in the
   setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.  ATN still remains
   in differential.  Diuresing with lasix drip despite renal failure to
   treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.  Will continue
   diuresis until UOP decreased/not responding or hypotensive.
   - check pm lytes
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes consistent with pre-renal, likely component of decreased
   forward flow
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix and start full dose aspirin
   - continue high dose statin

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving lung exam.
   She diuresed well with lasix drip overnight.  Echo basically unchanged
   from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of valvular disease which suggests her
   pulmonary edema was prompted by her tachycardia on admission.  Patient
   with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent hospitalization
   despite no known primary lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary
   embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on ABG.  Pulmonary edema
   likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic
   stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS
   secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to diurese with lasix
   drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - goal -1L today
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   RUQ pain: Pt groaned on palpation of RUQ today.  Will check LFTs and
   get KUB to eval for toxic megacolon in setting of C diff with low stool
   output.
   -f/u LFTs
   -f/u KUB read
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - s/p azithromycin (total 4 days) for atypical PNA coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   C. diff: Continue po vanc, day [**4-22**]
   - continue po vanc for 14 days
   - checking KUB for possible megacolon given RUQ pain and low stool
   output
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine down to 1.9 from 2.1 yesterday
   afternoon.  Likely prerenal in the setting of what appears to be septic
   shock, low UOP.  ATN still remains in differential.  Diuresing with
   lasix drip despite renal failure to treat pulmonary edema and improve
   lung function.  Will continue diuresis until UOP decreased/not
   responding or hypotensive.
   - check pm lytes
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes consistent with pre-renal, likely component of decreased
   forward flow
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - s/p 2 units of pRBCs [**8-31**] to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements daily (want to avoid constipating effects)
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - Ativan PRN
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   - if concern for hypercarbia with worsening altered mental status,
   consider BIPAP
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - d/c digoxin yesterday given renal failure
   - off metoprolol
   - responding to po dilt (30mg QID)
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix and start full dose aspirin
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

   maximize nutrition

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She presented with hypotension and respiratory distress, which has been improving with high-flow mask oxygen and diuresis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 114/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and her CVP is 11 mmHg. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, diltiazem, heparin sodium, famotidine, and morphine sulfate. 

Her laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and lactic acid, along with low potassium and magnesium levels. Her blood glucose is within normal range. 

The patient's imaging shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism or hypercarbia. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is improving on high-flow mask oxygen.
2. Hypotension: Resolved, but the etiology is unclear. 
3. C. difficile (C. diff): The patient is positive for C. diff and will continue on vancomycin for 14 days.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities --> pulmonary
   edema.  Less likely atypical pneumonia.  Plan continue supplimental
   oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation, treat pulmonary edema.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic, (but may be component of
   non-cardiogenic, ARDS).  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan continue to
   treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   RUQ TENDERNESS -- would check LFTs, amylase, lipase.  Consider RUQ US
   if LFTs abnormal.  Check KUB to assess bowel diameter (assess for toxic
   megacolon).
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   MENTAL STATUS -- unclear, but possibly related to reversed sleep-wake
   cycle.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion --> now on PO.
   Tachycardia may have contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.  Slowly improving.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient's main concerns include hypoxemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, right upper quadrant tenderness, congestive heart failure (CHF), altered mental status, hypotension, atrial fibrillation (A-fib), renal failure, aortic stenosis, C. diff enterocolitis, anemia, confusion, acute renal failure, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Diffuse Pulmonary Infiltrates: These infiltrates suggest pulmonary edema, which can be caused by cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic factors. If cardiogenic, it may indicate worsening heart failure. If non-cardiogenic, it could be associated with ARDS.

3. Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) Tenderness: This tenderness could be indicative of liver problems such as hepatitis or cholecystitis. Further evaluation through laboratory tests and possibly a RUQ ultrasound is needed.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms, including pulmonary edema and hypoxemia, suggest possible CHF. Cardiac decompensation can worsen the patient's condition and lead to additional complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to diffuse ground glass opacities --> pulmonary
   edema.  Less likely atypical pneumonia.  Plan continue supplimental
   oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation, treat pulmonary edema.
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic, (but may be component of
   non-cardiogenic, ARDS).  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan continue to
   treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   RUQ TENDERNESS -- would check LFTs, amylase, lipase.  Consider RUQ US
   if LFTs abnormal.  Check KUB to assess bowel diameter (assess for toxic
   megacolon).
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   MENTAL STATUS -- unclear, but possibly related to reversed sleep-wake
   cycle.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion --> now on PO.
   Tachycardia may have contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.  Slowly improving.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis. She has diffuse ground glass opacities on imaging, indicating pulmonary edema. The primary cause of the pulmonary edema is presumed to be cardiogenic, but there may also be a component of non-cardiogenic ARDS. The patient's right upper quadrant tenderness raises concerns for possible liver involvement, such as toxic megacolon or cholecystitis. An echocardiogram shows worsening aortic stenosis and left ventricular function, and cardiology consultation is recommended. The patient's mental status is unclear but may be related to a reversed sleep-wake cycle. She has responded to resuscitation for sepsis, which is attributed to C. diff. Antimicrobials, including Flagyl, should be continued. Hypotension was previously treated with levophed but is now off, with acceptable blood pressure and MAP. Renal failure is acute and likely attributed to hypotensive insult in the setting of sepsis. It is slowly improving, with monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine. The patient has subcritical aortic stenosis, and a repeat echo is recommended. C. diff enterocolitis should be treated with continued Flagyl. Anemia has improved with PRBC transfusion and improved cardiac function. Confusion may be attributed to acute illness or previous occipital strokes. Acute renal failure is evidence of pre"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Day/Year **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving lung exam.
   She diuresed well with lasix drip yesterday.  Echo basically unchanged
   from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of valvular disease which suggests her
   pulmonary edema was prompted by her tachycardia on admission.  Patient
   with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent hospitalization
   despite no known primary lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary
   embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on ABG.  Pulmonary edema
   likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic
   stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS
   secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to diurese with lasix
   drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - goal -1L today
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   RUQ pain: Resolved with nml LFTs and nml KUB.
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - s/p azithromycin (total 4 days) for atypical PNA coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   C. diff: Continue po vanc, day [**5-22**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory distress. 

The patient's respiratory distress has improved with high flow mask oxygenation. Her diuresis was successful with lasix yesterday, but her echo did not show any progression of valvular disease. The patient's pulmonary edema is likely due to cardiogenic causes, possibly related to her moderate aortic stenosis. Other potential causes such as PCP, lung disease, or ARDS secondary to sepsis are still considered.

The patient's hypotension resolved, but the underlying cause is unclear. She tested positive for C. diff, but it does not explain the ground glass opacities seen on her CT chest. Her cortisol level argues against adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's acute renal failure is improving, likely due to prerenal causes in the setting of septic shock and low urine output. ATN remains in the differential, and the patient is being diuresed with lasix despite renal failure to treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.

The patient has known iron deficiency anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 30. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells to improve hypotension and anemia. 

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she is currently exhibiting delir"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Day/Year **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving lung exam.
   She diuresed well with lasix drip overnight.  Echo basically unchanged
   from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of valvular disease which suggests her
   pulmonary edema was prompted by her tachycardia on admission.  Patient
   with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent hospitalization
   despite no known primary lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary
   embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on ABG.  Pulmonary edema
   likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic
   stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS
   secondary to sepsis.

   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - s/p azithromycin (total 4 days) for atypical PNA coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible

   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine down to 1.9 from 2.1 yesterday
   afternoon.  Likely prerenal in the setting of what appears to be septic
   shock, low UOP.  ATN still remains in differential.  Diuresing with
   lasix drip despite renal failure to treat pulmonary edema and improve
   lung function.  Will continue diuresis until UOP decreased/not
   responding or hypotensive.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory distress. Her current condition includes ongoing oxygen requirement, mild bibasilar crackles, diffuse end expiratory wheezes, tachycardia, and right lower extremity edema. The patient's lab results show anemia, elevated lactate levels, and renal dysfunction. She has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, C. diff infection, and is suspected to have pulmonary edema due to cardiogenic causes. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she is confused. She has a known iron deficiency anemia and a history of cerebrovascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and bibasilar crackles indicate the possibility of pulmonary edema. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction. Pre-renal azotemia is likely due to septic shock and low urine output. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine is required.
3. Confusion/Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and disorientation suggest delirium. Factors such as optimizing sleep-wake cycle, limiting medications affecting mental status, and frequent orientation should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed ato pulmonary edema.  Plan continue
   supplimental oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation, treat pulmonary
   edema (net diurese).
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic.  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan
   continue to treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema.
   RUQ TENDERNESS -- would check LFTs, amylase, lipase.  Consider RUQ US
   if LFTs abnormal.  Check KUB to assess bowel diameter (assess for toxic
   megacolon).
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   MENTAL STATUS -- unclear, but possibly related to reversed sleep-wake
   cycle.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion --> now on PO.
   Tachycardia may have contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.  Slowly improving.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis, which may be attributed to pulmonary edema. This condition is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing and reduced oxygen levels.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's symptoms, such as hypotension and signs of poor cardiac output, suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock. This occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, potentially due to aortic stenosis or other cardiac issues.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury, which could be related to hypotensive insult during sepsis. Close monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels is necessary.

4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a subcritical aortic stenosis, which may contribute to compromised forward flow and contribute to the patient's poor cardiac function. Further evaluation with echocardiogram is recommended.

5. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. Treatment with Flagyl should be continued to manage the infection.

6. Anemia: The patient's anemia has improved with packed red blood cell transfusion,"

   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on 40% high flow mask with improving lung
   exam.  She diuresed well with lasix drip yesterday, discontinued
   overnight, restarted this morning.  Pulmonary edema likely due to
   cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic stenosis.  Also on
   differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS secondary to
   sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to diurese with lasix
   drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - goal -1L today
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   - trial of shovel mask today
   - repeat CXR
   RUQ pain: Resolved with nml LFTs and nml KUB.
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - s/p azithromycin (total 4 days) for atypical PNA coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   C. diff: Continue po vanc, day [**6-22**]
   - continue po vanc for 14 days
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improving, 1.1 today.  Likely prerenal
   in the setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.  ATN still
   remains in differential.  Will continue diuresis until UOP
   decreased/not responding or hypotensive.
   - check pm lytes
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements daily (want to avoid constipating effects)
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue zyprexa
   - increase olanzapine to 5mg
   - Ativan PRN via NG
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   - if concern for hypercarbia with worsening altered mental status,
   consider BIPAP
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - hold metoprolol
   - responding to po dilt 30mg QID
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix and start full dose aspirin
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation. She presents with several medical complications including pulmonary edema, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, hypoxemia, and acute renal failure.

Pulmonary edema is likely due to cardiogenic causes, possibly secondary to moderate aortic stenosis. The patient has been diuresed with lasix and the goal is to continue diuresis until urine output does not respond or the patient becomes hypotensive. 

C. difficile infection has been confirmed, but it does not explain the CT chest findings of ground glass opacities. 

The patient's altered mental status is consistent with delirium, with primary disorientation and a non-focal neurologic exam. This is likely secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon, as the patient has known occipital infarctions.

Acute renal failure is improving, with a current creatinine level of 1.1. It is likely prerenal in nature, possibly due to septic shock and low urine output. 

Other medical issues include iron deficiency anemia, atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, right lower extremity edema (without DVT), cerebrovascular disease (s/p occipital stroke), and replete electrolytes.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently receiving ICU"

   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on high flow mask with improving lung exam.
   She diuresed well with lasix drip yesterday.  Echo basically unchanged
   from [**Month (only) 807**] without progression of valvular disease which suggests her
   pulmonary edema was prompted by her tachycardia on admission.  Patient
   with persistent oxygen requirement since her recent hospitalization
   despite no known primary lung disease. No evidence of pulmonary
   embolism on CTA.  No signs of hypercarbia on ABG.  Pulmonary edema
   likely due to cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic
   stenosis.  Also on differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS
   secondary to sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to diurese with lasix
   drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - goal -1L today
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   RUQ pain: Resolved with nml LFTs and nml KUB.
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - s/p azithromycin (total 4 days) for atypical PNA coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   C. diff: Continue po vanc, day [**5-22**]
   - continue po vanc for 14 days
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improving.  Likely prerenal in the
   setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.  ATN still remains
   in differential.  Diuresing with lasix drip despite renal failure to
   treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function.  Will continue
   diuresis until UOP decreased/not responding or hypotensive.
   - check pm lytes
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - urine lytes consistent with pre-renal, likely component of decreased
   forward flow
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - s/p 2 units of pRBCs [**8-31**] to improve hypotension and anemia
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements daily (want to avoid constipating effects)
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue home zyprexa and sertraline
   - Ativan PRN via NG
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   - if concern for hypercarbia with worsening altered mental status,
   consider BIPAP
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - d/c digoxin yesterday given renal failure
   - off metoprolol
   - responding to po dilt (30mg QID)
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix and start full dose aspirin
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, respiratory distress, and suspected pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has improved with diuresis and oxygen therapy. However, she continues to require high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's initial presentation was consistent with pulmonary edema, which is likely caused by cardiogenic factors due to moderate aortic stenosis. Continuous diuresis with Lasix drip is being administered to manage this condition.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile, which could explain her recent gastrointestinal symptoms. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is being continued for a total of 14 days.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, suggesting improvement in renal function. However, prerenal azotemia remains a concern due to low urine output. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia, and her hematocrit has decreased further. Two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) have been transfused to improve her hypotension and anemia.
5. Confusion/Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits fluctuating mental status, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with acute pulmonary edema and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed ato pulmonary edema.  Plan continue
   supplimental oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation, treat pulmonary
   edema (net diurese).
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic.  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan
   continue to treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema.
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   MENTAL STATUS -- Somewhat improve.  Possibly related to reversed
   sleep-wake cycle.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion --> now on PO.
   Tachycardia may have contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.  Now creatinine at baseline, with good response to
   lasix.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 Continue TF.  Speech and swallow evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with respiratory failure, experiencing pulmonary edema and sepsis caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She has a history of aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's mental status has improved somewhat, possibly due to the reversal of her sleep-wake cycle. She is currently on supplemental oxygen and receiving treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics. Her blood pressure is stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as hypotension, acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory failure and pulmonary edema can lead to inadequate oxygenation, resulting in hypoxemia.
2. Diffuse Pulmonary Infiltrates: The pulmonary edema primarily caused by cardiogenic factors may progress to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, compromising lung function.
3. Cardiac Decompensation: The patient's worsening aortic stenosis and LV function indicate a high risk for cardiac decompensation, leading to further deterioration in cardiac output.
4. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis has responded to resuscitation, continued monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent relapse.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's hypotensive insult during sepsis may have caused"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F with hypoxic respiratory distress and sepsis (C. diff).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed ato pulmonary edema.  Plan continue
   supplimental oxygen, consider non-invasive ventilation, treat pulmonary
   edema (net diurese).
   DIFFUSE PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to pulmonary edema
   primarily, presumed cardiogenic.  Doubt pneumonia (atypical).  Plan
   continue to treat as outlined, intially focus on cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema.
   CHF -- concern for cardiac decompensation in setting of sepsis.  Echo
   demonstrates perhaps worsening of Aortic stenosis (near critial on most
   recent) and LV function.  Cardiology to assess.
   MENTAL STATUS -- Somewhat improve.  Possibly related to reversed
   sleep-wake cycle.
   SEPSIS -- Attributed to C. diff.  Responsed to resussitation.  Continue
   antimicrobials, including Flagyl.
   HYPOTENSION -- previously required levophed - remains off.  BP MAP
   acceptable.  Monitor.  Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   A-FIB -- good rate control on Diltiazem infusion --> now on PO.
   Tachycardia may have contributed to pulmonary edema.   Monitor.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, likely attributed to hypotensive insult in
   setting of sepsis.  Now creatinine at baseline, with good response to
   lasix.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 subcritical .  [**Month (only) 51**] be contributing to poor or
   compromised forward flow.  Repeat echo.
   C. DIFF ENTEROCOLITIS -- continue Flagyl.
   ANEMIA -- improved with PRBC transfusion.  Improved cardiac function as
   estimated by SvO2.
   CONFUSION --  attributed on last admission to occipital strokes, could
   be worse in the setting of acute illness
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for prerenal azotemia, concern this
   represents poor or limited forward cardiac flow.   Would check cardiac
   echo to assess LV function.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress and pulmonary edema, which indicates respiratory failure. The plan includes continuing supplemental oxygen and considering non-invasive ventilation to support breathing.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis attributed to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The plan involves continuing antimicrobials, including Flagyl, to treat the infection.

3. Cardiac decompensation: There is concern for cardiac decompensation due to worsening aortic stenosis and left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiology assessment is recommended to further evaluate the cardiac condition.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely attributed to hypotensive insult during sepsis. Monitoring urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels is advised to assess kidney function.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia that improved with packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. This may be related to ongoing bleeding or blood loss.

6. Confusion: The patient's confusion may be attributed to occipital strokes or acute illness. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

7. Acute renal failure: There is evidence of prerenal azotemia, and poor or limited forward cardiac flow may be contributing to acute renal failure. A cardiac echo is suggested to"

   - continue iron supplements daily (want to avoid constipating effects)
   .
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue zyprexa
   - continue olanzapine to 5mg
   - Ativan PRN via NG; morphine 0.5mg IV also works to calm pt down
   although now that respiratory status is improved, may not be as
   effective.
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - hold metoprolol
   - Continue diltiazem 30mg PO QID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to cough and found to be hypotensive. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with respiratory distress, but it has improved with the use of non-invasive ventilation (NC). It is likely secondary to pulmonary edema, which was confirmed by the chest X-ray (CXR).

2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, but the cause is unclear. It resolved with medical intervention, and the blood pressure has remained stable.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has an ongoing C. diff infection, for which she is receiving oral vancomycin.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, suggesting prerenal failure, possibly due to septic shock and low urine output. The possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is still in the differential diagnosis.

5. Anemia: The patient has known iron deficiency anemia, and her hematocrit level has increased, indicating hemoconcentration after aggressive diuresis. There are no active sites of bleeding, and the patient is being monitored closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with
   memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presents from home with
   [**Month/Year (2) **] for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive to the
   80s sysotlic non-responsive to fluid challenge.
   Respiratory Distress:  Now on 40% high flow mask with improving lung
   exam.  She diuresed well with lasix drip yesterday, discontinued
   overnight, restarted this morning.  Pulmonary edema likely due to
   cardiogenic causes as patient has moderate aortic stenosis.  Also on
   differential is PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 9614**] lung disease, ARDS secondary to
   sepsis.
   - suspect cardiogenic cause and will continue to diurese with lasix
   drip until UOP does not respond or she becomes hypotensive
   - goal -1L today
   - sputum cx if possible
   - nebulizers PRN
   - trial of shovel mask today
   - repeat CXR
   RUQ pain: Resolved with nml LFTs and nml KUB.
   Hypotension:  Resolved although etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been off
   pressors since 2 PM [**8-30**].  C. diff found to be positive, but does not
   explain CT chest findings of ground glass opacities.    Random cortisol
   of 24.6 argues against adrenal insufficiency.
   - s/p azithromycin (total 4 days) for atypical PNA coverage
   - f/u blood cultures
   - CVP goal [**7-18**], manage IVF using central venous O2 sat
   - influenza negative
   - given the occasional [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] send for a sputum culture if
   possible
   C. diff: Continue po vanc, day [**6-22**]
   - continue po vanc for 14 days
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine improving, 1.1 today.  Likely prerenal
   in the setting of what appears to be septic shock, low UOP.  ATN still
   remains in differential.  Will continue diuresis until UOP
   decreased/not responding or hypotensive.
   - check pm lytes
   - monitor urine ouput and creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   Anemia:  Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit 30.  No
   active sites of bleeding.  Guaiac negative.
   - trend hematocrit
   - continue iron supplements daily (want to avoid constipating effects)
   Confusion:  Patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status at home.
   Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of
   disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam.  Patient with known
   occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic
   phenomenon.
   - continue zyprexa
   - increase olanzapine to 5mg
   - Ativan PRN via NG
   - monitor mental status
   - frequent orientation
   - optimize sleep wake cycle
   - limit medications that affect mental status as much as possible
   - if concern for hypercarbia with worsening altered mental status,
   consider BIPAP
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation,
   controlled on dilt.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - hold metoprolol
   - responding to po dilt 30mg QID
   Diastolic Heart Failure: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic
   diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her
   response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of
   hypotension.  Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction.  She is
   on bumetanide as an outpatient.
   - hold metoprolol
   Right lower extremity edema:  No DVT shown on ultrasound
   Cerebrovascular Disease:  s/p occipital stroke in [**2200-6-9**] thought to
   be secondary to cardioembolic disease.
   - continue plavix and start full dose aspirin
   - continue high dose statin
   - monitor neurologic exam

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/39 mmHg to 117/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 4L NC.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild bibasilar crackles and diffuse end expiratory wheezes in the lungs, tachycardia, and a II/VI heart murmur at the apex. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding, and no organomegaly. The extremities show warm, well-perfused pulses with 1+ edema in the right lower extremity.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.6 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. The blood culture is negative.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema, likely caused by cardiogenic factors, as"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of occipital stroke, memory difficulties, and atrial fibrillation. She presented to the emergency room with cough and was found to be hypotensive. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress, likely due to pulmonary edema, and her hypotension has resolved. She is currently on noninvasive ventilation and diuresis. The patient also has a known case of iron deficiency anemia, confusion or delirium, and atrial fibrillation. She has been treated for C. difficile, acute renal failure, and diastolic heart failure. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she requires close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and the use of noninvasive ventilation put her at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and systemic anticoagulation.
3. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and disorientation indicate delirium. It is important to optimize her sleep-wake cycle, limit medications affecting mental status, and provide frequent orientation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable but still require close monitoring. Renal dosing of medications and checking electrolytes daily are necessary.
5. Bleeding: The patient is on systemic anticoag"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with acute pulmonary edema and sepsis due to C. diff infection. She was agitated last night and received olanzapine. The patient achieved a negative 2L fluid goal. She has a history of allergies to penicillins and shellfish, and her last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 04:03 PM. The patient is currently receiving furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hour, along with other ICU medications including morphine sulfate, famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/32 mmHg to 117/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Her weight is currently 56.5 kg, and her height is 65 inches. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg, and she has received a total of 1,786 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 1,114 mL through the urinary catheter. Blood products totaling 3,935 mL have been transfused, and the patient has had negative balances in terms of fluid and electrolyte levels.

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///36/. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, crackles in the chest, trace lower extremity edema, and soft and non-tender abdomen. Neurologic assessment is not available due to the patient's altered mental status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.0 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hgb) of 11.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L, and normal potassium (K+) level of 4.0 mEq/L. Other lab values include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated troponin-T, and elevated liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray, but no significant findings were mentioned. Microbiology results show negative blood cultures.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current conditions include pulmonary edema, C. diff infection, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hypoxemia, and alteration in nutrition. The patient responded well to diuresis and is now experiencing contraction"
