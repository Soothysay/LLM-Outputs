   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]F with h/o afib, breast CA, and hypothyroidism was admitted
   following a mechanical fall and found to be in rapid atrial fib. She
   was subsequently found to have a high grade S. Aureus bacteremia,
   presumably secondary to endocarditis. She is transferred to the MICU
   secondary to increased respiratory distress.
   .
   1. Respiratory distress
   Review of flow sheet suggests that O2 requirement has been more
   progressive in nature than abrupt in onset. In the setting of weight
   gain with net positive I/O, suspect that pulmonary edema may be
   contributory. On the other hand her CXR shows asymmetric opacification
   of the right hemithorax less classic  for edema - potentially worrisome
   for a pneumonia or mucus plugging for example. Evidence for pna
   otherwise not very compelling without cough, sputum, or fever. In the
   setting of suspected endocarditis, septic pulmonary emboli are a
   concern as well. Think ACS or (non-septic) PE less likely. Rapid afib
   could be contributing to SOB in additionl.
   - Trial of diuresis goal -1 to 2L negative today as BP tolerates,
   strict I/O, daily weight. Check PM lytes
   - Will add empiric levofloxacin and flagyl for possible ?aspiration pna
   to patient's existing vanc and gent
   - Rate control afib as below
   - Nebs prn
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Rate very poorly controlled on the floor, though she initially
   responded to dilt drip in ED. Limited response to PO metoprolol, IV
   dilt boluses. PO med absorption might be lower in setting of gut edema.
   TSH WNL this admission. Volume overload and hyperadrenergic state may
   be contributory.
   - Restart dilt drip, DC metoprolol
   - Discuss with cards re ?amiodarone versus digoxin.
   - Given age and falling suspect she is not an appropriate candidate for
   anticoagulation, but will review medical history  further. Would also
   further discuss possibility of cardioversion with cards.
   .
   3. Staph aureus bacteremia
   Highly concerning for endocarditis, though no obvious vegetation seen
   on TTE.
   - Continue vancomycin and gentamicin per ID recommendations, following
   peaks and troughs.
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures til clears
   .
   4. Septic arthritis
   Orthopedics following, will need repeat shoulder aspiration if not
   improving in next 1-2 days per ortho; no imminent plans for washout.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol and breakthrough oxycodone
   .
   5. Hypertension
   Holding home amlodipine and lisinopril in setting of rapid afib.

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted following a mechanical fall and was found to have rapid atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, presumably secondary to endocarditis. She was transferred to the MICU due to increased respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen requirement has been progressively increasing, suggesting possible pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Considering her history of suspected endocarditis, septic pulmonary emboli are also a concern. Diuretics will be given to manage pulmonary edema, and empiric antibiotics will be added for possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's heart rate is poorly controlled on the floor and initially responded to diltiazem in the emergency department. Metoprolol absorption might be lower due to gut edema. Restarting diltiazem and discussing amiodarone versus digoxin with cardiology will be considered.
3. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: Endocarditis is highly suspected, although no obvious vegetation is seen on transthoracic echocardiography. Continuing vancomycin and gentamicin per ID recommendations and daily surveillance blood cultures until clear will be implemented.
4. Septic arthritis: Orthopedics will follow up"

   setting of suspected endocarditis, septic pulmonary emboli are a
   concern as well. Think ACS or (non-septic) PE less likely. Rapid afib
   could be contributing to SOB in additionl.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90+ year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism.
- She was admitted following a mechanical fall and was found to have rapid atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which is presumed to be secondary to endocarditis.
- She was transferred to the MICU due to increased respiratory distress.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress, which may be caused by pulmonary edema, pneumonia, mucus plugging, or septic pulmonary emboli. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
- She has been placed on a trial of diuresis to manage her respiratory symptoms and strict input/output monitoring is being implemented.
- Empiric levofloxacin and flagyl have been added to her medication regimen for possible aspiration pneumonia.
- Her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is poorly controlled despite previous treatments. Restarting a diltiazem drip and discussing amiodarone versus digoxin with the cardiology team are recommended.
- She continues to have Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, highly concerning for endocarditis, and will continue with vancomycin and gentamicin per ID recommendations.
- Orthopedics have been consulted regarding a possible septic arthritis in her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU following a mechanical fall and diagnosed with endocarditis. She has persistent bacteremia despite prolonged antibiotic treatment and has limited capacity to clear the bacteremia. The patient also has atrial fibrillation and requires pain management. She is currently on a PCA morphine sulfate infusion for pain control and has been given Dilt gtt for her atrial fibrillation. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is expected to stay in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's persistent bacteremia suggests ongoing insult with MSSA endocarditis. The main concern here is the risk of further complications such as heart valve damage, heart failure, or systemic infection.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is currently on Dilt gtt to control her heart rate. However, there is a possibility of developing more severe arrhythmias or congestive heart failure if the AFIB is not properly managed.
3. Pain Management: The patient requires both acute and chronic pain management. Improper pain control can lead to increased discomfort, agitation, and potentially worsen her overall condition.
4. Limited IV Access: The patient has limited IV access, which may hinder effective administration of antibiotics and other medications necessary for her treatment.
5. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control should be"

   following a mechanical fall and found to be in rapid atrial fib. She
   was subsequently found to have a high grade S. Aureus bacteremia,
   secondary to endocarditis. She was transferred to the MICU secondary to
   increased respiratory distress.

   #. Staph aureus bacteremia/ Endocarditis:  All blood cultures positive
   for methacillin sensitive staph aureus.  The patient is refusing PICC
   placement.  She would need to be treated for 6 weeks at least for
   endocarditis.  The palliative care team was consulted and the family is
   deciding whether to go down the route of treating with antibiotics for
   6 weeks with PICC placement or making the patient comfort measures

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted after a mechanical fall and found to have rapid atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia secondary to endocarditis. She was transferred to the MICU due to increased respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), Heart rate 107 bpm (85-130), Blood pressure 112/64 mmHg (92/40-125/64), Respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute (12-23), Oxygen saturation 93% on 6L NC.
- Physical examination reveals occasional wheezing in the lungs, tachycardia with irregular S1 and S2, soft systolic murmur at the apex, and bilateral lower extremity edema.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated creatinine, and slightly low magnesium and phosphate levels.
- The patient's blood cultures are positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
- She is refusing PICC placement and is unwilling to undergo daily surveillance cultures and all labs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted for a mechanical fall and found to have rapid atrial fibrillation. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, secondary to endocarditis. She is currently in respiratory distress and has been transferred to the MICU. The patient is refusing PICC placement and is considering comfort measures only. The family is deciding whether to treat with antibiotics for at least 6 weeks or opt for comfort measures only.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia/endocarditis: This is already present and requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics for an extended period. If left untreated or if treatment is inadequate, it can lead to further spread of the infection, septic emboli, heart failure, and potentially death.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which is likely secondary to endocarditis, septic emboli, and volume overload in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. If not managed appropriately, it can progress to acute respiratory failure and potentially death.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which has been partially controlled with diltiazem drip. However, there is a risk of uncontrolled RVR leading to cardi"
