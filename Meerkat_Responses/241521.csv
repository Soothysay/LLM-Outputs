   Assessment and Plan
   82M h/o HTN presents with >48 hours chest congestion, nausea found to
   have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary
   edema resulting in respiratory failure.
   .
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI. CKs appear to be close to peaked, but are still
   mildy uptrending. Echo with infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis. Plan
   for cath later on today.
   - Continue ASA, Beta-blocker, Plavix
   - Continue heparin IV gtt for medical management of NSTEMI
   - No integrillin given age and renal failure
   - Statin, check lipid panel in AM and follow LFTs given chronic
   transaminitis
   - Serial ECGs, [**Year (4 digits) 1174**] CEs to confirm declining
   - Consider cath in AM pending clinical course
   .
   PUMP: Acute decompensated CHF with newly depressed EF 35-40% with mild
   global HK on echo at OSH. Intubated for acute pulmonary edema at OSH
   and respiratory failure.
   - Beta-blocker
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - Echo in AM
   - I/O goal even overnight pending repeat labs
   - Attempt to wean vent and extubate
   .
   RHYTHM: Telemetry.
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated at OSH for dyspnea thought to be
   secondary to decompensated heart failure in setting of ACS. Also cannot
   r/o PNA/infiltrate given leukocytosis, fever. Patient
s FiO2 has been
   weaned down overnight, has been tolerating pressure support well
   - continue mild diuresis as above
   - continue to wean down on ventilatory support with goal to extubate
   - patient was switched overnight from propofol and fentanyl to
   versed/fentanyl
   .
   FEVER: [**Month (only) 11**] be stress reaction in setting of MI, however was complaining
   of URI type symptoms at office visit in addition to SOB. No
   leukocytosis at OSH. If is indication of infection, sources could be
   pulmonary (cough, unable to r/o infiltrate on CXR), abdominal with
   increased transaminitis.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now as source unclear
   - [**Name (NI) **] fever curve, WBC count
   - Send blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH (BCx, UCx)
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cre 1.5 increased from baseline 1.0 in setting of
   diuresis for acute pulmonary edema and transient hypotension at OSH,
   most likely consistent with prerenal/ATN etiology however consider
   cardiogenic component in setting of new depressed EF.
   - Urine lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - given mucomyst prior to cath
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Chronically elevated but higher than recent baseline,
   monitor daily in setting of initiating statin therapy. Also no
   abdominal pain, Tbili elevation to suggest acute cholangitis/process.
   Also acute hepatitis could be cause of increased elevation
   - [**Name (NI) 1174**] LFTs, abdominal exam
   - consider checking hepatitis serologies

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with chest congestion, nausea, and was found to have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. He has been receiving various medications including ASA, beta-blocker, Plavix, heparin IV gtt, and statin. The patient's condition has been monitored closely with serial ECGs, CEs to confirm declining trends, and an echo showing infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis. The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.5. The patient's liver function tests are also elevated, suggesting transaminitis. The patient has been on diuresis for acute pulmonary edema and has shown improvement in his respiratory status. However, he still requires ventilatory support and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fever may be due to a stress reaction or infection, with potential sources including the lungs or abdomen. Blood cultures have been sent, and antibiotics have been held for now. The patient's glycemic control and nutrition are being monitored, and prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's disposition is currently in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M h/o HTN presents with >48 hours chest congestion, nausea found to
   have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary
   edema resulting in respiratory failure.
   .
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI. No prior known history of CAD with normal
   stress-echo in [**2117**]. History and downtrending cardiac enzymes suggest
   event >48 hours prior. Echo at OSH reveals global HK without clear
   focal WMA and newly depressed EF. ECG with T wave inversions suspicious
   for apical ballooning, although unclear evaluation of degree of apical
   hypokinesis on OSH ECHO
   - ASA
   - Beta-blocker
   - Plavix 300, then 75 daily
   - Restart heparin IV gtt pending coags
   - No integrillin given with resolving ACS (enzymes trending down) and
   renal failure
   - Statin, check lipid panel in AM and follow LFTs given chronic
   transaminitis
   - Serial ECGs, [**Year (4 digits) 1174**] CEs to confirm declining
   - Consider cath in AM pending clinical course
   .
   PUMP: Acute decompensated CHF with newly depressed EF 35-40% with mild
   global HK on echo at OSH. Intubated for acute pulmonary edema at OSH
   and respiratory failure.
   - Beta-blocker
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - Echo in AM
   - I/O goal even overnight pending repeat labs
   - Attempt to wean vent and extubate
   .
   RHYTHM: Telemetry.
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated at OSH for dyspnea thought to be
   secondary to decompensated heart failure in setting of ACS. Also cannot
   r/o PNA/infiltrate given leukocytosis, fever. Patient
s FiO2 has been
   weaned down overnight, has been tolerating pressure support well
   - continue mild diuresis as above
   - continue to wean down on ventilatory support with goal to extubate
   - patient was switched overnight from propofol and fentanyl to
   versed/fentanyl
   .
   FEVER: [**Month (only) 11**] be stress reaction in setting of MI, however was complaining
   of URI type symptoms at office visit in addition to SOB. No
   leukocytosis at OSH. If is indication of infection, sources could be
   pulmonary (cough, unable to r/o infiltrate on CXR), abdominal with
   increased transaminitis.
   - Hold on antibiotics for now as source unclear
   - [**Name (NI) **] fever curve, WBC count
   - Send blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH (BCx, UCx)
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cre 1.5 increased from baseline 1.0 in setting of
   diuresis for acute pulmonary edema and transient hypotension at OSH,
   most likely consistent with prerenal/ATN etiology however consider
   cardiogenic component in setting of new depressed EF.
   - Urine lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - given mucomyst prior to cath
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Chronically elevated but higher than recent baseline,
   monitor daily in setting of initiating statin therapy. Also no
   abdominal pain, Tbili elevation to suggest acute cholangitis/process.
   Also acute hepatitis could be cause of increased elevation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with chest congestion and nausea. He was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) complicated by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:

1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of NSTEMI, indicating underlying CAD. There is no prior known history of CAD, but a stress-echo from last year showed normal results. However, cardiac enzymes suggest that the event occurred more than 48 hours prior. A recent echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis without clear focal wall motion abnormalities and a newly depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 35-40%. The ECG showed T wave inversions suspicious for apical ballooning, although the evaluation of the degree of apical hypokinesis on the OSH ECHO is unclear.

2. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF): The patient has acute decompensated CHF with a newly depressed EF of 35-40% and mild global hypokinesis on echo at OSH. He was intubated for acute pulmonary edema at OSH and respiratory failure.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to decompensated heart failure in the setting"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension presenting with chest congestion, nausea, and subsequent diagnosis of NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema. The patient has been intubated for acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by fever, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the presence of pulmonary edema, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock.
2. Severe sepsis or septic shock: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and potential sources of infection (pulmonary or abdominal) indicate the possibility of severe sepsis or septic shock.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The presence of worsening pulmonary edema and respiratory failure raises the possibility of ARDS.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of diuresis for acute pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of AKI, likely due to prerenal causes such as hypotension or cardiogenic shock.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The elevated transaminase levels may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which could be due to acute hepatitis or other causes.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M h/o HTN presents with >48 hours chest congestion, nausea found to
   have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary
   edema resulting in respiratory failure.
   .
   Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: ABG supports hypoxic resp failure. CXR
   supports worsening RLL pneumonia. Pneumonia diagnosis further supported
   by sputum GS findings, fever, CXR and leukocytosis. Patient likely
   community aquired pna as outpatient but was broadened to Vanco/Zosyn
   overnight given worsening. However, patient did improve oxygenation
   with CPAP and diuresis overnight which supports at least a component of
   pulmonary edema to his decompensation. Now saturating well on face
   tent.
   -  Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now pending culture results
   -  F/u respiratory viral studies
   - Continue droplet precautions
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - Although patient does appear HD c/w sepsis plan to keep I/Os at least
   even to net 500cc positive
   .
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI. CKs appear to be close to peaked, but are still
   mildy uptrending. Echo with infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis. Plan
   for cath later on today.
   - Continue ASA, Beta-blocker, Plavix
   - Continue heparin IV gtt for medical management of NSTEMI
   - No integrillin given age and renal failure
   - Continue statin
   - Serial ECGs, trend CEs to confirm declining
   - Plan for cath today. Plan for precath hydration with bicarb and
   mucomyst.
   .
   PUMP: Acute decompensated CHF with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolat and apical HK. - Beta-blocker
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - I/O goal +500cc
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr 2  increased from baseline 1.0 in setting of
   diuresis for acute pulmonary edema and transient hypotension at OSH,
   most likely consistent with prerenal/ATN etiology however consider
   cardiogenic component in setting of new depressed EF.
   - Renally dose meds
   - give mucomyst and bicarb prior to cath
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Chronically elevated but higher than recent baseline,
   monitor daily in setting of initiating statin therapy. Also no
   abdominal pain, Tbili elevation to suggest acute cholangitis/process.
   Also acute hepatitis could be cause of increased elevation
   - trend LFTs, abdominal exam
   - will check hepatitis serologies if trend up. Had normal serologies
   within last 8 years.
   EtOH abuse: Patient endorses history of etoh abuse. On CIWA. Only
   reveived valium x1.
   - continue ciwa
   Essential tremor: On propnolol at baseline
   - Continue metoprolol for now. Will consider transitioning back to
   propanolol pending cath findings

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presents with more than 48 hours of chest congestion, nausea, and is found to have NSTEMI complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory failure. 

Based on the assessment and plan, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: The patient has worsening RLL pneumonia, supported by sputum GS findings, fever, CXR, and leukocytosis. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and potential sepsis.
2. Coronary artery disease/NSTEMI: The patient has evidence of NSTEMI with infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis on echocardiogram. There is a risk of myocardial infarction or worsening ischemia.
3. Acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has acute pulmonary edema and a newly depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 35-40%. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function and fluid overload.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which have increased from baseline. There is a risk of further decline in renal function.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate acute hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury.
6. Ethanol abuse: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and may be at risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M h/o HTN presents with >48 hours chest congestion, nausea found to
   have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary
   edema resulting in respiratory failure.
   .
   Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: ABG supports hypoxic resp failure. CXR
   supports worsening RLL pneumonia. Pneumonia diagnosis further supported
   by sputum GS findings, fever, CXR and leukocytosis. Patient likely
   community aquired pna as outpatient but was broadened to Vanco/Zosyn
   overnight given worsening. However, patient did improve oxygenation
   with CPAP and diuresis overnight which supports at least a component of
   pulmonary edema to his decompensation. Now saturating well on face
   tent.
   -  Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now pending culture results
   -  F/u respiratory viral studies
   - Continue droplet precautions
   - Repeat ABG this am to ensure patient with hypercarbia
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - Although patient does appear HD c/w sepsis plan to keep I/Os at least
   even to net 500cc positive
   .
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI. CKs appear to be close to peaked, but are still
   mildy uptrending. Echo with infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis. Plan
   for cath later on today.
   - Continue ASA, Beta-blocker, Plavix
   - Continue heparin IV gtt for medical management of NSTEMI
   - No integrillin given age and renal failure
   - Continue statin
   - Serial ECGs, trend CEs to confirm declining
   - Plan for cath today. Plan for precath hydration with bicarb.
   .
   PUMP: Acute decompensated CHF with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolat and apical HK. - Beta-blocker
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - I/O goal even
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cre 2  increased from baseline 1.0 in setting of
   diuresis for acute pulmonary edema and transient hypotension at OSH,
   most likely consistent with prerenal/ATN etiology however consider
   cardiogenic component in setting of new depressed EF.
   - Urine lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - give mucomyst and bicarb prior to cath
   .
   TRANSAMINITIS: Chronically elevated but higher than recent baseline,
   monitor daily in setting of initiating statin therapy. Also no
   abdominal pain, Tbili elevation to suggest acute cholangitis/process.
   Also acute hepatitis could be cause of increased elevation
   - trend LFTs, abdominal exam
   - consider checking hepatitis serologies

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with chest congestion, nausea, and was found to have an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema. The patient developed respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He was treated with levofloxacin for presumed community-acquired pneumonia, but his condition worsened, and he was switched to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's respiratory status improved with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and diuresis, indicating a component of pulmonary edema in his decompensation. He is currently on a face tent with good oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of chest congestion, nausea, and respiratory failure indicates a potential complication of pneumonia. His worsening respiratory status and need for mechanical ventilation suggest a high risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's NSTEMI, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and acute pulmonary edema may lead to cardiogenic shock, which is a serious complication characterized by inadequate heart function leading to poor tissue perfusion.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury, possibly due to prerenal/acute tubular necrosis etiology, but also considering a cardiogenic"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is currently experiencing multiple complications. The patient's chief complaint is mild low back pain. 

24-hour events:
- The patient started receiving levofloxacin for presumed CAP.
- Nasal swabs were taken for flu and the patient was placed on respiratory precautions. No respiratory antigens were detected. Urine legionella was negative, but sputum gram stain showed 4+ gram-positive cocci.
- The patient was extubated in the morning but showed increased work of breathing and alkalosis on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. The patient desaturated to the 80s on a Ventimask. A chest X-ray revealed increasing pulmonary edema and worsening right lower lobe consolidation. The patient's respiratory rate improved to the 20s on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oxygen saturation remained in the 90s. However, the patient became uncomfortable on CPAP after two hours and was maintained on a face mask with high flow 100% oxygen. A repeat ABG analysis showed pH 7.47, PaCO2 33, HCO3- 123, and SaO2 25.
- The patient reported daily alcohol intake of 2-3 units for 20 years and appeared tremulous prior to being febrile. CIWA scale was added.
- Troponin levels are trending up (276 > 301 > 327 > 329).
- The patient had a fever of 104.8 degrees rectal at 10 pm and was recultured. Zosyn was started and levofloxacin was discontinued.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed moderate aortic regurgitation, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), ejection fraction of 40% with infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis, no thrombi, no aortic stenosis, mild aortic insufficiency, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Allergies include morphine and amlodipine, with unknown reactions. The last doses of antibiotics administered were levofloxacin at 10:30 AM, vancomycin at 6:00 PM, and piperacillin at 7:11 AM.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion at 650 units/hour, along with other ICU medications such as famotidine, fentanyl, metoprolol, furosemide, and diazepam.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 104.8 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 34.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/68 to 162/96 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

   82M h/o HTN presents with >48 hours chest congestion, nausea found to
   have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary
   edema resulting in respiratory failure.
   Respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  4+ GPC with prelim cx of S. aureus from
   sputum.  On Vano.  Tmax 101.9 but HD stable.  O2 sats in high 90's,
   occasionally drop to low 90's with agitartion but improve with face
   tent.  Currently on nc. Viral studies negative.
   -  Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now pending culture results
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - will pull foley now that clincially improving
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly
   caused by thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.
   - Continue ASA, Beta-blocker, Plavix
   - Continue heparin IV gtt for now which had been kept on overnight in
   case of ventricular thrombus though none seen on echo - will consider
   d/c today
   - Continue statin
   - Serial ECGs, trend CEs to confirm declining
   PUMP:  Decompenstation of CHF significantly improved.  Echo with newly
   depressed EF 35-40% with inferolat and apical HK.  Kept postive fluid
   balance overnight given septic picture in setting on large PNA
   - Beta-blocker
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - I/O goal even to +500cc today
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr trending down, at 1.7 this morning.  Baseline
   1.0, elevation is most likely consistent with prerenal/ATN etiology
   however consider cardiogenic component in setting of new depressed EF.
   - Renally dose meds
   - got mucomyst and bicarb prior to cath
   TRANSAMINITIS: Chronically elevated but higher than recent baseline,
   monitor daily in setting of initiating statin therapy. Also no
   abdominal pain, Tbili elevation to suggest acute cholangitis/process.
   Also acute hepatitis could be cause of increased elevation.  Abd exam
   continues to be benign
   - trend LFTs, abdominal exam
   - will check hepatitis serologies if trend up. Had normal serologies
   within last 8 years.
   EtOH abuse: Patient endorses history of etoh abuse. Was on CIWA
   previously, now off.  Has essential tremor.
   Essential tremor: On propnolol at baseline
   - Continue metoprolol for now. Will consider transitioning back to
   propanolol this morning given clean cath

 PULMONARY EDEMA
   82M h/o HTN presents with >48 hours chest congestion, nausea found to
   have NSTEMI complicated by LV systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary
   edema resulting in respiratory failure.  Also with new loose stool.
   Respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  4+ GPC with prelim cx of S. aureus from
   sputum.  On Vano.  Tmax 101.9 but HD stable.  O2 sats in high 90's,
   occasionally drop to low 90's with agitartion but improve with face
   tent.  Currently on nc. Viral studies negative.
   -  Continue Vanco for now pending culture results, will d/c Zosyn
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   - will pull foley now that clinically improving
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly
   caused by thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.
   - Continue ASA, Beta-blocker, Plavix for 6-12 months of therapy
   - Continue heparin IV gtt for now which had been kept on overnight in
   case of ventricular thrombus though none seen on cath - will consider
   d/c today
   - Continue statin
   PUMP:  Decompenstation of CHF significantly improved.  Echo with newly
   depressed EF 35-40% with inferolat and apical HK.  Kept postive fluid
   balance overnight given septic picture in setting on large PNA
   - Beta-blocker
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - I/O goal even to +500cc today, will not further diurese
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr trending down, at 1.7 this morning.  Baseline
   1.0, elevation is most likely consistent with prerenal/ATN etiology
   however consider cardiogenic component in setting of new depressed EF.
   - Renally dose meds
   TRANSAMINITIS: Chronically elevated but higher than recent baseline,
   monitor daily in setting of initiating statin therapy. Also no
   abdominal pain, Tbili elevation to suggest acute cholangitis/process.
   Also acute hepatitis could be cause of increased elevation.  Abd exam
   continues to be benign
   - trend LFTs, abdominal exam
   - will check hepatitis serologies if trend up. Had normal serologies
   within last 8 years.
   EtOH abuse: Patient endorses history of etoh abuse. Was on CIWA
   previously, now off.  Has essential tremor.
   ESSENTIAL TREMOR: On propnolol at baseline
   - will change back to home propanolol
    DIARRHEA:  Had loose stool x3 this morning, will send for C. diff
   given has been on abx, also 5 bands on diff though may be [**3-6**] large

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with symptoms of chest congestion, nausea, and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema. He also has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's temperature is elevated, and he is experiencing loose stools. His cardiac output and cardiac index indicate that he is not volume overloaded. He is currently receiving vancomycin for the pneumonia, heparin IV for potential ventricular thrombus, aspirin, beta-blocker, and Plavix for coronary artery disease, and statin therapy. His renal function is improving, but he has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. He also has elevated liver enzymes, possibly due to alcohol abuse or statin therapy. The patient's essential tremor is being managed with propranolol. He has had loose stools, and C. difficile testing has been ordered. The patient is on cardiac diet and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. His ICU care includes glycemic control, nutrition, and prophylaxis for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is being considered for transfer to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with chest congestion, nausea, and was found to have NSTEMI complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory failure. He also has new loose stool. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently being treated with vancomycin. His temperature is elevated at 101.9°F, but his vital signs are stable. Oxygen saturation levels are in the high 90s, occasionally dropping to low 90s during agitation but improving with a face tent. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to pneumonia and acute pulmonary edema.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop further complications from the ongoing pneumonia, such as sepsis or secondary infections.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is currently compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has new loose stools, which raises concern for C. difficile infection, especially considering his recent antibiotic use.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embol"

   from [**6-21**] since Vanco started) and levofloxacin for total 8 day course
   [**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**].
   -  Pulm c/s requested for possible bronchoscopy
   - Wean from vent as tolerated. Plan to decrease Fi02 to nontoxic levels
   this morning.
   - Repeat ABG
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   SEPSIS: Pneumona as above. Blood culture data ngtd at this time.
   Patient illustrating septic physiology with hypotension, but may be in
   the setting of intubation. Transitioned from dopamine to levophed for
   tachycardia. Patient appears overall dry after lasix 40 mg IVx2

   CORONARIES: NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly
   caused by thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.
   Likely demand ischemia in the setting of pna.
   - Continue ASA,
   - Hold  Beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   - Hold plavix and heparin given concern of GI bleed
   - Continue statin
   PUMP:  Echo with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolat and apical
   HK.  Kept postive fluid balance overnight given septic picture in
   setting on large PNA
   - Beta-blocker on hold as above
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor who presented with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI). He was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at the emergency department and was transferred for further evaluation. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation, hypotension, tachycardia, and fever spikes. He has been treated with various medications including antibiotics (nafcillin and levofloxacin), diuretics (Lasix), and vasopressors (dopamine and levophed). The patient's renal function has also been affected, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia, sepsis secondary to MSSA infection, acute renal failure, and complications related to his recent NSTEMI.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Continue nafcillin for a total of 3-week course through [**2119-7-11**] and levofloxacin for an 8-day course through [**2119-7-2**].
2. Obtain pulmonary cultures for possible bronchoscopy.
3. Wean from mechanical ventilation as tolerated, aiming to decrease"

   82M with hypertension, essential tremor presented with URI symptoms,
   nausea found to have NSTEMI at OSH transferred for cath and found to
   have MSSA pneumonia.
   Respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  MSSA growing in sputum. Reintubated
   last night for hypoxic respiratory failure. Continues to spike fevers.
   Appreciate ID input. CXR concerning for worsening RIGHT sided pna vs
   hemorrhage.
   - Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**] (starting
   from [**6-21**] since Vanco started) and levofloxacin for total 8 day course
   [**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**].
   - Pulm c/s requested for possible bronchoscopy
   - Wean from vent as tolerated. Plan to decrease Fi02 to nontoxic levels
   this morning.
   - Repeat ABG
   - F/u culture data
   - CIS
   SEPSIS: Pneumonia as above. Blood culture data ngtd at this time.
   Patient illustrating septic physiology with hypotension, but may be in
   the setting of intubation. Transitioned from dopamine to levophed for
   tachycardia. Patient appears overall dry after lasix 40 mg IVx2
   yesterday.
   - 500 cc bolus x1 now
   - Levophed titrated to MAPs greater than 60. Will wean as tolerated
   - Central access obtained overnight
   - F/u cx data
   CORONARIES: NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly
   caused by thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.
   Likely demand ischemia in the setting of pna.
   - Continue ASA,
   - Hold  Beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   - Hold plavix and heparin given concern of GI bleed
   - Continue statin
   PUMP:  Echo with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolat and apical
   HK.  Kept postive fluid balance overnight given septic picture in
   setting on large PNA
   - Beta-blocker on hold as above
   - Consider ACEi once clear BPs and renal function stable
   - I/O goal even to +500cc  to 1 L today
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr trended up to 1.8 in setting of diuresis
   yesterday.  Baseline 1.0.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor who presented with upper respiratory infection symptoms and was found to have non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at the outpatient setting. He was transferred for cardiac catheterization and found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia. He experienced respiratory failure and was reintubated last night due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He continues to spike fevers and has a chest X-ray showing worsening right-sided pneumonia or possible hemorrhage. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is exhibiting signs of septic physiology with hypotension and tachycardia. He is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but blood culture data is still pending.
2. Pneumonia: MSSA pneumonia has been identified, and the patient's symptoms suggest worsening respiratory condition. The chest X-ray is concerning for right-sided pneumonia or pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.8 in the setting of diuresis yesterday. Renal dosing of medications will be necessary.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient had an NSTEMI, which was possibly caused by thrombus formation. Although the coronaries appeared clean after catheterization, there may still be demand ischemia in the setting of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He presented with symptoms of a URI, nausea, and was found to have NSTEMI at OSH. He was transferred for cath and found to have MSSA pneumonia. The patient experienced respiratory failure/pneumonia and was reintubated last night for hypoxic respiratory failure. He continues to spike fevers. The CXR is concerning for worsening right-sided pneumonia versus hemorrhage. The patient has been started on nafcillin for a total of 3-week course and levofloxacin for an 8-day course.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Alveolar Hemorrhage (PAH): The patient's increased work of breathing and the presence of red cells in urine raise concerns for PAH. The pulm c/s advised to continue current management and agreed with discontinuing anticoagulation.

2. Sepsis: The patient is exhibiting septic physiology with hypotension and tachycardia. He is being treated with IV fluids, vasopressors (levophed), and broad-spectrum antibiotics (nafcillin and levofloxacin).

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has trended up to 1.8 in the setting of diuresis yesterday. Renal dosing of medications will be considered.

4. Myocardial Infarction:"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS:  Tolerated pressure support
   briefly yesterday. Now currently on assist control. Large A-a gradient
   by blood gas. Patient with component of respiratory alkalosis, although
   this may be compensatory given metabolic acidosis.
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Vent parameters per ARDSnet protocol
   -          Pulmonary recs
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers,
   although lower grade. ID involved.
   -          Discuss with ID
 given persistent fevers, should we expand
   coverage for anaerobes?
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF
   (LR given non-anion gap metabolic acidosis potentially secondary to
   NS); wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated to 2.4, confirmed on recheck.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency.
   -          Vitamin K PO x1
   -          Recheck coags, FDP, fibrinogen this afternoon
   4. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time given concern for PAH (very low
   likelihood)
   -          Continue statin
   5. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Hold Plavix and heparin given mention of potential PAH,
   although this is unlikely; will likely restart heparin in next 1-2 days
   given concern for thrombus formation at site of hypokinesis
   6. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, admitted for NSTEMI and now complicated by MSSA pneumonia, sepsis, and ARDS. He is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's main issues include hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS, pneumonia/sepsis, coagulopathy, s/p NSTEMI, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to pneumonia and sepsis. This condition can lead to further deterioration in lung function and oxygenation, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient's MSSA pneumonia has progressed to sepsis, as indicated by persistent fevers. If not adequately managed, the infection can spread to other organs, leading to severe complications and potentially life-threatening septic shock.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and FDP levels suggest a coagulation disorder. This can increase the risk of bleeding or clot formation, potentially leading to internal bleeding or thrombosis.
4. s/p NSTEMI: Although the patient's coronary arteries are clean, the NSTEMI may have caused myocardial damage. This can lead to impaired cardiac function, arrhythmias, or even heart failure.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating renal dysfunction. Acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of alcohol abuse, acute coronary syndrome, pneumonia, renal failure, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs and respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. Cultures have been drawn, and the patient's family has been updated on the situation.

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which can progress to AKI if not addressed promptly.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
4. Pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage: Although less likely, the presence of red blood cells in the urine and the patient's respiratory distress may raise concerns about this condition. Further evaluation and consultation with a pulmonologist may be necessary.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He presented with upper respiratory infection symptoms and was found to have non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at the outside hospital. He was transferred for cardiac catheterization and was also found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia. The patient required reintubation last night for hypoxic respiratory failure and continues to spike fevers. His current condition is concerning for worsening right-sided pneumonia versus pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. 

Medical Complications:
1. Septic physiology with hypotension, possibly in the setting of intubation.
2. Tachycardia requiring transition from dopamine to levophed.
3. Dryness after administration of lasix.
4. NSTEMI with clean coronaries, possibly caused by thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.
5. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (35-40%) with inferior and apical wall hypokinesis.
6. Acute renal failure with increased creatinine levels.
7. Potential pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage.

Note: The patient's condition appears to be complex, involving multiple organ systems. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, fluid balance, and laboratory values to assess the progression of his medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, enlarging right sided infiltrate
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Continues on AC; RSBI 58.
   -          Vent parameters per ARDSnet protocol
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Prior to extubation, will need diuresis given large volume
   resuscitation during this hospital course
 will go ahead and start
   today
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved.
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening
   pleural effusion
   -          Add Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF;
   wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR improved to 1.4 with vitamin K 5mg PO x1.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency, although this is a rapid improvement.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Thus DIC less likely. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Restart heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with hypertension, essential tremor, and a history of NSTEMI. He was admitted with multilobar pneumonia and developed MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F, blood pressure ranging from 109/51 to 134/63 mmHg, heart rate between 71-105 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates a total input of 4733 mL and output of 1310 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 232, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the right base,"

   Continues on AC; RSBI 58.
   -          Vent parameters per ARDSnet protocol
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Prior to extubation, will need diuresis given large volume
   resuscitation during this hospital course
 will go ahead and start
   today
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved.
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening
   pleural effusion
   -          Add Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF;
   wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR improved to 1.4 with vitamin K 5mg PO x1.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency, although this is a rapid improvement.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Thus DIC less likely. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Restart heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, essential tremor, and previous NSTEMI. He was admitted for multilobar pneumonia, which has now complicated into MSSA pneumonia and sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been experiencing persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: This is secondary to multilobar pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status will need to be closely monitored, and ventilator parameters should be adjusted according to ARDSnet protocol.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: MSSA pneumonia has persisted despite antibiotic treatment, indicated by persistent fevers. The patient may require a repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening pleural effusion. Additional coverage with Flagyl for anaerobic bacteria may be necessary. Nafcillin should be continued for a total of three weeks, and levofloxacin for a total of eight days.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which has improved with vitamin K administration. Possible causes include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock liver, or nutritional deficiency.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: Direct hyperbilirubinemia is present, making DIC less likely. It may be secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness.
5. Abnormal differential: Monocytosis"

   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, enlarging right sided infiltrate
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Tolerated pressure support briefly
   yesterday. Now currently on assist control. Large A-a gradient by blood
   gas. Patient with component of respiratory alkalosis, although this may
   be compensatory given metabolic acidosis.
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Vent parameters per ARDSnet protocol
   -          Pulmonary recs
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers,
   although lower grade. ID involved.
   -          Discuss with ID
 given persistent fevers, should we expand
   coverage for anaerobes?
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF
   (LR given non-anion gap metabolic acidosis potentially secondary to
   NS); wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated to 2.4, confirmed on recheck.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency.
   -          Vitamin K PO x1
   -          Recheck coags, FDP, fibrinogen this afternoon
   4. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time given concern for PAH (very low
   likelihood)
   -          Continue statin
   5. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Hold Plavix and heparin given mention of potential PAH,
   although this is unlikely; will likely restart heparin in next 1-2 days
   given concern for thrombus formation at site of hypokinesis
   6. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, essential tremor, and recent NSTEMI. He was admitted with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. His fever has persisted despite antibiotic treatment. There is an enlarging right-sided infiltrate on his chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical as indicated by the need for assist control ventilation and a large A-a gradient on blood gas analysis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers suggest ongoing infection despite antibiotic therapy. It is important to review and discuss with the Infectious Disease (ID) team, especially considering the possibility of expanding coverage for anaerobes.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and confirmed coagulopathy require prompt evaluation and management. Vitamin K administration may be necessary, and coagulation studies should be rechecked.
4. s/p NSTEMI: Although the patient's coronary arteries were clean, it is important to continue ASA and statin therapy. Beta-blockers should be held in the setting of sepsis.
5. PUMP dysfunction: The patient's TTE results show a newly depressed ejection fraction of 35-40% with inferolateral and apical hyp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall male with an unknown weight. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine and amlodipine, but the specific reactions are unknown. He has been receiving various antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and nafcillin.

On 06/27/2119 at 12:26 AM, blood cultures were obtained. The patient presented with a fever of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Vitamin K was given once, and the patient is being monitored for any changes in condition. Persistent fevers are not concerning at this time, but if they continue, a CT chest may be performed to reassess for an abscess.

The patient's pulmonary status is being closely monitored. Fluid resuscitation is being administered cautiously, and no plan for bronchoscopy has been made yet.

The patient's ANCA test results are pending. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (LFTs), hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia (platelet count), coagulopathy, fibrinogen, and lactate levels. No new culture data is available as of 10:30 PM.

The patient's allergies include morphine and amlodipine, with unknown reactions. His last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin/tazob"

   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Continues on AC; RSBI 58.
   -          Vent parameters per ARDSnet protocol
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Prior to extubation, will need diuresis given large volume
   resuscitation during this hospital course
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved.
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening
   pleural effusion
   -          Consider expanding anaerobic coverage
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF;
   wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   -          If bilirubin continues to rise, get RUQ ultrasound to assess
   for cholecystitis
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR improved to 1.4 with vitamin K 5mg PO x1.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Thus DIC less likely. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   -          As above, if bilirubin continues to rise, get RUQ ultrasound
   to assess for cholecystitis
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Given presence of atypical cells, raises concern
   for malignancy.
   -          Peripheral smear
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, essential tremor, and recent NSTEMI. He was admitted with multilobar pneumonia and sepsis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment. He is currently intubated and sedated, and his vital signs are stable with the exception of occasional hypertension and high lactate levels. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory system compliance of 55.6 cmH2O/mL. Blood cultures have shown no new data. The patient's coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K administration. His bilirubin levels are elevated, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. The patient also has an abnormal differential count with monocytosis, which could be due to an infectious etiology or malignancy. He is experiencing acute renal failure, possibly prerenal in nature. The patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) but showed clean coronary arteries on catheterization, suggesting demand ischemia. There is also evidence of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (35-40%) with inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. The patient's ICU care includes pulmonary nutrition, arterial and central venous lines, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress"

   -          Vent parameters per ARDSnet protocol
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Prior to extubation, will need diuresis given large volume
   resuscitation during this hospital course

   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved.
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening
   pleural effusion
   -          Add Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF;
   wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR improved to 1.4 with vitamin K 5mg PO x1.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency, although this is a rapid improvement.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Thus DIC less likely. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Restart heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with hypertension and essential tremor who was admitted with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He now has multilobar pneumonia complicated by sepsis and an enlarging right-sided infiltrate. The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia and requires ventilatory support. He also has acute renal failure, likely prerenal due to sepsis. Other issues include coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, abnormal differential, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia/sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to multilobar pneumonia. Continuous ventilatory support and pulmonary recs are necessary. Prior to extubation, diuresis will be required due to the large volume resuscitation during this hospital course.

2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and persistent fevers. ID involvement is recommended. Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening pleural effusion should be done. Flagyl should be added for anaerobic coverage, and Nafcillin should be continued for a total of 3-week course through [**2119-7-11**].

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has declined, likely due to seps"

The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia/sepsis, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, abnormal differential, and a history of NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's multilobar pneumonia is causing secondary respiratory failure, which requires ventilator support and pulmonary recs. Prior to extubation, diuresis will be necessary due to the large volume resuscitation during this hospital course.

2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and persistent fevers, indicating ongoing infection. ID involvement is necessary, and repeat CT chest is needed to assess for loculation or worsening pleural effusion. Adding Flagyl for anaerobic coverage and continuing Nafcillin for a total of 3 weeks are recommended. Levofloxacin should be continued for a total of 8 days.

3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0, but it has been trending up, likely prerenal due to sepsis. Renal dosing of medications is necessary.

   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, enlarging right sided infiltrate
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Continues on AC; RSBI 58. Improving.
   -          Wean to pressure support today as toleraed
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Continue diuresis
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved. Chest CT without indication of loculation/abscess. No
   evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Continue Flagyl at this time
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Stable. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal and ATN given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   -          Expect improvement with diuresis
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
 may be able to
   restart in next 1-2 days
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          As low risk for thrombus formation, holding heparin gtt at
   this time

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, who was initially admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presents with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia/sepsis, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, abnormal differential, acute renal failure, previous NSTEMI, pulmonary edema, and knowledge deficit.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of pneumonia to multilobar or necrotizing pneumonia, development of septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, exacerbation of coronary artery disease, and potential complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Please note that the information provided is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU."

   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Continues on AC; RSBI 58.
   -          Wean to pressure support today as toleraed
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Prior to extubation, will need diuresis given large volume
   resuscitation during this hospital course
 will go ahead and start
   today
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved.
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation or worsening
   pleural effusion
   -          Add Flagyl for anaerobic coverage
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF;
   wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR improved to 1.4 with vitamin K 5mg PO x1.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency, although this is a rapid improvement.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Thus DIC less likely. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Restart heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor who was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Currently, the patient is being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU is as follows:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, resulting in secondary hypoxic respiratory failure. The respiratory support is being weaned gradually as tolerated.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia that has complicated into sepsis. The infection control measures, including antibiotics and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage, are being implemented.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal causes related to sepsis. Renal dosing of medications is being adjusted accordingly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which has improved with vitamin K administration. The differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock liver, or nutritional deficiency.
5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has direct hyperbilirubinemia, which may be secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall male with an unknown weight, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening bilateral edema. There is a concern for worsening underlying pneumonia. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by increasing serum creatinine levels. He has a history of alcohol abuse and possible acute coronary syndrome. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, analgesics, antihypertensives, and supportive care. He has a central venous line and an arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and worsening bilateral edema may suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's deteriorating renal function, indicated by increasing serum creatinine levels, could progress to AKI, a sudden decline in kidney function that requires urgent medical intervention.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and worsening bilateral edema, raise concerns about worsening underlying pneumonia. Prompt treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can include symptoms like agitation, tremors, and seizures.
5. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms may"

   wean Levophed as tolerated
   -          CIS
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR improved to 1.4 with vitamin K 5mg PO x1.
   Differential includes DIC (FDP 10-40, although elevated fibrinogen and
   PTT normal), shock liver (LFTs improved since admission). Could also be
   nutritional deficiency, although this is a rapid improvement.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Thus DIC less likely. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   -          RUQ ultrasound to assess for cholecystitis
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          Restart heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor who was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presents with pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), complicated by sepsis, renal failure, and pulmonary edema. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is stable but requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to multilobar pneumonia. Ventilator parameters will be adjusted per ARDSnet protocol, and pulmonary recs will be implemented.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: MSSA pneumonia persists despite treatment, and the patient has persistent fevers. Repeat CT chest will be done to assess for loculation or worsening pleural effusion. Anaerobic coverage will be added, and nafcillin will be continued for a total of three weeks. Levofloxacin will be given for a total of eight days.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR improved with vitamin K administration. Differential includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock liver, or nutritional deficiency.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: Direct hyperbilirubinemia may be secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness. RUQ ultrasound will be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and alcohol abuse. The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent fevers, worsening bilateral edema, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. He has a history of alcohol abuse and coronary artery disease. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes. The patient is receiving IV fluids, lasix, heparin sodium, fentanyl, famotidine, and other medications as needed. He is also receiving enteral nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress to septic shock if not adequately managed, leading to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not appropriately treated, leading to increased respiratory distress, oxygenation problems, and potential need for intubation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to oliguria, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can manifest as seizures"

   TTE ([**2119-6-28**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   Compared with the prior study of [**2119-6-21**], global left ventricular
   systolic function appears improved (though the technical qualtiy is
   suboptimal on both studies).

   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable, likely
   prerenal and ATN given sepsis; expect improvement as patient continues
   to autodiurese
   -          Renally dose meds
   6. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Restart low-dose propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure support and doing well. The plan is to wean to pressure support today if tolerated and if secretions are well-controlled. Pulmonary recommendations include pneumonia treatment and holding off on diuretics at this time.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and is experiencing persistent fevers. ID involvement is noted, and chest CT does not show any indication of loculation or abscess. No evidence of cholecystitis is observed. The plan includes continuing Nafcillin for a total of 3 weeks and levofloxacin for a total of 8 days.
3. Coagulopathy: The INR is trending downwards appropriately.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: Direct bilirubin is improving, likely secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis is observed.
5. Acute renal failure: The baseline creatinine is 1.0, and it has remained stable, likely"

   TTE ([**2119-6-28**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   Compared with the prior study of [**2119-6-21**], global left ventricular
   systolic function appears improved (though the technical qualtiy is
   suboptimal on both studies).

   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, enlarging right sided infiltrate
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Continues on AC; RSBI 58. Improving.
   -          Wean to pressure support today as toleraed
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Continue diuresis
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved. Chest CT without indication of loculation/abscess. No
   evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Continue Flagyl at this time
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Stable. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal and ATN given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   -          Expect improvement with diuresis
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
 may be able to
   restart in next 1-2 days
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          As low risk for thrombus formation, holding heparin gtt at
   this time

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor.
- He was admitted with NSTEMI and now has MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis.
- The patient has multilobar pneumonia and is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure.
- He also has acute renal failure, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and an abnormal differential.
- The patient's coronary arteries are clean, suggesting that the NSTEMI was likely caused by a thrombus that has since resolved with medical therapy.
- The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 35-40% with inferolateral and apical hypokinesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's multilobar pneumonia is causing secondary hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on AC (assisted ventilation) and his RSBI (respiratory system resistance index) is improving.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia that is not responding to treatment, as indicated by persistent fevers. The ID (infectious disease) team is involved, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics, including nafcillin and levofloxacin.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.0, and it is trending upwards, likely due to prerenal and acute tubular necrosis caused by sepsis"

   TTE ([**2119-6-28**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   Compared with the prior study of [**2119-6-21**], global left ventricular
   systolic function appears improved (though the technical qualtiy is

   ID involved. Chest CT without indication of loculation/abscess. No
   evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])

   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   5. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable, likely
   prerenal and ATN given sepsis; expect improvement as patient continues
   to autodiurese
   -          Renally dose meds
   6. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Restart low-dose propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presents with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has secondary multilobar pneumonia, which is causing hypoxic respiratory failure. He is doing well on pressure support ventilation and is planned for weaning to pressure support today if tolerated. The plan for extubation depends on his tolerance and control of secretions.

2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia that has led to sepsis. He has persistent fevers despite treatment, and the ID (Infectious Disease) team is involved. A chest CT scan showed no indication of loculation or abscess, and there is no evidence of cholecystitis. The patient should continue Nafcillin for a total of 3 weeks and levofloxacin for a total of 8 days. Flagyl should also be continued, and culture data should be followed.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR (International Normalized Ratio) is trending downwards appropriately. This indicates that the coagulation parameters are improving.

4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has direct hyperbilirubinemia, which"

","The patient is a 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. These include acute pain, chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), renal failure, acute (ARF), fever (hypothermia), alcohol abuse, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary edema, and a knowledge deficit.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/47 to 179/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on endotracheal tube with ventilator support.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but decreased levels of hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are within normal range. The bilirubin levels are slightly elevated. The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 113-159 mg/dL. The ECG shows sinus rhythm with no ST elevation or depression.

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, skin is not assessed, and neurologic examination is not assessed. The patient is unable to respond to commands, movement, tone, or pain assessment.

   TTE ([**2119-6-28**]):  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   Compared with the prior study of [**2119-6-21**], global left ventricular
   systolic function appears improved (though the technical qualtiy is
   suboptimal on both studies).

   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, enlarging right sided infiltrate
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Continues on AC; RSBI 58. Improving.
   -          Wean to pressure support today as toleraed
   -          Pulmonary recs
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Continue diuresis
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved. Chest CT without indication of loculation/abscess. No
   evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Continue Flagyl at this time
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Stable. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal and ATN given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   -          Expect improvement with diuresis
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
 may be able to
   restart in next 1-2 days
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness
   -          As low risk for thrombus formation, holding heparin gtt at
   this time

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He now presents with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and multilobar infiltrates. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia/sepsis, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, abnormal differential, acute renal failure, and a past NSTEMI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to multilobar pneumonia. He continues to receive airway clearance and pressure support, and his RSBI is improving.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and continues to have persistent fevers. He is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy with nafcillin and levofloxacin. The chest CT shows no indication of loculation or abscess, and there is no evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is trending downwards appropriately.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has direct hyperbilirubinemia, which may be secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis is seen.
5. Abnormal differential: The patient's differential includes infectious etiology and malignancy. It is difficult to assess in the setting of sepsis.

   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   Compared with the prior study of [**2119-6-21**], global left ventricular
   systolic function appears improved (though the technical qualtiy is
   suboptimal on both studies).

   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   ID involved. Chest CT without indication of loculation/abscess. No
   evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Continue Flagyl at this time
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Maintain CVP 8-12, MAP>60; if falls below this, bolus IVF
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Stable. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis.
   -          Trend bilirubin
   5. Abnormal diff:  Differential for monocytosis includes infectious
   etiology, malignancy. Difficult to assess in setting of sepsis.
   6. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine slowly trending up,
   likely prerenal and ATN given sepsis.
   -          Renally dose meds
   -          Expect improvement with diuresis
   7. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries, NSTEMI possibly caused by
   thrombus that had since resolved with medical therapy.  Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Hold beta-blocker in the setting of sepsis
 may be able to
   restart in next 1-2 days
   -          Hold Plavix at this time
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE with newly depressed EF 35-40% with inferolateral and
   apical hypokinesis
   -          Beta-blocker on hold as above
   -          Would benefit from ACE inhibitor once over acute illness

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is now experiencing MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Secondary to multilobar pneumonia. The patient continues to be on assisted ventilation (AC) and has an improving respiratory system infection index (RSBI).

2. Pneumonia/sepsis: MSSA pneumonia. The patient has persistent fevers, and the infectious disease team is involved. A chest CT scan shows no indication of loculation or abscess, and there is no evidence of cholecystitis. The patient is being treated with nafcillin for a total of three weeks and levofloxacin for a total of eight days. Flagyl is also being continued.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is trending downwards appropriately.

4. Hyperbilirubinemia: Direct bilirubin levels are stable and may be secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness. No evidence of cholecystitis is seen.

5. Abnormal differential: The patient's differential count shows monocytosis, which can be due to an infectious etiology or malignancy. It is difficult to assess in the setting of sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), now complicated by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has successfully been extubated and is currently on pressure support ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 119/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propranolol, famotidine, heparin sodium, nafcillin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes, while other values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is doing well on pressure support and is planned to be weaned further today if tolerated. Extubation is planned today if the patient tolerates well and if secretions are well-controlled.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia, and ID involvement is noted. Chest"

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS
   1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Extubated yesterday and now with hypoxemia and lowering CO2.
   Respiratory alkalosis likely due tachypnea in setting of hypoxemia.
   -          Increase oxygen by Nc. Repeat ABG
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Patient diuresing well on his own
 hold off on diuretics at
   this time
   2. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient with persistent fevers.
   Torso CT without indication of loculation/abscess. No evidence of
   cholecystitis. Sputum gram stain only shows yeast.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Continue Flagyl at this time
   -          Follow culture data
   -          CIS
   3. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   4. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. This may be secondary to
   cholestasis in setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn earlier in his
   course. No evidence of cholecystitis on u/s..
   5. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable at 2.9, likely
   prerenal and ATN given sepsis; expect improvement as patient continues
   to autodiurese
   -          Renally dose meds
   -          I/O goal neg. 1 L. Lasix bolus prn to achieve goal.
   6. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries. Repeat TTE with EF 65% and
   no evidence of aneurysm of focal wall motion abnls. Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Restarted low-dose propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix and anticoagulation at this time since no
   aneurysm or focal wall motion abnl on repeat TTE
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor who was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is now diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been extubated but is experiencing hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/47 mmHg to 170/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals ecchymosis on the lips, crackles at the right lung base, moderately distended abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, and right upper extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as decreased platelet count and serum albumin. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL and current level of 2.9 mg/dL. He also has hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy. The patient's coronary angiography showed clean coronaries, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, admitted for NSTEMI and now diagnosed with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and ARDS. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday but is experiencing hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 119/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 4 L NC. The patient's physical examination shows ecchymosis on the lips, crackles at the right lung base, moderately distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, and right upper extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia and lowering CO2 levels after extubation, which may be secondary to multilobar pneumonia. It is important to increase oxygen delivery and repeat ABG to assess the patient's respiratory status.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has persistent fevers, and the torso CT did not show any loculation or abscess. However, sputum gram stain only shows yeast, and the patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, essential tremor, and NSTEMI. He was admitted with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and ARDS. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday but is now experiencing hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 C (101.1 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 119/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 4 L NC. The patient's weight has increased from 89 kg at admission to 93.9 kg. He has no known allergies and is receiving various medications including propranolol, famotidine, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia after being extubated, which may lead to further respiratory distress and potential failure if not addressed promptly.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia, and despite antibiotic treatment, he continues to have persistent fevers. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis if the current treatment plan is ineffective.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.0, and his current creatinine level is stable at 2.9. This indicates a possible prerenal and ATN due to"

   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Extubated Thursday, with hypoxemia and lowering CO2. Respiratory
   alkalosis likely due tachypnea in setting of hypoxemia.
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Albuterol nebs and mucomyst
   -          Diurese to help improve oxygenation. Started Lasix gtt at
   8mg/hr yesterday with goal net negative 1300 over last 24. Con
t goal
   negative 1L.
   -          Appreciate Pulm input
   #. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient febrile to 99.1
   overnihgt, WBC at 14.0 from 10.7. Torso CT without indication of
   loculation/abscess. No evidence of cholecystitis. Sputum gram stain
   only shows yeast.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date) and levofloxacin for
   total 8 day course ([**2119-6-24**] through [**2119-7-2**])
   -          Continue Flagyl at this time
   -          Follow culture data
   -          CIS
   # HTN: Improved overnight with hydralazine to 124-154 systolic on PO
   Hydralazine, Lasix and BB.
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. 3.8
 2.7. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn
   earlier in his course. No evidence of cholecystitis on u/s..
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable at 2.9
 2.7,
   likely prerenal and ATN given sepsis; expect improvement as patient
   continues to autodiurese
   -          Renally dose meds
   -          I/O goal neg. 1 L. Lasix gtt to achieve goal.
   #. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries. Repeat TTE with EF 65% and
   no evidence of aneurysm of focal wall motion abnls. Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Restarted low-dose propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix and anticoagulation at this time since no
   aneurysm or focal wall motion abnl on repeat TTE
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and chronic pain. He is currently on multiple medications including furosemide, heparin, and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. He has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an FiO2 of 0.6 and a face tent. His current temperature is 37.7°C, heart rate is 75 bpm, blood pressure is 149/61 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 1,842 mL and output of 3,185 mL. He has received a total of 1,100 mL of blood products and 1,432 mL of IV fluids. The patient's weight is currently 95 kg. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis progression: The patient's current diagnosis includes sepsis without organ dysfunction. If left untreated or not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, essential tremor, and now with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS, and acute renal failure. The patient was admitted with NSTEMI and is currently in the ICU.

24-hour events:
- The patient required Shovel FM for hypoxia, large A-A, and respiratory alkalosis in the morning. Started on Mucomyst and Albuterol nebs per pulmonary. Subsequently, ABG improved to 7.43/33/81/23 from 7.48/31/60/23.
- Restarted Lasix drip at 8 per hour; goal 1L negative. Negative 1.2 L at MN.
- 1500 lytes and Cr showed 2.9 (Am Cr = 2.9).
- Started on pureed diet with alt sips and bites initiated per S and S.
- Added Hydralazine for improved afterload control. SBPs improved to 120s to 150s. Amlodipine allergy confirmed as real. Reaction is HTN, facial swelling, and erythema.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status (not delirium)
2. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction
4. Diarrhea
5. Impaired skin integrity
6. Knowledge deficit

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presents with multilobar pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was extubated on Thursday but experienced hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis due to tachypnea. This morning, he had flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension, which could be secondary to mucus plug, pulmonary embolism, or coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, renal failure, fever, alcohol abuse, ACS, pulmonary edema, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: This condition occurs when the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body. It is already present and may worsen if the patient does not respond to treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). This infection may progress and lead to worsening respiratory symptoms or develop into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection. If not managed appropriately, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presents with pneumonia complicated by sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure. The patient has been extubated but continues to experience hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis due to tachypnea in the setting of hypoxemia. He has an altered mental status but is not delirious. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: MSSA pneumonia, with the patient being febrile and having an elevated white blood cell count.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.0, and it is stable at 2.9/2.7, likely prerenal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given sepsis.
4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin).
5. Alcohol abuse.
6. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS, unstable angina, coronary ischemia).
7. Pulmonary edema.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, acute renal failure, alcohol abuse, and acute coronary syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a potential risk for further complications related to infection.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory complications and worsening of the patient's overall condition if not appropriately managed.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, leading to additional complications if not managed effectively.

4. Alcohol Abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse can contribute to complications such as liver dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections.

5. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, indicating a potential risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction.

6. Fever: The patient has presented with fever, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring and managing the patient's temperature is crucial to prevent complications.

7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.

   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS; extubated [**2119-6-29**].
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Extubated [**2119-6-29**]. Overall has been improving. On [**2119-7-2**] experienced
   respiratory distress secondary to hypertension
 flash pulmonary edema.
   This improved with nitro gtt, Lasix 80mg IV, dilaudid 0.5mg IV x1
   (given allergy to morphine), and CPAP. On [**2119-7-3**] experienced
   respiratory distress secondary to mucous plugging. Improved with
   suctioning. At this time still requiring supplemental oxygen; 6L nasal
   canula.
   -          Emphasis on blood pressure control and aggressive chest PT,
   suctioning
   -          Serial ABGs
   -          Lasix bolus as needed
 goal negative 500cc today; patient
   responds well to Lasix 80mg IV
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Albuterol nebs
   -          D/c mucomyst given tachyphylaxis
   -          Appreciate pulmonary input
   #. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient febrile to 101.4
   overnight. WBC continues to rise, now with bandemia. Concern for
   worsening infection, although not apparent based on CXR. Flagyl was
   discontinued [**2119-7-2**]; unclear if this was treating a particular
   pathogen, but given worsened fevers and bandemia overnight, Flagyl was
   restarted. Torso CT from several days ago without indication of
   loculation/abscess. No evidence of cholecystitis. Sputum gram stain
   only shows yeast.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date)
   -          Levaquin completed
   -          Flagyl restarted
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation
   -          Follow culture data
   -          CIS
   # HTN:  Continue propranolol; holding Captopril for now given increase
   in BP with starting ACE inhibitor
 concern for renal artery stenosis
   (renal artery ultrasound ordered); increase hydralazine for better BP
   control
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. 3.8
 2.7. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn
   earlier in his course. No evidence of cholecystitis on u/s.
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely related to ATN during previous
   hypotensive episodes, although we would expect to see improvement by
   this time. Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable at 2.7. Monitor
   -          Renally dose meds
   #. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries. Repeat TTE with EF 65% and
   no evidence of aneurysm of focal wall motion abnls. Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Continue propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix and anticoagulation at this time since no
   aneurysm or focal wall motion abnl on repeat TTE
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, essential tremor, and recent NSTEMI. He was admitted with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and ARDS. He was extubated on [**2119-6-29**]. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and alcohol abuse. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90-110s, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation in the mid-90s on 6L FM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia, and there is concern for worsening infection. If left untreated, it could progress to severe sepsis or septic shock.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 2.7, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) during previous hypotensive episodes. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to worsening renal function.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has direct hyperbilirubinemia, which may be secondary to cholest"

   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS; extubated [**2119-6-29**].
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Extubated Thursday, with hypoxemia and lowering CO2. Respiratory
   alkalosis likely due tachypnea in setting of hypoxemia.
        Flash pulmonary edema this his morning, in setting of
   hypertension. Unclear if hypertension preceded respiratory distress.
   Other possibilities include mucus plug or pulmonary embolism. ACS a
   possibility as well. With all above interventions, patient now with
   improved respiratory rate, O2 saturation on facemask; by ABG, patient
   is not becoming hypercarbic.
   -          Serial ABGs
   -          Lasix bolus as needed
 goal negative 500cc today; patient
   responded well to Lasix 80mg IV this morning
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Albuterol nebs and mucomyst
   -          Appreciate pulmonary input
   -          Recheck chest x-ray to reassess for decreased lung markings
   in left upper lobe; no frank Pneumothorax is seen
   #. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient febrile to 101.4
   overnight. WBC continues to rise, now with bandemia. Concern for
   worsening infection, although not apparent based on CXR. Flagyl was
   discontinued [**2119-7-2**]; unclear if this was treating a particular
   pathogen, but given worsened fevers and bandemia overnight, Flagyl was
   restarted. Torso CT from several days ago without indication of
   loculation/abscess. No evidence of cholecystitis. Sputum gram stain
   only shows yeast.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date)
   -          Levaquin completed

   -          Follow culture data
   -          CIS
   # HTN:  Continue propranolol; holding Captopril for now given increase
   in BP with starting ACE inhibitor
 concern for renal artery stenosis
   (renal artery ultrasound ordered); start hydralazine 10mg IV Q6 hours
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. 3.8
 2.7. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn
   earlier in his course. No evidence of cholecystitis on u/s..
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely related to ATN during previous
   hypotensive episodes, although we would expect to see improvement by
   this time. Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable at 2.7. Monitor
   -          Renally dose meds
   #. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries. Repeat TTE with EF 65% and
   no evidence of aneurysm of focal wall motion abnls. Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Continue propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix and anticoagulation at this time since no
   aneurysm or focal wall motion abnl on repeat TTE
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), now presenting with multilobar pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a fever of 101.4, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. The patient's respiratory rate is increased, and he is using accessory muscles. Auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles, and oxygen saturation is in the mid-90s on 6 liters per minute (L/min) of supplemental oxygen. Blood gas analysis shows stable respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's physical examination shows ecchymosis on the lips, tachycardia, and no murmurs or gallops on cardiac auscultation. Chest examination reveals bibasilar crackles, and abdominal examination shows moderately distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds. Extremity examination reveals right greater than left upper extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), bandemia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Blood cultures remain negative, and urine cultures also show no growth.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and essential tremor admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been diagnosed with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially intubated but was successfully extubated on [**2119-6-29**]. 

The patient presented with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia. He experienced flash pulmonary edema this morning, which could be due to hypertension, a mucus plug, pulmonary embolism, or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, acute renal failure, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, fever, alcohol abuse, ACS, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The plan includes serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, Lasix bolus as needed, pneumonia treatment, albuterol nebs, mucomyst, and rechecking chest x-ray. The patient is currently receiving nafcillin for MSSA pneumonia, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. 

The patient has hypertension and is being monitored for renal artery stenosis. His coagulopathy is improving, and he has hyperbilirubinemia, which may be due to cholestasis or Zosyn. Acute renal failure has been identified, with baseline creatinine of 1.0 and stable creatinine at 2.7. 

Regarding the s/p NSTEMI, the patient's coronary catheterization showed clean coronaries, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65% with no evidence of aneurysm or focal wall motion abnormalities. 

The patient is on ASA, propranolol, and statin, but Plavix and anticoagulation are currently held. The patient also had a pump failure with an initially depressed EF of 35-40% and inferolateral and apical hypokinesis on the initial TTE, but it has since normalized without wall motion abnormalities on the repeat TTE. Therefore, there is no indication for anticoagulation at this time."

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and chronic pain. Upon admission, the patient was started on non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. However, the non-invasive ventilation was stopped after 07:02 AM. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.4°F and he is experiencing tachycardia with a heart rate of 100 bpm. Blood cultures were drawn at 12:30 AM, and the patient's blood pressure is stable ranging from 90-110 mmHg. Auscultation reveals upper airway noise and bibasilar crackles. The patient has received Lasix 80mg IV, nebulizer, and suctioning, showing improvement. The patient's respiratory alkalosis is stable according to blood gas results. Allergies include morphine, amlodipine, and unknown. The patient has received various medications such as hydralazine, heparin sodium, and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and respiratory distress.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented to the ICU with altered mental status, sepsis without organ dysfunction, diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, acute renal failure, community-acquired pneumonia, fever, alcohol abuse, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary edema, and pain control. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 to 210/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on 6L FM, and stable oxygenation on blood gas analysis. 

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation for approximately 24 hours, which was stopped after improvement. Blood cultures and urine culture were drawn due to suspicion of infection. An EKG was also performed. The patient's blood pressure remained elevated despite the administration of hydralazine, leading to the initiation of renal ultrasound to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,593 mL and output of 2,680 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of -1,087 mL. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and hydralazine. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (13.5 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (10.3 g/d"

   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS; extubated [**2119-6-29**].
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Extubated [**2119-6-29**]. Overall has been improving. On [**2119-7-2**] experienced
   respiratory distress secondary to hypertension
 flash pulmonary edema.
   This improved with nitro gtt, Lasix 80mg IV, dilaudid 0.5mg IV x1
   (given allergy to morphine), and CPAP. On [**2119-7-3**] experienced
   respiratory distress secondary to mucous plugging. Improved with
   suctioning. At this time still requiring supplemental oxygen; 6L nasal
   canula.
   -          Emphasis on blood pressure control and aggressive chest PT,
   suctioning
   -          Serial ABGs
   -          Lasix bolus as needed
 goal negative 500cc today; patient
   responds well to Lasix 80mg IV
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Albuterol nebs
   -          D/c mucomyst given tachyphylaxis
   -          Appreciate pulmonary input
   #. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Patient febrile to 101.4
   overnight. WBC continues to rise, now with bandemia. Concern for
   worsening infection, although not apparent based on CXR. Flagyl was
   discontinued [**2119-7-2**]; unclear if this was treating a particular
   pathogen, but given worsened fevers and bandemia overnight, Flagyl was
   restarted. Torso CT from several days ago without indication of
   loculation/abscess. No evidence of cholecystitis. Sputum gram stain
   only shows yeast.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date)
   -          Levaquin completed
   -          Flagyl restarted
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation
   -          Follow culture data
   -          CIS
   # HTN:  Continue propranolol; holding Captopril for now given increase
   in BP with starting ACE inhibitor
 concern for renal artery stenosis
   (renal artery ultrasound ordered); increase hydralazine for better BP
   control
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. 3.8
 2.7. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn
   earlier in his course. No evidence of cholecystitis on u/s.
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely related to ATN during previous
   hypotensive episodes, although we would expect to see improvement by
   this time. Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable at 2.7. Monitor
   -          Renally dose meds
   #. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries. Repeat TTE with EF 65% and
   no evidence of aneurysm of focal wall motion abnls. Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Continue propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix and anticoagulation at this time since no
   aneurysm or focal wall motion abnl on repeat TTE
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   82M with hypertension, essential tremor admitted with NSTEMI, now with
   MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis, ARDS; extubated [**2119-6-29**].
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Secondary to multilobar pneumonia.
   Extubated [**2119-6-29**]. Overall has been improving. On [**2119-7-2**] experienced
   respiratory distress secondary to hypertension
 flash pulmonary edema.
   This improved with nitro gtt, Lasix 80mg IV, dilaudid 0.5mg IV x1
   (given allergy to morphine), and CPAP. On [**2119-7-3**] experienced
   respiratory distress secondary to mucous plugging. Improved with
   suctioning. At this time still requiring supplemental oxygen;50% shovel
   mask.
   -          Emphasis on blood pressure control and aggressive chest PT,
   suctioning
   -          Serial ABGs
   -          Lasix bolus as needed
 goal negative 500cc today; patient
   responds well to Lasix 80mg IV
   -          Pneumonia treatment as below
   -          Albuterol nebs
   -          D/c mucomyst given tachyphylaxis
   -          Appreciate pulmonary input
   #. Pneumonia/sepsis:  MSSA pneumonia. Afebrile since yesterday
   afternoon and WBC ct trending down and bandemia resolved.CT chest
   yesterday showed improved multifocal consolidations, no evidence of
   lung abscess. Sputum gram stain only shows yeast.
   -          Continue Nafcillin for total 3 week course through [**2119-7-11**]
   (start date [**6-21**], Vancomycin initiation date)
   -          Levaquin completed
   -          Con t Flagyl
   -          Repeat CT chest to assess for loculation
   -          Follow culture data
   -          CIS
   # HTN:  Continue propranolol; holding Captopril for now given increase
   in BP with starting ACE inhibitor
 concern for renal artery stenosis
   (renal artery ultrasound ordered); increase hydralazine for better BP
   control
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR trending downwards appropriately.
   #. Hyperbilirubinemia:  Direct. Improving. 3.8
 2.7. This may be
   secondary to cholestasis in setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn
   earlier in his course. No evidence of cholecystitis on u/s.
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely related to ATN during previous
   hypotensive episodes, although we would expect to see improvement by
   this time. Baseline 1.0. Creatinine stable at 2.7. Monitor
   -          Renally dose meds
   #. s/p NSTEMI: Cath showed clean coronaries. Repeat TTE with EF 65% and
   no evidence of aneurysm of focal wall motion abnls. Likely demand
   ischemia in the setting of pneumonia.
   -          Continue ASA
   -          Continue propranolol per home regimen
   -          Hold Plavix and anticoagulation at this time since no
   aneurysm or focal wall motion abnl on repeat TTE
   -          Continue statin
   8. PUMP:  TTE initially with newly depressed EF 35-40% with
   inferolateral and apical hypokinesis. On repeat TTE on [**2119-6-28**], normal
   EF without wall motion abnormalities. Thus, no indication for
   anticoagulation at this time.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, essential tremor, admitted with NSTEMI, now with MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and ARDS. He is extubated on [**2119-6-29**]. The patient's main medical complications include hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia, pneumonia/sepsis caused by MSSA, acute renal failure likely related to ATN during previous hypotensive episodes, and s/p NSTEMI with clean coronaries on catheterization. The patient also has hyperbilirubinemia, likely secondary to cholestasis in the setting of acute illness or due to Zosyn earlier in his course. Additionally, the patient has a coagulopathy with INR trending downwards appropriately. There is no evidence of cholecystitis on ultrasound. The patient's renal function is stable with creatinine at 2.7. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to mucous plugging or flash pulmonary edema, development of new lung abscess, progression of renal failure, worsening coagulopathy, and recurrence of myocardial ischemia. It is important to monitor the patient's vital signs closely and provide aggressive chest physical therapy and suctioning as needed. Serial ABGs should be done to assess respiratory status. Lasix bolus should be given as needed to achieve negative fluid balance. Pneumonia treatment should continue with nafcillin for a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presenting with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially intubated but has since been extubated. He experienced respiratory distress due to mucous plugging and required suctioning. His condition has been improving, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's blood pressure is being managed, and aggressive chest physiotherapy (PT) and suctioning are ongoing. Serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) are being monitored, and Lasix bolus is given as needed to achieve negative fluid balance. The patient is also receiving treatment for pneumonia with nafcillin and Flagyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen and is on CPAP overnight due to ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia/sepsis: Although the patient's fever has resolved, and white blood cell count (WBC) trend is improving, continued monitoring and treatment for MSSA pneumonia are necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains on the normotensive to hypotensive side, indicating a need for further management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been improving overall, but experienced respiratory distress on [**2119-7-3**] due to mucous plugging. He is still requiring supplemental oxygen and is on CPAP therapy.

The patient's blood pressure is being managed with hydralazine, and there is concern for renal artery stenosis, so a renal ultrasound has been ordered. His electrolytes and kidney function are stable, although he has a simple cyst in his right kidney. The patient's coagulopathy is improving, but he has hyperbilirubinemia, which may be secondary to acute illness or earlier use of Zosyn.

The patient had a previous NSTEMI, and a catheterization showed clean coronaries. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65% with no evidence of aneurysm or focal wall motion abnormalities. The patient's initial TTE showed a depressed EF of 35-40% with inferolateral and apical hypokinesis, but this was later found to be normal on"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now has MSSA pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was intubated but has since been extubated and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/97 to 106/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lab results show a slight decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. His blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with hydralazine and propranolol. There are no significant findings on the abdominal ultrasound. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries, and his repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65% with no evidence of aneurysm or focal wall motion abnormalities. The patient's initial TTE showed a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and essential tremor. He was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and now has methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was extubated on [**2119-6-29**].

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia. He is still requiring supplemental oxygen and is being managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight. The plan includes blood pressure control, aggressive chest physiotherapy (PT), and suctioning. Serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is also being performed.

Regarding pneumonia/sepsis, the patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down, and bandemia has resolved. A CT chest scan showed improved multifocal consolidations without evidence of lung abscess. Sputum gram stain only shows yeast. The antibiotic treatment for MSSA pneumonia should be continued for a total of three weeks through [**2119-7-11**], starting from [**6-21**]. Flagyl should be continued through [**2119-7-7**], and follow-up culture data will be monitored.

Additionally, the patient's hypertension is being managed with intravenous (IV) medications, and there is"
