   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: 54M s/p OTL tx with recent urosepsis admission (PsA ses MER)
   requiring SICU stay with acute kidney injury.  Yesterday went for
   routine liver biopsy, during which he had two apneic periods.
   Post-procedure had LOC, loss of pulse, CPR for less than 30 seconds.
   Initial rhythm SVT 160s, then sinus, then stable VT, then polymorphic
   VT.  150mg amio, 2gm Mg.  Converted to sinus brady.  To MICU.
   Overnight polymorphic VT multiple times, sometimes with LOC
   shocks.  Got dopamine for heartrate overdriving.
   Suspected due to reglan, celexa.  Hepatic USG no hematoma.  Vomited
   overnight, lethargic.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is being unresponsive with ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has a history of orthotopic liver transplantation (OTL) and recently experienced urosepsis, requiring a stay in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) with acute kidney injury. The patient underwent a routine liver biopsy yesterday and experienced two apneic periods. Post-procedure, the patient had a loss of consciousness (LOC), loss of pulse, and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for less than 30 seconds. The initial rhythm was supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) at 160 beats per minute, then sinus rhythm, followed by stable VT, and then polymorphic VT. The patient was given 150 mg of amiodarone and 2 grams of magnesium, which converted the rhythm to sinus bradycardia. The patient was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Overnight, the patient experienced multiple episodes of polymorphic VT, sometimes associated with LOC and received defibrillation shocks. Dopamine was administered to manage the heart rate. The patient's suspected medications include Reglan (metoclopramide) and Celexa (citalopram). A hepatic ultrasound showed no hematoma. The patient vomited overnight and was lethargic.

The 24-hour events include the insertion of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who has undergone an orthotopic liver transplant and has a history of urosepsis. He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) and experienced acute kidney injury. The patient underwent a routine liver biopsy, during which he had two apneic periods and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for less than 30 seconds. He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin, and unknown reactions to Tosades. He is currently on multiple medications, including dopamine, heparin, morphine, pregabalin, flomax, vanc oral, and tacro 0.5mg q12.

On examination, the patient appears chronically ill and is oriented to person, place, and date. His heart rhythm is regular, and his lungs are clear. He has 1+ edema bilaterally and warm extremities. Neurological examination reveals right pupil dilation, tongue deviation to the right, and intact cranial nerves. Peripheral vascular examination could not be assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hyponat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, s/p orthotopic liver transplant, hypertension, h/o C. diff, admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b ARF, now transferred to the MICU for brief unresponsiveness, polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval thought due to combination of reglan and prograf. The patient has chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, ESLD, chronic leg pain, urosepsis, and chronic neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced two episodes of VT, which were cardioverted. The cause of VT is thought to be a significantly prolonged QT interval due to the combination of prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function.
2. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's prolonged QT interval increases the risk of developing serious arrhythmias, including VT and torsades de pointes.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and anemia.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's echocardiogram showed global systolic dysfunction, indicating impaired heart function. This can increase the risk of heart failure and other cardiac complications.
5. ESLD (end-stage liver disease): The patient's history of ESLD increases the risk of complications related"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. The patient has been admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the MICU for unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval, which is thought to be due to the combination of reglan and prograf in the setting of worsened renal function.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 116/77 mmHg to 126/89 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's neurological examination reveals that he is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, ESLD with EtOH cirrhosis post liver transplant, hypertension, and previous C. difficile infection. The patient's current medications include dopamine, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Liver function tests are relatively stable, but there are abnormal findings on imaging studies, including partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells and unchanged left maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis post-orthotopic liver transplant, hypertension, and h/o C. diff. He was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the MICU for brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval. 

The patient has chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, chronic leg pain, urosepsis, and requires tube feeds for nutritional needs. He has multiple lines including a PICC line and PIV. Prophylactic measures include heparin SQ, PPI, and bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening of renal function, cardiac arrhythmias, infections, and complications related to the liver transplant. It is crucial to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, continue dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70-80 bpm, and closely monitor the patient's vitals and lab results. Regular echocardiograms should be done to assess cardiac function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, s/p orthotopic liver transplant, hypertension, and h/o C. diff, admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b ARF, now transferred to the MICU for brief unresponsiveness, SVT/NSVT/Polymorphic VT. The patient has chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, pancytopenia, acute renal failure, s/p liver transplant, urosepsis, and liver biospy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and acute renal failure. The recent worsening of creatinine levels suggests a potential complication related to ATN or Tacrolimus toxicity.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient experienced SVT, NSVT, and polymorphic VT. These arrhythmias can lead to unresponsiveness and potentially life-threatening events. The prolonged QT interval on the EKG increases the risk for further arrhythmias.
3. Bleeding: The patient underwent a liver biopsy and is at risk of bleeding, especially considering the unresponsiveness after the procedure. Monitoring of Hct and serial biopsies may be necessary.
4. Infection: Although the urosepsis has resolved, the patient's immunosuppressed state due to liver transplant increases the risk of infections. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis are important.
5. Rejection: As a liver transplant recipient, the patient is at risk of organ rejection. Regular monitoring of liver function and drug levels, such as Tacrolimus, is crucial.
6. Nutritional issues: The patient requires nutritional support through tube feeds, and close monitoring of electrolytes is essential.

Please note that this is a summary and potential medical complications based on the information provided. A comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of liver transplant, renal failure, and long QT syndrome. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's current medications include dopamine, heparin, pantoprazole, MS Contin, Bactrim, flomax, and pregabalin.

From the progress note, it appears that the patient has been experiencing several medical complications. These include chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest due to long QTc, liver transplant, resolved urosepsis, and pain management.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/79 to 126/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction. Other notable lab values include low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated potassium levels.

The patient's plan includes continuing to dose medications based on renal function, monitoring urine osmolality, weaning dopamine back to 10 mcg/kg/min, checking the EKG, keeping potassium and magnesium levels replete, touching base with cardiology, and scheduling follow-up echo. The patient is also transitioning to rapammune for liver transplant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of organ transplant and chronic renal failure. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and a long QT interval. The patient has been on dopamine support and was found to have global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20% on echocardiogram. His medications have been adjusted, including switching from tacrolimus to rapammune for liver transplant management. The patient's allergies and previous antibiotic use were noted. His vital signs are relatively stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,794 mL and output of 1,985 mL since midnight. He is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, clear lungs, and leg edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of VT and long QT interval puts him at risk for recurrent cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of the EKG and maintaining potassium and magnesium levels is essential.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, especially if there is inadequate fluid management or further kidney injury.
3. Liver Transplant Complications: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of liver transplantation, chronic renal failure, and long QT syndrome. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to his long QTc interval. The patient's current medications include dopamine, heparin, pantoprazole, MS Contin, Bactrim, flomax, and pregabalin.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent a transthoracic echo showing global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.
- The patient's evening EKG showed a shorter QT interval, and he was maintained on dopamine. Tacrolimus was suspected as a potential cause, and the patient was switched to rapammune.
- Transient bradycardia occurred with nausea, and dopamine was slightly increased.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin.
- The patient received vancomycin orally at 12:15 PM on 03/15/2011.
- Infusions include dopamine at 12.5 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.
- Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), MS Contin 15mg PO BID, Bactrim, flomax, and pregabalin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He presented to the ICU with pseudomonal urosepsis and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient experienced a brief unresponsiveness episode and was found to have polymorphic VT due to a prolonged QT interval, likely caused by the combination of Reglan and Prograf in the setting of worsened renal function. He underwent cardioversion twice and has been on dopamine to maintain HR in the 70-80 range while waiting for medications to wear off.

The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 122/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels and signs of chronic kidney disease (CKD). He also has elevated liver enzymes and evidence of cirrhosis. Other notable findings include hypoactive bowel sounds, soft and distended abdomen, and warm extremities with palpable deep tendon reflexes.

The patient's medication regimen includes dopamine, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other medications. He has been weaned off MS Contin and switched to prn"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis and acute renal failure (ARF), and then transferred to the MICU for unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval. The patient's current conditions include chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, ESLD, acute renal failure, chronic leg pain, urosepsis, and nutrition/glycemic control. The patient is currently on dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70-80 bpm while waiting for medications to wear off. The plan is to wean dopamine on Monday and continue cardiac monitoring, serial EKGs, strict control of electrolytes, and repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) due to prolonged QT interval: The patient experienced a brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT, which is thought to be caused by a combination of medications (Reglan and Prograf) in the setting of worsened renal function. The patient has been cardioverted twice and is currently on dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70-80 bpm.
2. Chronic renal failure (CRF): The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels have been improving since admission to the ICU. It is important to continue monitoring renal function and following renal recommendations"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis and orthotopic liver transplant, who was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis. He experienced episodes of brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), which were thought to be due to a combination of medications (Reglan and Prograf) causing prolonged QT intervals. The patient underwent cardioversion twice and is currently on dopamine to maintain his heart rate. His renal function has been improving since admission, and he has resolved his acute renal failure. He also has chronic leg pain, likely due to neuropathy, and chronic pain management with narcotics. The patient's urosepsis has resolved, and he is currently on prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's episodes of VT were likely caused by prolonged QT intervals due to the combination of Reglan and Prograf. It is important to monitor his QT intervals and avoid medications known to cause prolonged QT.
2. Renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, which is improving but still requires close monitoring. The cause of renal failure could be sepsis or toxicity from colistin.
3. Liver rejection: As a post-liver transplant patient, there is a risk of liver rejection. The patient had an uncomplicated liver biopsy to assess for rejection, and daily monitoring of liver function tests (L"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis and acute renal failure (ARF), which is thought to be caused by either ARF or toxicity from colistin. The patient experienced two episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was successfully cardioverted both times. The VT is believed to be due to a prolonged QT interval caused by a combination of reglan and prograf, worsened by renal dysfunction. The patient is currently on dopamine to maintain heart rate between 70-80 bpm while waiting for the effects of the medications to wear off. The plan is to continue dopamine today and wean it on Monday. The patient's condition will be monitored with tele monitoring, serial EKGs, and strict control of electrolytes. An echocardiogram will be repeated prior to discharge to assess for recovery of ejection fraction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has already experienced two episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.
2. Prolonged QT interval: The prolonged QT interval increases the risk of developing potentially life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring due to the possibility of further deterioration or delayed recovery.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest due to long QTc, liver transplant, and resolved urosepsis. They are currently being treated in the ICU and are on various medications and infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. If left untreated or unmanaged, this could lead to further deterioration of kidney function and potential complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.

2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) and has a long QTc interval, which increases the risk of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and appropriate management, such as adjusting medications or interventions, will be crucial to prevent future episodes.

3. Infection Risk: The patient has a history of urosepsis, which has resolved, but they are still at risk for developing infections due to their immunocompromised state, particularly after the liver transplant. Prophylactic antibiotics may be necessary to prevent infections, such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.

4. Liver Function: As a liver transplant recipient, the patient's liver function needs to be closely monitored for any signs of rejection or complications related to the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with various medical conditions. The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia and has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, cardiac arrest, liver transplant, and urosepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a sinus rhythm and SpO2 of 100%. However, there are some potential medical complications that could arise from the information provided.

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's recent episode of ventricular tachycardia indicates a potential cardiac complication. It is essential to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and ensure proper management to prevent further episodes.

2. Chronic renal failure: The patient's improvement in renal function has slowed down, suggesting that the chronic renal failure may not be resolving as expected. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.

3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's previous cardiac arrest was due to long QTc, which may require ongoing cardiac monitoring and evaluation. The plan to wean dopamine and discuss possible discharge should be carefully assessed based on the patient's cardiac stability.

4. Liver transplant: As the patient has undergone a liver transplant, they may be on immune suppression medication. Monitoring for any signs of rejection or complications related to the liver transplant is necessary.

5. Urosepsis: Although the urosepsis has resolved, it is important to ensure that there are no lingering effects or new"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU for a brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval, which was thought to be due to the combination of reglan and prograf. The patient has chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, ESLD with ETOH cirrhosis s/p liver transplant, and acute renal failure. He is currently on dopamine to maintain HR in 70-80 bpm while waiting for medications to wear off. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced episodes of VT, which was successfully cardioverted twice. It is likely due to a significantly prolonged QT interval caused by the combination of prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function. The patient should continue dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70-80 bpm, and medications known to cause prolonged QT interval should be held.

2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has chronic renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management of renal failure are necessary. Renal consult service has been followed, and the patient's creatinine has been improving since admission to ICU.

3. Ethanol Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of ESLD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, and altered nutrition. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure ranging from 91/56 to 75/49 mmHg, heart rate between 64 and 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

The patient is receiving dopamine infusion at a rate of 5.2 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,040 mL and output of 2,775 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 735 mL. The patient's urine output is within an acceptable range.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level, which suggests worsening renal function. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are also within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are within normal limits, indicating no ongoing myocardial injury. Liver function tests and other blood chemistries are also within normal limits.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through a Renal (Full) diet at a rate of 40 mL/hour. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He is currently admitted to the MICU for brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval. The patient has chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia, ESLD (ethanol cirrhosis), and urosepsis.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires fluid boluses to maintain MAP >65 and SBP >85. There is no evidence of bleeding.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced VT and was cardioverted twice. The VT is likely due to a significantly prolonged QT interval caused by the combination of prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which is indicated by elevated creatinine levels. He is being followed by the renal consult service.
4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a recent cardiac arrest with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. There may be a cardiac component contributing to his current condition.
5. ESLD: The patient has ESLD due to ethanol cirrhosis and underwent a liver transplant. He had an uncomplicated liver biopsy to assess for rejection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is ventricular tachycardia. The patient experienced QTc prolongation during attempted dopa wean and required IVF boluses. There were also drops in blood pressure with attempts to wean Dopa.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is being treated with heparin sodium for prophylaxis. They have been on vancomycin for Clostridium difficile prophylaxis since March 18th. The patient's pain management plan has been switched from MS Contin to prn oxycodone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm (61-76 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 92/62 mmHg (69-111/49-78 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (12-18 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 2.9 K/uL
- Platelet count: 62 K/uL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 110 mg/dL
- Sodium: 137 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.6 mEq/L
- Chloride: 28.7%
- Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
- Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,040 mL, with outputs of 2,775 mL total out, including 1,010 mL of urine output.

The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results are //27/. Physical examination findings include no acute distress, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, muscle wasting, warm skin, attentive and oriented neurologically, and no edema or ascites.

Potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension requiring further management, potential cardiac issues due to the history of chronic renal failure and ventricular tachycardia, ongoing monitoring and treatment for chronic kidney disease, and the need for immune support as a liver transplant patient. Additionally, the patient is at risk for infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcers."

   54 yo M with EtOH cirrhosis s/p Orthotopic liver transplant, HTN, h/o
   C. diff, admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b [**Hospital 8767**] transferred to
   the MICU for brief unresponsiveness, Polymorphic VT in the setting of
   prolonged QT interval thought [**12-30**] combination of reglan and prograf.
   .
   # Hypotension: asymptomatic, mentating well, MAP 69.  Responds to fluid
   boluses. No evidence of bleeding ,HCT stable. Was previously sepstic
   but no septic physiology now, no obvious source and  looks well however
   is immunosupressed.  EF was 20% recently after code, may have cardiac
   component.
   - try to wean dopamine
   - keep MABp >65, SBP >85 and IVF as needed
   - pan culture
   - stop flomax
   - consider repeat echo in several days
   - consider reinstating flutrocortisone
   #Ventricular tachycardia s/p cardioversion x2: Most likely due to
   significantly prolonged QT interval thought due to combination of
   prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function.  He was
   cardioverted [**12-30**] unresponsiveness in the setting of VT.  Has been on
   dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70
s-80
s while waiting for medications
   to wear off.    Echocardiogram was done which showed global systolic
   dysfunction most likely [**12-30**] cardioversion.
   - continue dopamine gtt today, plan to wean today, will touch base with
   cardiology re: goal given that QTc
s stable and not improving
   - monitor on tele, serial EKGs
   - holding nodal agents, medications known to cause prolonged QT
   interval: metoclopramide, celexa, tacro
   - strict control of electrolytes, [**Hospital1 **] lytes with repletion
   - will need repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge to see if EF
   recovers
   .
   #ESLD [**12-30**] ETOH cirrhosis s/p Liver transplant, s/p Liver Biospy:
   Patient had uncomplicated liver biospy to assess for rejection.  Hct
   stable afterward with no evidence of bleeding.  Pancytopenia appears
   stable.
   - f/u biopsy results
   - daily HCT
   - Xplant [**Doctor First Name 458**] following, Hepatology following, appreciate recs
   - no tacrolimus, continue rapamune, f/u levels and continue morning
   [**Last Name (un) **] levels
   - monitor daily LFT
s while immunosupp regimen being changed
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure: followed by renal consult service, thought [**12-30**]
   ATN from urosepsis vs toxicity from colistin.  Creatinine has been
   improving since admission to ICU possibly [**12-30**] dopamine vs. just
   resolving ATN.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Cont to trend BUN/Cr
   - holding diuretics for now and IVF for now
   .
   #Chronic Leg Pain
 [**12-30**] neuropathy and pt reports prior hip fx, on ms
   contin as well as morphine for breakthrough, currently pain free and
   not requiring prn
s.  Given that narcotics have contributed to slowed
   gi motility and need for reglan which likely contributed to VT, would
   likely benefit from weaning narcotics as tolerated.
   - continue PRN morphine as needed
   - monitor narcotic requirements and titrate as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He was admitted to the ICU for brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval. The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, ventricular tachycardia, acute renal failure, ESLD, chronic leg pain, and urosepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently asymptomatic and mentating well, but has a MAP of 69. He responds to fluid boluses and there is no evidence of bleeding. However, he is immunosuppressed, which makes him more susceptible to infections.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia and required cardioversion. The cause of the VT is believed to be a significantly prolonged QT interval due to the combination of prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function. The patient is currently on dopamine to maintain HR in the 70-80 range while waiting for medications to wear off.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure and is being followed by the renal consult service. It is thought to be either ATN from urosepsis or toxicity from colistin. Creatinine has been improving since admission to the ICU, possibly due to dopamine or resolving ATN"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo M with EtOH cirrhosis s/p Orthotopic liver transplant, HTN, h/o
   C. diff, admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b [**Hospital 8767**] transferred to
   the MICU for brief unresponsiveness, Polymorphic VT in the setting of
   prolonged QT interval thought [**12-30**] combination of reglan and prograf.
   .
   # Hypotension: asymptomatic, mentating well, MAP 69.  Responds to fluid
   boluses. No evidence of bleeding ,HCT stable. Was previously sepstic
   but no septic physiology now, no obvious source and  looks well however
   is immunosupressed.  EF was 20% recently after code, may have cardiac
   component.
   - try to wean dopamine
   - keep MABp >65, SBP >85 and IVF as needed
   - pan culture
   - stop flomax
   - consider repeat echo in several days
   - consider reinstating flutrocortisone
   #Ventricular tachycardia s/p cardioversion x2: Most likely due to
   significantly prolonged QT interval thought due to combination of
   prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function.  He was
   cardioverted [**12-30**] unresponsiveness in the setting of VT.  Has been on
   dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70
s-80
s while waiting for medications
   to wear off.    Echocardiogram was done which showed global systolic
   dysfunction most likely [**12-30**] cardioversion.
   - continue dopamine gtt today, plan to wean today, will touch base with
   cardiology re: goal given that QTc
s stable and not improving
   - monitor on tele, serial EKGs
   - holding nodal agents, medications known to cause prolonged QT
   interval: metoclopramide, celexa, tacro
   - strict control of electrolytes, [**Hospital1 **] lytes with repletion
   - will need repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge to see if EF
   recovers
   .
   #ESLD [**12-30**] ETOH cirrhosis s/p Liver transplant, s/p Liver Biospy:
   Patient had uncomplicated liver biospy to assess for rejection.  Hct
   stable afterward with no evidence of bleeding.  Pancytopenia appears
   stable.
   - f/u biopsy results
   - daily HCT
   - Xplant [**Doctor First Name 458**] following, Hepatology following, appreciate recs
   - no tacrolimus, continue rapamune, f/u levels and continue morning
   [**Last Name (un) **] levels
   - monitor daily LFT
s while immunosupp regimen being changed
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure: followed by renal consult service, thought [**12-30**]
   ATN from urosepsis vs toxicity from colistin.  Creatinine has been
   improving since admission to ICU possibly [**12-30**] dopamine vs. just
   resolving ATN.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Cont to trend BUN/Cr
   - holding diuretics for now and IVF for now
   .
   #Chronic Leg Pain
 [**12-30**] neuropathy and pt reports prior hip fx, on ms
   contin as well as morphine for breakthrough, currently pain free and
   not requiring prn
s.  Given that narcotics have contributed to slowed
   gi motility and need for reglan which likely contributed to VT, would
   likely benefit from weaning narcotics as tolerated.
   - continue PRN morphine as needed
   - monitor narcotic requirements and titrate as needed
   .
   #Urosepsis: Resolved.  Finished courses of antibiotics
   (meropenem/colistin)

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU for a brief period of unresponsiveness and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of prolonged QT interval. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is responding well to fluid boluses. There is no evidence of bleeding, and his hemoglobin level is stable. The patient has a history of hypertension, Clostridium difficile infection, and pseudomonal urosepsis. He is immunosuppressed due to the liver transplant. The patient's ejection fraction was recently measured at 20%, which may indicate a cardiac component. The medical team is trying to wean dopamine and maintain mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg and systolic blood pressure above 85 mmHg. The patient has had episodes of ventricular tachycardia that required cardioversion, and it is thought to be due to a combination of prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function. The patient is currently on dopamine to maintain heart rate in the 70s-80s. An echocardiogram showed global systolic dysfunction, likely related to the cardioversion. The patient's kidney function is improving, and he has resolved his urosepsis. He has chronic leg pain due to neuropathy and a history of hip fracture, but he is"

   C. diff, admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis c/b [**Hospital 8767**] transferred to
   the MICU for brief unresponsiveness, Polymorphic VT in the setting of
   prolonged QT interval thought [**12-30**] combination of reglan and prograf.
   # Hypotension: asymptomatic, mentating well, MAP 69.  Responds to fluid
   boluses. No evidence of bleeding ,HCT stable. Was previously sepstic
   but no septic physiology now, no obvious source and  looks well however
   is immunosupressed.  EF was 20% recently after code, may have cardiac
   component.
   - continue to wean dopamine as tolerated by QTc and BP
   - keep MAP >60, SBP >85
   - holding off on IVF boluses unless appears intravascularly deplete,
   goal to keep I/O even
   - f/u Cx data
   - holding flomax
   - consider repeat echo in several days
   - consider restarting flutrocortisone
   #Ventricular tachycardia s/p cardioversion x2: Most likely due to
   significantly prolonged QT interval thought due to combination of
   prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function.  He was
   cardioverted [**12-30**] unresponsiveness in the setting of VT.  Has been on
   dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70
s-80
s while waiting for medications
   to wear off.    Echocardiogram was done which showed global systolic
   dysfunction most likely [**12-30**] cardioversion.
   - continue dopamine gtt today, wean as tolerated by QTc
   - appreciate cardiology involvement
   - monitor on tele, serial EKGs
   - holding nodal agents, medications known to cause prolonged QT
   interval: metoclopramide, celexa, tacro
   - strict control of electrolytes, [**Hospital1 **] lytes with repletion
   - will need repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge to see if EF
   recovers
   #ESLD [**12-30**] ETOH cirrhosis s/p Liver transplant, s/p Liver Biospy:
   Patient had uncomplicated liver biospy to assess for rejection.  Hct
   stable afterward with no evidence of bleeding.  Pancytopenia appears
   stable.
   - f/u biopsy results
   - daily HCTs
   - Xplant [**Doctor First Name 458**] following, Hepatology following, appreciate recs
   - no tacrolimus, continue rapamune, f/u levels and continue morning
   [**Last Name (un) **] levels
   - monitor daily LFT
s while immunosupp regimen being changed
   #Acute Renal Failure: followed by renal consult service, thought [**12-30**]
   ATN from urosepsis vs toxicity from colistin.  Creatinine has been
   improving since admission to ICU possibly [**12-30**] dopamine vs. just
   resolving ATN.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Cont to trend BUN/Cr
   - holding diuretics for now
   #Chronic Leg Pain
 [**12-30**] neuropathy and pt reports prior hip fx, on ms
   contin as well as morphine for breakthrough, currently pain free and
   not requiring prn
s.  Given that narcotics have contributed to slowed
   gi motility and need for reglan which likely contributed to VT, would
   likely benefit from weaning narcotics as tolerated.
   - PRN morphine as needed, titrate down as tolerated
   #Urosepsis: Resolved.  Finished courses of antibiotics
   (meropenem/colistin). Now completed 7-day course of empiric PO Vanc
   given h/o C.diff.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of prolonged QT interval, hypotension, and previous episodes of unresponsiveness. The patient has several medical complications including acute renal failure, chronic leg pain (neuropathy), and urosepsis. He is receiving various medications such as dopamine, heparin, pantoprazole, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which was cardioverted twice. This condition is likely due to a significantly prolonged QT interval caused by the combination of prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and continue dopamine therapy to maintain a heart rate of 70-80 beats per minute.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, possibly due to urosepsis or toxicity from colistin. Creatinine levels have been improving since admission, possibly due to dopamine therapy. The patient is being followed by the renal consult service, and it is recommended to trend BUN/Cr levels and hold diuretics for now.

3. Chronic Leg Pain (Neuropathy): The patient reports chronic leg pain"

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He has hypertension (HTN) and a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for unresponsiveness and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, but not requiring supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is lying comfortably in bed without acute distress, has a soft and non-tender abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, warm extremities, and palpable deep tendon reflexes. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's creatinine level is decreasing, indicating improvement in renal function.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of fatigue and dry mouth. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and cardiac arrest. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/59 to 110/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,410 mL and output of 2,415 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 1,005 mL. The patient has received a total of 525 mL of IV fluids.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL, indicating possible renal dysfunction. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is currently on various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and a nutrition supplement called Nutren Renal (Full) at a rate of 80 mL/hour.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for fatigue and dry mouth. The physical examination findings are largely unremarkable, with no assessment of peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, or other systems.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include worsening renal function, potential bleeding due to"

   boluses. No evidence of bleeding, HCT stable. Was previously sepstic
   but no septic physiology now, no obvious source and  looks well however
   is immunosupressed.  EF was 20% recently after code, may have cardiac

   recovers
   #Inability to tolerate TFs: Unclear etiology. Pt feels ""full"" with
   feeds and nauseous, with vomiting. Possibly related to an underlying
   abdominal process.

   # Hypotension:  Resolved, SBP in low 100
s. asymptomatic, mentating
   well.  Responds to fluid boluses. No evidence of bleeding, HCT stable.
   Was previously sepstic  but no septic physiology now, no obvious source
   and  looks well however is immunosupressed.  EF was 20% recently after
   code, may have cardiac component. Now weaned off Dopa and stable.
   - goal MAP >65, SBP >85
   - holding off on IVF boluses unless appears intravascularly deplete,
   goal to keep I/O even
   - f/u Cx data
   - f/u Abdominal CT as below
   - holding flomax
   - consider repeat echo in several days
   - low threshold to start antibiotics if appears infected
   #Ventricular tachycardia s/p cardioversion x2: Most likely due to
   significantly prolonged QT interval thought due to combination of
   prograf and reglan in the setting of worsened renal function.  He was
   cardioverted [**12-30**] unresponsiveness in the setting of VT.  Has been on
   dopamine gtt to maintain HR in 70

s while waiting for medications
   to wear off.    Echocardiogram was done which showed global systolic
   dysfunction most likely [**12-30**] cardioversion.  Now weaned off dopamine gtt
   with stable QTc. No ectopy either.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement
   - monitor on tele, serial EKGs
   - holding nodal agents, medications known to cause prolonged QT
   interval: metoclopramide, celexa, tacro
   - strict control of electrolytes with repletion
   - will need repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge to see if EF
   recovers
   #Inability to tolerate TFs: Unclear etiology. Pt feels ""full"" with
   feeds and nauseous, with vomiting. Possibly related to an underlying
   abdominal process. SBO unlikely w/o distension and passing. [**Month (only) 60**] have
   ileus. Is having a small amount of diarrhea
   - CT-Abd/Plv today to eval for intra-abdominal process
   - send for c.diff
   - low threshold to start antibiotics if appears infected
   #Urosepsis: Resolved.  Finished courses of antibiotics
   (meropenem/colistin). Now completed 7-day course of empiric PO Vanc
   given h/o C.diff. +UA yesterday, but not treating given that it looks
   improved from old UAs and per ID's suggestion.
   - f/u Urine Cx sent [**3-20**]
   - low threshold to start antibiotics if appears infected: ? Meropenem &
   Colistin
   #Acute Renal Failure: Cont to improve 2.4->2.2.  Followed by renal
   consult service, thought [**12-30**] ATN from urosepsis vs toxicity from
   colistin.  Creatinine has been improving since admission to ICU
   possibly [**12-30**] dopamine vs. just resolving ATN.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Cont to trend BUN/Cr
   - holding diuretics for now
   #ESLD [**12-30**] ETOH cirrhosis s/p Liver transplant, s/p Liver Biospy:
   Patient had uncomplicated liver biospy to assess for rejection.  Hct
   stable afterward with no evidence of bleeding.  Pancytopenia appears

   #Chronic Leg Pain
 [**12-30**] neuropathy and pt reports prior hip fx, on ms
   contin as well as morphine for breakthrough, currently pain free and
   not requiring prn

   gi motility and need for reglan which likely contributed to VT, would
   likely benefit from weaning narcotics as tolerated.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis and chronic renal failure, who underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. He was admitted to the MICU for unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval. The patient is currently stable, with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >85. He is being closely monitored for any signs of infection, cardiac dysfunction, or other complications. The patient's current medical problems include urinary tract infection (UTI), hypoglycemia, pain control, alteration in nutrition, chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia, and inability to tolerate tube feeds. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. UTI: The patient has a history of UTI, and there is a pending urine culture. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or changes in urine output, is necessary.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced an episode of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent further episodes.
3. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management, especially considering his chronic leg pain and recent hip fracture. Opioid medications should be used cautiously due to the risk of slowed gastrointestinal motility.
4. Nutritional issues: The patient is currently unable to tolerate tube feeds, which may be due to an underlying abdominal process"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, s/p orthotopic liver transplant, hypertension, and h/o C. diff. He was admitted with pseudomonal urosepsis and transferred to the MICU for brief unresponsiveness and polymorphic VT in the setting of prolonged QT interval. The patient is immunosuppressed and has chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient had episodes of VT, which were cardioverted twice. The prolonged QT interval is thought to be due to the combination of reglan and prograf in the setting of worsened renal function.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient had an episode of hypoglycemia with a glucose level of 39 mg/dL, but was asymptomatic.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had urosepsis, which has since resolved. However, he is still at risk for developing another UTI.
4. Inability to tolerate tube feeds: The patient feels ""full"" with feeds and nauseous, with vomiting. There is a possibility of an underlying abdominal process causing this.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving, but he continues to have renal dysfunction.
6. Chronic leg pain: The patient has neuropathy and reports prior hip fracture. He is currently pain-free on narcotics, but may"
