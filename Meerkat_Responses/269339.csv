","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of breast cancer and colon cancer, who presents with symptoms of lower flank pain, hematuria, and intermittent bradypnea. She was transferred to the ICU for a drop in hemoglobin level and closer monitoring. The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding likely due to the recurrence of cancer seen on recent imaging. She has also been experiencing multiple episodes of blood pressure drops, resulting in the transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday, with her current critical value being 31.4.

The patient has been found to have a soft tissue mass causing renal obstruction and hydronephrosis. A urology consultation has been obtained, and a stent placement is planned today if the patient remains hemodynamically stable. The patient's Foley catheter will be removed, and she will follow up with urology recommendations.

The patient has a history of metastatic cancer, most likely colon cancer based on her medical history. The primary oncologist will be contacted on Monday, as the patient is currently stable. 

The patient has renal failure, as indicated by a creatinine level of 1.9 and 2.0, with a baseline creatinine of 0.95 prior to admission. There are no signs of urinary obstruction, and the patient has good urine output. 

The patient is also diagnosed with depression, likely situational, and a consultation with a social worker"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of breast cancer and colon cancer who has undergone chemotherapy and radiation. She presented with left flank pain and hematuria, as well as intermittent bradycardia and hypotension. The patient was transferred to the ICU for a drop in hemoglobin (HCT) and closer monitoring.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely secondary to recurrence of colon cancer. The patient has been experiencing bloody stools and is at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Hydronephrosis/Urinary tract infection (UTI) - The patient has a soft tissue mass causing renal obstruction and hydronephrosis. A urinary catheter was placed, and urine cultures were obtained. The patient will have a stent placed on Monday to alleviate the obstruction.
3. Metastatic cancer - Given the patient's history of colon and breast cancer, the presence of metastatic disease is likely. Further evaluation and discussion with the primary oncologist will be done on Monday.
4. Renal failure - The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. This may be secondary to hydronephrosis or another underlying cause. Close monitoring and appropriate management will be required.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has evidence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) clot extending into the left renal vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, colon cancer, and hypothyroidism. She presented with left flank pain and reported hematuria, bradycardia, and intermittent bradycardia for one month. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to a drop in hemoglobin levels and closer monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient likely has GIB secondary to recurrence of colon cancer, which was seen on recent imaging. She has experienced intermittent bradycardia and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday. Her current critical value is 31.4.
2. Hydronephrosis and Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has evidence of hydronephrosis with a soft tissue mass causing renal obstruction. A urinary analysis (UA) was positive, and she will undergo stent placement today if hemodynamically stable. She also has a urinary tract infection, for which ciprofloxacin has been prescribed.
3. Metastatic Cancer: The patient has a history of colon and breast cancer, and it is most likely that this is metastatic colon cancer based on her medical history. Further discussion with the primary oncologist will be done on Monday.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from a baseline of 0.95 to"

   86yo female with a history of multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 193**]
   cancer and breast cancer was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for monitoring
   after ureteral stent placement by urology. She was initially admitted
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of left-sided hydronephrosis and was also found
   to have BRBPR.
   1. Left Sided Hydronephrosis
   Patient was found to have left-sided hydronephrosis likely related to
   metastatic lymph node. Etiology of the metastatic lymph node is
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] is now s/p urology stent placement today.
   - Appreciate urology input
   - Will follow-up with urology regarding the need for ciprofloxacin
   given negative urine culture
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely
   2. GI Bleed
   Patient underwent significant GI bleed requiring 2 blood transfusions
   but has since had stable Hct with no further episodes of GI bleeding.
   Thought to be related to rectal cancer; plan for flex sigmoidoscopy
   today for further evaluation.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hematocrits
   - maintain 2 large bore IVs
   - maintain active type and cross
   - NPO since MN for flex sig today with tap water enema this AM
   - holding coumadin for now
   - f/u GI input
   3. Liver and adrenal lesions
   Patient was found to have progressive liver and adrenal lesions and
   increased lymphadenopathy on recent CT scan. Etiology of these lesions
   is unclear, may be metastatic lesions secondary to [**Hospital1 193**] or breast
   cancer.
   - will follow-up with patient and daughter regarding goals of care
   - will follow-up with patient's outpatient oncologist regarding
   recommendations for further evaluation
   4. Renal Failure
   Etiology is most likely post-renal given evidence of obstruction on CT
   scan, although may be worsened with pre-renal causes given GI bleed.
   Patient's renal failure has improved since admission and more rapidy
   now s/p placement of ureteral stent.
   - continue to monitor
   5. Depression
   Stable
   - appreciate social work input
   - continue lorazepam and SSRI
   6. h/o clot
   Patient has a history of PE in the past and now with evidence of IVC
   clot extending into the left renal vein on CT scan.
   - will hold warfarin for now pending GI evaluation
   - will need to follow-up with patient and family regarding risks and
   benefits of coumadin in the setting of GI bleed
   7. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine 112mcg PO daily
   8. Glaucoma
   Stable

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with multiple medical problems including a history of cancer and breast cancer. She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring after ureteral stent placement by urology. The patient was initially admitted for management of left-sided hydronephrosis and was also found to have BRBPR (blood-tinged urine).

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Left-sided Hydronephrosis: The patient has left-sided hydronephrosis, which is likely related to metastatic lymph nodes. The etiology of the metastatic lymph nodes is unclear. The patient underwent urology stent placement today.

2. GI Bleed: The patient had a significant gastrointestinal bleed that required two blood transfusions. However, her hemoglobin level has stabilized, and there have been no further episodes of GI bleeding. It is thought to be related to rectal cancer. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is planned today for further evaluation.

3. Liver and adrenal lesions: The patient was found to have progressive liver and adrenal lesions, along with increased lymphadenopathy on recent CT scan. The etiology of these lesions is unclear, possibly metastatic lesions secondary to previous cancer or breast cancer.

4. Renal Failure: The etiology of the renal failure is most likely post-renal given evidence of obstruction on CT scan, although it may be worsened by pre-renal causes due to the GI bleed"

   Assessment and Plan
   86yo female with a history of multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 193**]
   cancer and breast cancer was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for monitoring
   after ureteral stent placement by urology. She was initially admitted
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for management of left-sided hydronephrosis and was also found
   to have BRBPR.
   1. Left Sided Hydronephrosis
   Patient was found to have left-sided hydronephrosis likely related to
   metastatic lymph node (unclear primary); now s/p ureteral stent.
   - Appreciate urology input
   - Will follow-up with urology regarding the need for ciprofloxacin
   given negative urine culture
   - Continue to monitor UOP closely
   2. Renal Failure
   Etiology is most likely post-renal given evidence of obstruction on CT
   scan, although may be worsened with pre-renal causes given GI bleed.
   Patient's renal failure has improved since admission and more rapidy
   now s/p placement of ureteral stent.
   - Continue to monitor
   3. GI Bleed
   Patient underwent significant GI bleed requiring 2 blood transfusions
   but has since had stable Hct with no further episodes of GI bleeding.
   Given h/o unresected rectal cancer (s/p chemo), most likely etiology of
   GIB is disease progression.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hematocrits, maintain 2 large bore IVs, maintain active type and
   cross
   - Will need to address goals of care with family (?further work-up
   versus hospice), primary oncologist
   - Palliative care consulted
   - Will contact GI regarding need for flex sig following family meeting
   - Continue holding coumadin for now
   4. Liver and adrenal lesions
   Patient was found to have progressive liver and adrenal lesions and
   increased lymphadenopathy on recent CT scan. Etiology of these lesions
   is unclear, may be metastatic lesions secondary to [**Hospital1 193**] or breast
   cancer.
   - Will follow-up with patient and daughter regarding goals of care
   - Will follow-up with patient's outpatient oncologist regarding
   recommendations for further evaluation
   5. Depression
   Stable
   - appreciate social work input
   - continue lorazepam and SSRI
   6. H/o clot
   Patient has a history of PE in the past and now with evidence of IVC
   clot extending into the left renal vein on CT scan.
   - Will hold coumadin for now as above; will need to follow-up with
   patient and family regarding risks and benefits of coumadin in the
   setting of GI bleed likely from increasingly invasive rectal cancer
   7. Lower back pain: No lytic lesions on prior imaging. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   musculoskeletal [**2-5**] lying in bed.
   - Continue current pain management
   - Consider further w/u if pain increasing or new neurologic findings
   8. Hypothyroidism
   Stable
   - continue levothyroxine 112mcg PO daily
   9. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue timolol

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of multiple medical problems including breast cancer and rectal cancer. She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring after ureteral stent placement by urology. The patient was initially admitted for management of left-sided hydronephrosis and was also found to have BRBPR.

The patient's current condition includes left-sided hydronephrosis, renal failure, GI bleed, liver and adrenal lesions, depression, history of clot, lower back pain, hypothyroidism, and glaucoma.

The plan includes monitoring the patient's urine output closely, continuing to monitor renal function, addressing goals of care with the family, consulting with palliative care, and contacting the patient's oncologist regarding further evaluation. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the disposition is to consider a lower extremity venous thromboembolism (PT) consult and transfer to the floor if she remains stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, further episodes of GI bleeding, progression of liver and adrenal lesions, worsening depression, and potential pulmonary embolism due to the history of clot and IVC clot."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with history of multiple malignancies and ureteral
   obstruction with hospital course complicated by LGIB felt to be likely
   related to colon CA and with need, however, for flex sig per GI rec's
   to further evaluate.
   1)Ureteral Obstruction-
   -Stent placed
   -Will need urology follow up to manage
   -Follow urine output and exam
   2)GI Bleed-Has not required transfusion for past 24 hours and has not
   had furthe bowel movements.  Has received enema this morning
   -Will continue to monitor HCT
   -GI for flex sig today possibly
but will have to consider yield in the
   setting of known rectal CA
   3)DVT/PE--Coumadin held in the setting of active GI bleeding noted.
   -Based on findings on lower GI evaluation will consider restart of
   coumadin
   -If no desire for flex sig then will provide empiric restart of
   coumadin
but will have to be carefully considered in light of the
   recent bleeding event.
   4)Colon Cancer-Will need to consider overall plan in concert with
   outside hospital oncologist who has been kept up to date.  Will have to
   provide a framework for planning of future treatment path and will
   enlist palliative care in the discussion and aid in treatment planning.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of multiple malignancies, including ureteral obstruction, colon cancer, and rectal cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB), which is likely related to her colon cancer. The patient also has a known rectal cancer. She underwent a stent placement for the ureteral obstruction and received an enema this morning. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/59 to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 102 K/uL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 111 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ureteral Obstruction: A stent was placed, and the patient will need urology follow-up to manage the condition. Urine output and examination should be monitored.
2. GI Bleed: The patient has not required transfusion for the past 24 hours and has not had further bowel movements. She received an enema this morning. HCT should be"
