","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for postoperative care after undergoing hindfoot fixation surgery. The patient presented with hypotension and a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to low hemoglobin levels, but the response was not adequate. Another 2 units of PRBCs were administered. The patient's borderline hypotension and tachycardia improved with blood transfusion. 

Allergies include Levofloxacin and Quinolones. Antibiotics given include ceftriaxone and vancomycin. 

The patient is currently on several medications including diltiazem, Advair, spiriva, albuterol/atrovent nebs, Zonegran, carbamazepine, sertraline, Neurontin, dilaudid PCA, ASA, simvastatin, and pain management with dilaudid PCA and PO. 

The patient has the following lab results: 

- Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.8 g/dL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 28.8%
- White blood cell count (WBC): 13.0 K/uL
- Platelet count (Plt): 309 K/uL

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 yo male with a history of COPD on home O2, CAD s/p CABG,
   and a.fib who presents with hypotension, hypoxia, and a.fib with RVR.
   #. Hypotension: Given his conjunctival pallor and the 500cc EBL, there
   is likely a large component of hypovolemia/anemia. However, must also
   consider an infectious etiology as well given frank pus in foley.
   However, his hypotension has largely resolved in the ICU without
   further intervention. Also must consider cardiac etiology given cardiac
   history.
   -Stat labs to check HCT, WBC, and creatinine
   -Insert Central line
   -Volume resuscitate with IVF and blood
   -Blood cultures and urine cultures
   -Check CEZ
   -Check EKG
   -Getting vancomycin periop, start ceftriaxone for presumptive UTI
   -Phenylephrine as needed
   -Hold PO carvedilol and PO lasix for now

   #. Hypoxia: Likely a combination of sedation and intrinsic COPD.
   Unlikely CHF given likely hypovolemia.
   -Ween O2 as tolerated
   -CXR to eval for ? pneumonia but no clinical signs at this time.
   -Con't Advair and spiriva
   -Standing albuterol and atrovent nebs

   #. A.fib: Currently in RVR. Likely an adrenergic component from
   hypovolemia.
   -Rescuscitate as above.
   -Holding PO carvedilol now given hypotension.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including COPD, CAD, and MS. He underwent left ankle fusion surgery and experienced intraoperative hypotension requiring neosynephrine. Postoperatively, he also had hypoxia and rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient has a Foley catheter with frank pus, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's 24-hour events include a multi-lumen central line placement and the administration of blood products due to ongoing blood loss and anemia. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, his heart rate dropped to the 90s. The patient's allergies include levofloxacin and quinolones, and he has received antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with a blood pressure of 101/57 mmHg and a heart rate of 98 bpm. His respiratory rate is normal, and his oxygen saturation is at 98% on a nasal cannula. He is in rapid atrial fibrillation, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range. The patient has received a total of 2,831 mL of fluids since midnight, including 2,757 mL of intravenous fluids. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, MS, CAD, and a.fib. He is currently in the ICU postoperatively after hindfoot fusion surgery. The patient presents with hypotension and a urinary tract infection (UTI). His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), blood pressure ranging from 104/57 mmHg to 83/43 mmHg, heart rate of 94 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been given various medications including vancomycin and ceftriaxone for the UTI, as well as other medications for his medical history such as COPD, CAD, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's urine culture shows growth of gram-negative rods, and he has been receiving fluids and blood transfusions as needed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible hypovolemia due to blood loss during surgery or sepsis caused by the UTI. The patient has been receiving fluids and blood transfusions to manage this condition.

2. UTI: The patient has a confirmed UTI, as indicated by the presence of gram-negative rods in his urine culture. He has been prescribed antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) to treat the infection.

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and atrial fibrillation (a.fib). He presents with hypotension and urinary tract infection (UTI) postoperatively. The patient's urine culture is growing gram-negative rods, and he has been de-escalated from tamsulosin. He has allergies to levofloxacin and quinolones. The patient received vancomycin and ceftriaxone as the last doses of antibiotics.

24-hour events include the growth of gram-negative rods in the urine culture, stable hemoglobin concentration, and discontinuation of tamsulosin. The patient has a history of allergies to levofloxacin and unknown allergens, with the last dose of antibiotics being vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

Infusions include fondaparinux, and other ICU medications are mentioned. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation, and central venous pressure is 10 mmHg.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, diabetes mellitus, mitral stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and trigeminal neuralgia. He underwent ankle fusion surgery and was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, which was initially attributed to blood loss and sepsis.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient's vital signs have been monitored closely. His temperature ranged from 36.3°C to 35.9°C, heart rate was stable between 87-110 bpm, blood pressure fluctuated between 70-115 mmHg, respiratory rate was within normal limits at 12-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remained at 99%. The patient's rhythm was atrial fibrillation (AF), and central venous pressure (CVP) was within normal range at 7-14 mmHg.

The patient received various medications, including dilaudid, tylenol, protonix, colace, SSI, neurontin, fondaparinux, sertraline, spiriva, flovent, and simvastatin. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin and ceftriaxone on 03/30/2126 at 02:00 PM and 10:00 PM respectively.

Review of Systems showed no significant changes except for the aforementioned conditions. Flowsheet data revealed fluid balance"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (a.fib), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He presents with hypotension and a urinary tract infection (UTI) postoperatively.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypovolemia due to blood loss but could also be experiencing septic shock given the UTI. His hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable, so there is no immediate need for transfusion. However, he required volume resuscitation with fluids yesterday and received 250cc today. Blood cultures and urine sensitivities are pending.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia resolved with improved pleth. He should continue with his current medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as Advair and Spiriva. Nebulized albuterol and atrovent should be continued as well.
3. Atrial fibrillation (a.fib): The patient's heart rhythm is currently controlled. He should hold oral carvedilol due to hypotension yesterday, and intravenous diltiazem can be used as needed for rate control.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The patient's oral diabetes medications should be held, and he should be covered with regular insulin sliding"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD post coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, and trigeminal neuralgia. The patient presents with hypotension and urinary tract infection postoperatively. 

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypertension, and trigeminal neuralgia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension, worsening of hypoxia, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, poor glycemic control, further bleeding from the hindfoot fixation, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and potential drug interactions or adverse effects. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte balance. Additionally, the dressing changes for the hindfoot fixation should be done carefully to prevent further bleeding. The patient's medication regimen should be reviewed to ensure appropriate management of his comorbidities and to minimize the risk of drug interactions or adverse effects."
