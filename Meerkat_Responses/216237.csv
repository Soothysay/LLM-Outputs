","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 39-year-old man who presented to the hospital after a fall while intoxicated. He is currently experiencing alcohol withdrawal and has been receiving Ativan and Valium to manage his symptoms. His last drink was on the evening of 3-16. The patient's Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score has risen acutely, indicating that he may be entering a phase of more active alcohol withdrawal soon.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/89 mmHg to 158/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. His blood glucose level is within normal range at 120 mg/dL.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is less shaky/tremulous than the previous evening. His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and his heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with regular rate and rhythm. The patient has tender abdomen but no rebound or guarding. There is mild ecchymosis at the right femoral site, but no bruit is present.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. However, the patient has mild hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male who presents with a chief complaint of EtOH withdrawal. The patient has been experiencing delirium tremens (DT), agitation, combativeness, spitting on the nurse, babbling, and incoherent speech. The patient's CIWA score ranges from 29-37. The patient has received a total of 15 mg of Valium orally and 35 mg of Valium intravenously, as well as 15 mg of Ativan intravenously and 25 mg of Haldol intravenously.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, for which he has not been consistently taking his prescribed medications. The patient also has allergies to penicillins, unknown; Ibuprofen, dyspepsia; Ketoconazole, unknown; and adhesive tape, rash.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 137 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 146/98 to 163/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates that he has received various medications, including heparin sodium, haloperidol, lorazepam, and diazepam. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,375 mL, with outputs totaling 2,105 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 99%.

Physical examination findings include the patient being incoherent, not oriented, and not following commands. The patient's neck is supple, and his lungs are clear bilaterally. The patient has mild echymosis at the right femoral site, no bruit, and no change from prior night. Other findings include tremulousness and soft, diffusely tender abdomen without rebound/guarding.

Laboratory results show the following values: WBC count of 6.3-8.0 thousand/mm3, Hct of 32.8-34.5%, platelet count of 97-122 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.5-0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 120-98 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances. Imaging reveals no evidence of an arteriovenous fistula.

Assessment and plan include alcohol withdrawal, pain control, alteration in nutrition, and a fall with intoxication. The patient is currently in DTs with a CIWA score ranging from 20-30. The patient will continue to receive IV Ativan or PO Valium every hour, as well as Haldol as needed for agitation. The patient will also receive multivitamins, folate, thiamine, and continue seizure precautions. Psychiatric consultation will be sought when the patient is more clinically stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old man who presented to the ICU with complaints of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTs). He has a history of alcohol abuse and falls. The patient is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal with IV Ativan and PO Valium. He also received Haldol as needed for agitation. The patient is receiving MVI, folate, and thiamine supplementation. Seizure precautions are in place, and the patient's needs for four-point restraints will be reassessed. A psych consult is requested when the patient is more clinically stable. The patient's home psychiatric medications (Prozac, Seroquel, Risperdal) are being held.

The patient had a C-collar applied due to concerns of cervical spine injury, but it was removed the following day after a CT scan showed no malalignment or fracture. The patient has a right femoral hematoma, which occurred while the patient had a femoral triple lumen catheter in place. A vascular ultrasound was performed, which did not reveal any AV fistula. The patient may be experiencing abdominal pain related to alcohol withdrawal, but further evaluation is needed, especially considering pancreatitis as a potential cause. The patient's abdominal pain has improved today.

Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit and platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkal"

He is currently showing signs of significant alcohol withdrawal and has a history of past delirium tremens (DT's) when discontinuing EtOH.

The patient started developing DT's overnight with a CIWA score high 20s. He was given 15 po and 35 IV valium, 15 IV ativan, and 25mg IV haldol. Despite being on 4-point restraints, he remained incoherent. The patient also has IV access and is receiving fluids.

An ultrasound was performed to rule out an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, which came back negative. The patient has several allergies, including penicillins, ibuprofen, and adhesive tape.

The patient is currently on multiple infusions and medications for prophylaxis, including heparin sodium, haloperidol (Haldol), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).

The patient is a 39-year-old male with severe and chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the MICU 24 hours after his last alcohol consumption. He is experiencing significant signs of withdrawal and has a history of past delirium tremens. The patient started delirium tremens overnight with a CIWA score high 20s. He was given 15 po and 35 IV Valium, 15 IV Ativan, and 25mg IV Haldol. Despite being on 4-point restraints, he remains incoherent. The patient has IV access and an ultrasound to rule out an arteriovenous fistula, which showed no fistula. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is showing severe signs of withdrawal, which can progress to more serious complications such as seizures and delirium tremens. Close monitoring and administration of appropriate medications, such as benzodiazepines, are crucial to prevent these complications.

2. Bicarbonate-Low (normal range): The patient's low bicarbonate level indicates a metabolic acidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could be due to renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal issues, or other metabolic disturbances. Monitoring and correcting the acid-base balance is essential.

3. Abdominal Pain: Although the patient's abdominal pain has resolved, it is important to monitor for any recurrence or worsening symptoms. This could indicate an underlying gastrointestinal condition that needs further investigation and management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male in the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has a history of alcoholism and is currently experiencing delirium tremens (DTs), acute and chronic pain, and alterations in nutrition. Vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. Fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 730 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows normal blood pressure and heart rhythm. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, haloperidol (Haldol), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan). Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic function, and movement. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt levels, and abnormal PT/PTT/INR values. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium Tremens (DTs): The patient's alcohol withdrawal symptoms have progressed to delirium tremens, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source and appropriate treatment.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The decreased platelet count may increase the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 39-year-old male with severe and chronic alcohol abuse.
- He was admitted to the MICU after falling and showing signs of alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient has a history of past delirium tremens (DTs) during alcohol detoxification.
- He started experiencing DTs overnight, with a CIWA score ranging from high 20s to high 30s.
- The patient received medications including 15 po and 35 IV valium, 15 IV ativan, and 25mg IV haldol.
- He was still incoherent and restrained.
- The patient has an IV access line, and an ultrasound was performed to rule out an arteriovenous (AV) fistula.
- He has multiple allergies and is on various medications including heparin, haloperidol, diazepam, lorazepam, thiamine, folic acid, MVI, colace, propanolol, PPI, hep SQ, seroquel, zophran, and tylenol PRN.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for being delirious.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/96 to 105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient's blood flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.
- Physical examination findings include agitation, mild tremulousness, orientation to name only, clear opacities, regular heart sounds, clear lung auscultation bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no extremity changes.
- The patient's labs indicate normal results for WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, Glucose, and other electrolyte levels, but slightly elevated PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 levels.
- Assessment and plan include management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, low bicarbonate levels, abdominal pain, femoral hematoma, bipolar disorder, and potential nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for severe complications associated with alcohol withdrawal, including seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and potential cardiovascular and central nervous system dysfunction.
2. Thiamine Deficiency: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, which may result in Wernicke's encephalopathy or beriberi.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show slightly elevated levels of certain electrolytes, indicating a potential risk for electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT formation.
6. Femoral Hematoma: The patient's femoral hematoma requires further evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with severe and chronic EtOH abuse admitted to the MICU for alcohol withdrawal symptoms after stopping alcohol consumption. He has a history of past delirium tremens (DT's). The patient experienced a fall but had no acute intracranial process identified. He is currently in the ICU, displaying signs of severe alcohol withdrawal and agitation. The patient has been started on IV access and various medications including diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and haloperidol (Haldol) for sedation and control of withdrawal symptoms. He is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and has undergone an ultrasound to rule out an arteriovenous (AV) fistula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
2) Bicarbonate-Low: The patient has low bicarbonate levels, indicating possible metabolic acidosis. This could be due to ketoacidosis or another underlying condition.
3) Abdominal Pain: Although the patient's abdominal pain has resolved, it is important to monitor for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications.
4) Femoral Hematoma: The patient has a femoral hematoma, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5) Bipolar Disorder: The patient's bipolar disorder requires"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male who presented to the hospital after a fall while intoxicated. He is currently in the ICU for alcohol withdrawal and is being treated with benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medication. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and has not been compliant with his psychiatric medications. He is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, possibly due to alcoholic ketoacidosis, and his serum sodium level has dropped slightly. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, kefzol, ibuprofen, ketoconazole, adhesive tape, shellfish, and angioedema. He is currently receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT and stress ulcer medication. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is still agitated and has garbled speech. His recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels. The patient's recent imaging studies did not reveal any significant findings. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Continued alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures or delirium tremens.
2. Benzodiazepine intoxication or overdose.
3. Metabolic acidosis progressing to severe complications like shock or organ failure.
4. Pancreatitis due to alcohol withdrawal.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from the femoral triple lumen catheter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male who presented to the ICU after falling while intoxicated. He is experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including agitation and delirium tremens. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have garbled speech. His lab results show metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level and low bicarbonate level, suggesting alcoholic ketoacidosis. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, but he has not been compliant with his psychiatric medications. He also has an abdominal pain that could be related to alcohol withdrawal or pancreatitis, although his lipase levels are normal. There is a concern for a possible femoral hematoma due to the femoral triple lumen catheter. The patient's neck pain has not been ruled out for a fracture, so he is still wearing a C-collar. The patient's disposition will remain in the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes. The patient is already showing signs of delirium tremens, including agitation and garbled speech.
2. Alcoholic ketoacidosis: The patient's lab results indicate the presence of ketones in his urine, suggesting alcoholic ketoacidosis. This condition can lead to metabolic acidosis and may require intervention.
3. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's lipase levels are normal, there is still a concern for pancreatitis given the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old man who experienced a fall while intoxicated. He is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal, which includes the use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medication. The patient also has metabolic acidosis and is suspected to have alcoholic ketoacidosis, as evidenced by the presence of ketones in his urine. 

Additionally, the patient complains of abdominal pain, which could be related to alcohol withdrawal or pancreatitis. However, his lipase levels are normal, and a CT scan of the abdomen did not reveal any significant findings. 

The patient also has a history of a bipolar disorder and is not currently on any psychiatric medication. His neck pain cannot be ruled out as a fracture, and he has a femoral hematoma that occurred while he had a femoral triple lumen catheter in place. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within the normal range, a heart rate within the normal range, blood pressure within the normal range, respiratory rate within the normal range, and oxygen saturation at 96%. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes (ALT, AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 

Overall, the patient's medical complications include alcohol withdrawal, potential alcoholic ketoacidosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male who presented to the ICU after experiencing a fall while intoxicated. He is currently undergoing treatment for alcohol withdrawal, which includes the administration of IV lorazepam and oral diazepam as needed. The patient also requires pain control, and there are concerns about possible pancreatitis, although his lipase levels are normal. The patient's neck cannot be cleared yet due to complaints of pain, and a cervical collar has been placed. He has a femoral hematoma that occurred during the placement of a femoral triple lumen catheter, which is being monitored daily. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, but his psychiatric medications have been withheld for now. He is also experiencing hypokalemia, which is being treated with potassium supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens (DTs): The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, and it is important to closely monitor for the development of seizures or DTs.
2. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's lipase levels are normal, there is still a possibility of pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse. Monitoring for abdominal pain and assessing pancreatic enzymes would be necessary.
3. Neck fracture: Despite the CT scan not showing any malalignment or fracture, the patient's complaints of pain indicate that the neck cannot be completely cleared yet. Continuous monitoring and further imaging may be required to rule out any underlying neck injury.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with severe and chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU after a fall. He was admitted 24 hours after his last alcohol intake and showed significant signs of withdrawal. The patient has a history of past delirium tremens when alcohol was discontinued. 

The patient received increasing doses of benzodiazepines (Ativan, Haldo, and Valium) to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He also received other medications including thiamine, folate, MVI, colace, propanolol, PPI, hep SQ, Seroquel, zophran, and tylenol as needed.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/84 mmHg to 146/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is normal and he has clear lungs. 

On examination, the patient is very sedated, oriented to his name only, with minimal tremulousness. His neurologic examination is unremarkable except for mild tremor. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose levels, and electrolyte levels. However, the patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin level, and slightly elevated creatinine level"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with severe and chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU after a fall. He was admitted 24 hours after his last alcohol intake and is showing signs of severe withdrawal, with a history of past delirium tremens (DTs). The patient received benzodiazepines and haloperidol for delirium and DTs. Thiamine, folate, and MVI supplements were given, and CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) score was >10. Lorazepam and diazepam infusions were administered, along with heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications included propanolol, PPI, hep SQ (Seroquel spit out), zophran prn, and tylenol prn. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is very sedated and has minimal tremulousness. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,860 mL, with total output of 1,860 mL. The patient's labs indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and low potassium levels (K+). The patient's condition has improved since admission, with resolved abdominal pain and femoral hematoma. The assessment includes alcohol withdrawal, resolved DTs, resolved abdominal pain, femoral hematoma, and bipolar disorder. The plan involves continuing with haldol and benzo therapy for alcohol withdrawal, monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with signs and symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens and seizures. The patient is also experiencing acute and chronic pain, as well as alterations in nutrition. Vital signs are within normal limits, with the exception of a low-grade fever. The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. Laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function. The patient is receiving multiple medications for pain control, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal. It is important to monitor for any signs of recurrent seizures and ensure appropriate anticonvulsant therapy is continued.
2. Delirium tremens: The patient may be at risk for further episodes of delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. Close monitoring for changes in mental status and vital signs is necessary.
3. Infection: Given the patient's altered immune status and prolonged hospitalization, there is an increased risk of hospital-acquired infections such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections. Strict infection control"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU after a fall while intoxicated. He is currently undergoing treatment for alcohol withdrawal, pain management, and nutritional support. 

The patient has been receiving benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and haloperidol for agitation. Valium is being continued if the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score is greater than 10. Multivitamins, folate, and thiamine are also being administered daily.

The patient is also being monitored for metabolic acidosis, which is believed to be due to alcoholic ketoacidosis. Bicarbonate levels are being trended daily, and feeding is being continued.

The patient's abdominal pain is a concern, as it could be related to alcohol withdrawal or pancreatitis. Liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels are normal, and a CT scan of the abdomen did not reveal any specific cause. The possible location of a subcutaneous heparin shot is also being investigated.

The patient's neck pain is thought to be musculoskeletal, as a CT scan of the neck showed no malalignment or fracture. His right femoral hematoma is being monitored, as it occurred in the setting of a femoral triple lumen catheter.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, but his psychiatric medications (Prozac, Seroquel, and Risperdal) have not been filled, and he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old male who presented to the ICU after falling while intoxicated. He is currently experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including agitation and garbled speech. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure and heart rate. His oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient has received multiple doses of Ativan for agitation and Haldol for delirium tremens.

The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His electrolytes are mostly within normal limits, but his BUN and creatinine levels are slightly elevated. His liver function tests are normal, as well as his amylase and lipase levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of alcohol withdrawal, pain control, and alteration in nutrition. The medical team is considering the possibility of alcoholic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, and femoral hematoma. They also note the patient's history of bipolar disorder and the need for psychiatric consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcoholic ketoacidosis: The patient has ketones in his urine, suggesting alcoholic ketoacidosis. It is important to monitor his bicarbonate levels and continue to trend daily bicarb. Providing appropriate nutrition and avoiding hypoglycemia can also help in managing this condition.

2. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's lipase and amylase levels are normal, abdominal pain could be related to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and confusion. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently in the ICU for close monitoring. The patient has been experiencing fluctuations in vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. He is receiving various medications for pain control, alcohol withdrawal, and nutrition support. The patient's lab results show abnormal values in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. X-rays were taken on 03/18, 03/19 (twice), 03/20 (twice), and 03/21.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient's history of alcohol abuse and altered mental status suggest the possibility of DTs, which can be a life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal.
2. Seizures: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and altered mental status, there is a risk of seizures, which can be associated with alcohol withdrawal.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate an ongoing infection, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
4. Hypoglycemia: The fluctuating blood glucose levels require careful monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes may suggest liver dysfunction, which needs further evaluation and management.
