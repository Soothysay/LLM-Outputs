   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.

   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Start integrillin gtt with bolus given large CK leak and prolonged
   symptoms.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s.
   - Aspirin, plavix load
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery
   - Repeat EKG in the AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, artificial joint implantation, hypertension, and recent left hip revision surgery. He developed chest pain during the peri-operative period and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after the surgery. The patient was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 mmHg to 125/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, troponin T, and cardiac enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient developed chest pain in the peri-operative setting and was diagnosed with NSTEMI. Risk factors include hypertension, and the patient has known aortic stenosis. It is possible that the MI occurred due to increased demand in the setting of surgery. The patient is currently chest pain-free.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip
   revision on [**3-8**] who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48
   hrs after L hip revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   workup.  Has remained chest pain free since admission.
   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Now that he has been given plavix load, will stop integrillin.
   Restart if recurrent chest pain.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s,
   TID dosing.  Also treat anxiety with ativan which may improve HR.
   - Aspirin, plavix daily
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes.  CK peak last night at 1154.
   - Follow hct as patient is s/p hip surgery.  Slightly down today.
   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU
   - Cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if CP recurs, cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend up.
   .
   # Chest pain: Also on differential includes PE vs ACS which is
   described above.  Patient is tachycardic, but not really hypoxic.
   However clinical setting would work ie post op hip with sudden onset
   chest pain.
   - CT chest to rule out PE.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - ACS work up as above.
   .
   # Nose bleed: Packed here but patient has bleeding noted posteriorly.
   - Consult ENT for proper nasal packing.  Saline spray.
   .
   #. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram on Monday.
   .
   #. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. s/p L hip repair: Failed hip arthroplasty s/p revision on [**3-8**].
   Reportedly was doing well from that perspective.  Ambulated with PT
   today without difficulty.  Still with some pain with transferring.
   - Heparin gtt for DVT ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and hypertension who underwent left hip revision surgery on [**3-8**]. He developed chest pain today, which was found to be consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) occurring 48 hours after the surgery. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating a possible risk of acute kidney injury, especially considering the recent surgery and potential decreased renal perfusion.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are slightly below normal, and he is on supplemental oxygen. This could indicate an underlying respiratory issue, such as pneumonia, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for developing DVT due to recent surgery, immobility, and potential hypercoagulability state associated with NSTEMI. Heparin gtt has been started for DVT prophylaxis.
4. Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) and has experienced episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) since admission. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and adjustment of beta-block"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Insufficiency (AI), hypertension, and a recent left hip revision surgery. He presented with chest pain and was found to have Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after the surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving treatment for his cardiac condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has developed chest pain and positive cardiac markers, indicating a possible myocardial infarction. This could lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to recent surgery and immobilization. Heparin gtt has been started for prophylaxis.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AS and AI, which can predispose him to atrial fibrillation. Monitoring on telemetry is recommended to detect any episodes.
4. Heart Failure: Given the patient's known reduced ejection fraction (EF 50%) and recent myocardial insult, there is a risk of developing heart failure. Monitoring fluid balance and administering appropriate medications will be crucial.
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's risk factors include recent surgery and immobilization, which increases the likelihood of developing a PE. Monitoring for symptoms and considering"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, hypertension, and recent left hip revision surgery. He presented with chest pain and was found to have NSTEMI 48 hours after the surgery. He was transferred to the cath lab for further evaluation and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has symptoms consistent with ACS, including chest pain and elevated cardiac markers. Immediate management includes continuing heparin infusion and conducting an ACS workup.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although a CTA was negative, there is still a possibility of PE due to the patient's recent surgery and immobilization. Close monitoring and consideration of alternative diagnostic tests may be necessary.

3. Nosebleed: The patient experienced a nosebleed that required packing. Further evaluation by ENT is recommended to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and a low ejection fraction of 50%. Regular monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is important. Repeat echocardiogram on Monday is planned.

5. Arrhythmias: The patient had one episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) since admission. Continued monitoring on telemetry and titration of beta-blocker therapy as tolerated are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and artificial insemination (AI), hypertension (HTN), and left hip revision surgery. He presented with chest pain and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after the surgery. He was transferred to the cardiology service and is currently in the catheterization lab. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has developed a post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) due to increased exertion and demand related to AS and anemia with low post-operative hematocrit (HCT) levels.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient is experiencing chest pain, and ACS is a likely etiology. Pulmonary embolism has been ruled out with a negative computed tomography angiography (CTA). Further assessment will be done after the catheterization procedure.
3. Nose bleed: The patient had a nose bleed that was initially packed but still has posterior bleeding. The patient will be followed up with by the ENT department and his HCT levels.
4. Heart failure (HF): The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 50% on the last echocardiogram, indicating reduced cardiac function. The patient appears euvolemic on examination but requires mild oxygen supplementation.
5. Arrhythmia:"

   .
   #. CAD: Patient developed chest pain in peri-operative setting (48hrs
   out) and found to have positive cardiac markers.  Patient has known AS
   so MI possibly demand in this setting.  He was also noted to be anemic
   post-operatively.  Risk factors include hypertension.  Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG with LBBB which is old, difficult to assess.  Telemetry
   also demonstrated some NSVT since arrival.
   - Continue with heparin gtt which was started at OSH.
   - Now that he has been given plavix load, will stop integrillin.
   Restart if recurrent chest pain.
   - Continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated to goal HR 60-70s,
   TID dosing.  Also treat anxiety with ativan which may improve HR.
   - Aspirin, plavix daily
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes.  CK peak last night at 1154.

   - Monitor on telemetry in CCU
   - Cardiac catheterization on Monday or sooner if CP recurs, cardiac
   enzymes continue to trend up.

   described above.  Patient is tachycardic, but not really hypoxic.
   However clinical setting would work ie post op hip with sudden onset
   chest pain.
   - CT chest to rule out PE.

The patient has been transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further evaluation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient developed chest pain in the peri-operative setting and was found to have positive cardiac markers, indicating an ACS. The patient has known aortic stenosis, which may have contributed to the myocardial infarction in this setting. 
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to recent hip surgery. Heparin gtt has been started for DVT prophylaxis.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Chest pain can also be attributed to PE, and a CT chest is planned to rule out PE.
4. Anemia: The patient was noted to be anemic post-operatively. 
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 111/52 to 131/66 mmHg. 
6. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been relatively stable, ranging from 82 to 104 bpm. 
7. Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB): The patient's EKG shows an old LBBB, making it difficult to assess for new ischemia. Telemetry has demonstrated some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) since admission. 
8. Nasal Bleeding: The patient experienced a nosebleed, which was initially packed. However, bleeding was noted posteriorly, and consultation with ENT for proper nasal packing is recommended. 

Plan:
1. Continue with heparin gtt for ACS and DVT prophylaxis.
2. Stop integrillin once Plavix load is given and restart if recurrent chest pain.
3. Titrate beta blocker up as tolerated to goal heart rate of 60-70s, TID dosing. Treat anxiety with ativan to improve heart rate.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension (HTN), and previous left hip revision surgery. He presented with chest pain today and was found to have non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after his left hip revision surgery. He was transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's NSTEMI suggests underlying CAD, which could lead to further cardiac complications if not managed appropriately.

2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain is likely due to ACS, and the etiology is most likely related to increased exertion and demand, possibly aggravated by the peri-operative setting and anemia with low post-operative hematocrit (HCT) levels.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the CT angiography (CTA) was negative, there is still a possibility of PE. Close monitoring and further assessment will be necessary to rule out this condition.

4. Nose bleed: The patient had a nose bleed that was initially packed, but bleeding was noted posteriorly. It is important to follow the recommendations of the ENT specialist and monitor the patient's HCT levels.

5. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities: The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm but experienced one episode of nonsustained ventricular"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and angina who underwent left hip revision surgery. Postoperatively, he developed chest pain and was found to have NSTEMI. He was transferred to the cardiology service and underwent PCI. Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe aortic stenosis and three-vessel coronary artery disease. Due to these findings, he was referred to cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). 

The patient has been in the ICU since [**2114-3-10**] and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/45 to 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has been in normal sinus rhythm since transfer but had periprocedure atrial fibrillation which has resolved. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a late peaking systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, along with a soft S2. His peripheral pulses are 2+ and he has no foot drop. The left hip hematoma is dress-coded and there are surrounding ecchymoses. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated troponin-T, and abnormal liver function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multivessel coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, and severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe aortic valve disease and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient also has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe aortic stenosis: This condition can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and syncope. If left untreated, it can progress to heart failure and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.
2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension: This condition can lead to right ventricular failure and pulmonary edema. It can also result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased exercise tolerance.
3. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction: This condition can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and pulmonary edema. It can lead to heart failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Procedure-related atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications. It may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
5. Mild mitral regurgitation: This condition can lead to volume overload in the left atrium and ventr"

   Cardiac cath:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe aortic stenosis (although [**Location (un) 342**] cannot be calculated with
   confidence given known aortic regurgitation).
   3. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   4. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   5. Procedure-related atrial fibrillation. Given severity of diastolic
   heart failure and aortic valve disease, recommendation is to pursue
   elective cardioversion in the CCU.
   6. Cardiac surgery consultation for suitability for AVR-CABG.
   .
   TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
   basal half of the inferolateral wall, distal half of the anteroseptal
   and anterior walls, and apex. The remaining segments contract well
   (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets and supporting structures
   are mildly fibrotic. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

   76 year old male with history of AS/AI, HTN s/p L hip revision on [**3-8**]
   who developed chest pain today found to have NSTEMI 48 hrs after L hip
   revision ([**3-8**]), transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] and now in the cath lab.
   .
   #. CAD: Pt transferred to cardiology service with post-op MI in setting
   of increased exertion and demand. Etiology thought likely related to
   peri-operative setting, demand related to AS, and demand related to
   anemia with low post-op HCTs.
   -          cath lab today
   -          continue beta blocker, plavix, aspirin
   -          restart ACEI once returns from cath
    .
   2. Chest pain: Etiology is most likely ACS. Pulmonary embolism is
   unlikely given negative CTA. Will reassess after cath
   - Continue heparin gtt for now, will have received 48 hours at 8pm
   - ACS work up as above.
   .
   3. Nose bleed: Packed here but patient has bleeding noted posteriorly.
   - appreciate ENT recs
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   4. Pump: EF 50% on last echocardiogram, appears euvolemic on exam with
   mild O2 requirement.
   - Repeat echocardiogram
   - maintain even
   .
   5. Rhythm: Normal sinus rhythm, one episode of NSVT since admission.
   - Continue beta blocker, titrate up as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   6. s/p L hip repair: Failed hip arthroplasty s/p revision on [**3-8**].
   Reportedly was doing well from that perspective.  Ambulated with PT
   today without difficulty.  Still with some pain with transferring.
   - Heparin gtt for DVT ppx then will change to Hep SC. Will need to
   discuss post op anticoag with ortho. ?needs lovenox
   - Pain control PRN
   - PT once patient is cleared from cardiac perspective.
   - Discuss with Ortho regarding appropriate post-operative care.

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and artificial insemination, hypertension, and hip revision surgery.
- He presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) 48 hours after his hip revision surgery.
- He was transferred to the cardiology service and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, and severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
- The patient also experienced procedure-related atrial fibrillation and was advised to pursue elective cardioversion in the critical care unit (CCU).
- A cardiac surgery consultation was recommended for suitability for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patient's echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, severe aortic valve stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation.
- Vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.
