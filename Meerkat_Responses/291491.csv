","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and aspiration. She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/63 mmHg to 144/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a fluid balance of -703 mL. She is receiving multiple medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam, famotidine, lorazepam, furosemide, and heparin sodium.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and mild confusion. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 163 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 110 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and diminished breath sounds on the right side suggest a possible respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and ensuring proper ventilation support is crucial.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis. She presents after an aspiration event and has a history of chronic aspiration risk. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation, receiving medications through a PICC line, and is being given IV ativan with good effect. Her allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. She is in atrial fibrillation. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 67 mL and output of 770 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 703 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including famotidine, lorazepam, furosemide, and heparin sodium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient has a known chronic aspiration risk and was recently involved in an aspiration event. This increases her risk for further aspiration and associated complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which is likely due to worsening right pleural effusion or aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. This requires close monitoring and management to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying severe COPD may worsen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who presented after an aspiration event. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient has a known chronic aspiration risk and is currently on a soft dysphagia diet. She has had previous aspiration events and is now strict NPO (nothing by mouth). The family is discussing the option of inserting a nasogastric (NG) tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for long-term feeding.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing worsening right pleural effusion and aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. These conditions are contributing to her underlying COPD and kyphoscoliosis. She requires CPAP at night and oxygen supplementation to maintain saturation levels between 89-92%.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient is on home oxygen therapy (3-4L at baseline) and is currently experiencing a COPD exacerbation. She requires continued use of atrovent/albuterol nebs.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin. Her INR is at 1.4, indicating she is rate-controlled but unable to take her home beta-blocker. She will restart warfarin after a decision regarding the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who presents after an aspiration event. She has a history of chronic aspiration risk and is unable to take oral medications. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving non-invasive ventilation at home and has been given IV ativan for agitation at night.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the right side, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and mildly distended abdomen. She is confused and asking questions but is oriented to person. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine level. Her electrolytes are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several conditions that require attention. Firstly, she has aspiration pneumonia due to her known chronic aspiration risk. She is currently strict NPO and will require further discussion regarding the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Social work and palliative care consultations have been ordered.

Secondly, the patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely due to worsening right pleural effusion or aspiration"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, kyphoscoliosis who
   presents after aspiration event.
   # Aspiration: Patient with known chronic aspiration risk, unable to
   take PO meds at [**Hospital1 189**].  She gets confused during attempts to explain
   what has happened during her aspiration events likely due to her
   baseline dementia. Had S&S study in [**3-3**] with recommendation for soft
   dysphagia diet.
   - Strict NPO for now
   - Continue IV meds
   - Family discussion for ?NG tube v. PEG v. or allowing chronic
   aspiration.
   - SW and palliative care consult for ?hospice as this was discussed on
   her last admission but not formally addressed.
   # Hypoxia: Etiology is most likely worsening right pleural effusion vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Underlying COPD, kyphoscoliosis
   contributing. ABG with improved hypercarbia from baseline on
   presentation (pCO2 68); requires CPAP at night.
   - Recheck ABG this AM
   - O2 supplementation to maintain sats 89-92%
   - Continue coverage for health-care associated with vanc/zosyn; recheck
   vanc trough in AM
   # COPD on home O2 (3-4L at baseline): Currently, Bicarb is at her
   baseline suggesting no CO2 retention. Likely with restrictive
   physiology.
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   - O2 supplementation as above
   # A fib on coumadin: INR of 1.4 and she is currently rate controlled,
   but unable to take her home po BB.
   - Restart warfarin after decision about PEG tube.
   - Metoprolol IV PRN for tachycardia.
   # Acute on chronic Diastolic heart failure: TTE from [**10/2195**] showed EF
   of 70-80% with Mild PAH and significant pulmonic regurg.
   - IV lasix PRN as she will be NPO but getting fluid with IV med/abx

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis. She presents after an aspiration event and has a history of chronic aspiration risk. The patient is unable to take oral medications and becomes confused during attempts to explain her aspiration events, likely due to her baseline dementia. She had a swallowing study in the past with a recommendation for a soft dysphagia diet. The patient is currently on strict NPO status, receiving IV medications, and is being considered for a nasogastric (NG) tube versus percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or allowing chronic aspiration. Social work and palliative care consults have been ordered.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxia, with an etiology that is most likely worsening right pleural effusion versus aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Her underlying COPD and kyphoscoliosis are contributing factors. The patient requires CPAP at night, and her oxygen saturation should be maintained between 89-92%. Antibiotic coverage for health-care associated infections with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) should be continued, with rechecking the vancomycin trough in the morning.

The patient has a history of COPD and is on home oxygen therapy (3-4L at baseline). Her current bicarbonate level is at her baseline, suggesting no CO2 retention. She likely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis. She presented after an aspiration event and has a known chronic aspiration risk. The family has decided against placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube but has not made a decision about further hospitalizations or hospice care.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, possibly due to worsening right pleural effusion or aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. She requires continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night and supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation levels between 89-92%. Her blood gases show improved hypercarbia from baseline.

The patient also has restrictive lung disease and COPD, for which she is receiving bronchodilator nebs as needed and supplemental oxygen. Her atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, but she cannot take oral beta-blockers.

She has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 70-80% and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and significant pulmonic regurgitation, as shown on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) from October 2195.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's chronic aspiration risk and recent aspiration event, she is at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and potentially worsen her underlying"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis. She presents after an aspiration event and is currently unable to take oral medications due to confusion during attempts to explain her aspiration events, likely due to baseline dementia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation overnight per her home schedule and has received 0.5 of IV ativan with good effect. She has also been restarted on PO diltiazem but missed her PM dose, which led to agitation. Additionally, she is being given IV lasix at home dose but via IV (30/20). The patient's ABGs show low PO2 consistently but only on ventilator mask 30%. FiO2 has been increased, and ABG is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's known chronic aspiration risk, inability to take PO meds, and previous recommendation for a soft dysphagia diet, there is a potential for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's worsening right pleural effusion, underlying COPD, and kyphoscoliosis contribute to her hypoxia. Ongoing oxygen supplementation is necessary to maintain sats 89-92%.

3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to her baseline condition, restrictive physiology, and home O2 use.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who presents after an aspiration event. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation at home settings. The family has decided against a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube but has not made a decision about further hospitalizations versus hospice care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/64 mmHg to 143/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,190 mL with 114 mL output, resulting in a deficit of 400 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with set tidal volume of 0 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 622 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, sodium of 162 mg/dL, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, glucose of 110 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include the following:
1. Aspiration: The patient has a known chronic aspiration risk and had a swallowing study in the past with recommendations for a soft dysphagia diet. The family has decided against PEG tube placement, and no decision has been made about further hospitalizations or hospice care.
2. Hypoxia: The etiology is likely worsening right pleural effusion or aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Underlying restrictive lung disease/COPD and kyphoscoliosis contribute to the hypoxia. The patient requires CPAP at night.
3. Restrictive lung disease vs COPD on home O2: The patient is currently on home O2 (3-4L at baseline) and is likely experiencing restrictive physiology. O2 supplementation and atrovent/albuterol nebs are recommended.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is off coumadin with an INR of 1.4. Metoprolol IV is administered for tachycardia.
5. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: A transthoracic echocardiogram from October 2195 showed an ejection fraction of 70-80% with mild pulmonary arterial hypertension and significant pulmonic regurgitation. IV lasix"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who presents after an aspiration event. The family has decided against a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube but has not made a decision about further hospitalizations versus hospice. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been given IV lorazepam for agitation. She is being transitioned back to oral medications and has missed her evening dose of diltiazem. Lasix was restarted at home doses but will be continued at IV levels. The patient's arterial blood gases (ABGs) show low oxygen levels consistently but only on ventilator mask 30%. Increased FiO2 and ABG pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient has a known chronic aspiration risk and had a previous swallowing study recommending a soft dysphagia diet. The family's decision against PEG tube placement may increase the risk of malnutrition and further aspiration events.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels on ventilator mask 30% suggest potential respiratory compromise. Worsening right pleural effusion, aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, underlying restrictive lung disease, and COPD are contributing factors.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, currently euvolemic. She has a history of mild PAH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who presents after an aspiration event. She has a history of chronic aspiration risk and has undergone a swallowing study with recommendations for a soft dysphagia diet. The family has not made a decision regarding further hospitalizations or hospice care. The patient is currently on a dysphagia diet with aspiration precautions and may need to be discharged to Hospital1 with plans to transition to hospice. The patient requires O2 supplementation to maintain sats at 89-92% and is being treated for health-care associated pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to her chronic aspiration risk and recent aspiration event. This increases the likelihood of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's restrictive lung disease and COPD could lead to respiratory failure, especially if she experiences worsening hypoxia or an exacerbation of her COPD.
3. Diastolic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's acute on chronic diastolic heart failure may worsen, leading to fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and advanced age. Prophylactic measures are in place, but close monitoring is necessary.
