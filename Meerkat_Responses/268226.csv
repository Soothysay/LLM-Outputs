   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free with plan for
   cardiac catheterization in a.m.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt
   - check lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - check echocardiogram
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - check A1c
   - repeat ECG tomorrow
   - possible cardiac cath in a.m. though at higher risk for mechanical
   complications with reperfusion
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior
   MI.  Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload
   - start dopamine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - ECHO
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure, K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Likely acute on chronic
   given kidney dysfunction.
   - 1 amp sodium bicarb now
   - kayexalate given in ED
   - repeat K and EKG in a.m.
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to uremia, lactate,
   - check lactate
   - UA for ketones
   - serum tox for salicylates
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.

   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: restart oxycodone once dose confirmed
   .
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, and a massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).

The patient currently has the following medical conditions:
1. STEMI: Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with STEMI, likely in the inferior region. The patient is chest pain-free and plans for cardiac catheterization in the morning.
2. Hypotension: Likely secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure in the setting of inferior MI. Other possible causes include hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.
3. Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 on admission and peaked T waves on EKG in lateral leads. This is likely acute on chronic given kidney dysfunction.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Secondary to uremia, lactate, etc.
5. Anemia: Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive contents in ileostomy.
6. Pulmonary embolism/DVT: Not on coumadin because of history of GI bleed. IVC filter in place.
7. Osteoarthritis: Restart oxycodone once dose confirmed.
8. Sacral and foot decubitus: Would care consult.
9. DVT prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, PPI.
10. FEN (likely referring to feeding): IVFs as above, NPO (nothing by mouth) for now.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
- Mechanical complications with reperfusion during cardiac catheterization.
- Cardiogenic shock due to LV dysfunction.
- Worsening renal function leading to further hyperkalemia.
- Progression of anion gap metabolic acidosis.
- Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.
- Pressure ulcers (decubitus ulcers).
- Malnutrition and poor glycemic control due to NPO status and inadequate nutrition.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's medical conditions and potential complications based on the provided information. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and management plan for the patient."

The patient will be managed medically with the following medications: ASA 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, heparin gtt (to be stopped tomorrow), atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and holding beta blockers due to hypotension. An echocardiogram should be checked, and consideration should be given to initiating an ACE inhibitor when blood pressure is tolerated. A1c levels should be checked, and an EKG should be repeated tomorrow. The goals of care should be discussed with the family.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure in the setting of inferior MI. Hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction should also be considered. The plan includes IV fluids as needed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, previous pulmonary embolism with an IVC filter, and massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of STEMI. 

The patient has positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with an inferior STEMI. Due to the patient's age and poor baseline functionality, percutaneous coronary thrombosis (PCTA) is not recommended, and the patient will be managed medically. The patient is currently chest pain-free.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 80/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 

The patient has a history of anemia with iron deficiency and received a transfusion of 1 unit of red blood cells. The patient also has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.7 on admission and peaked T waves on EKG. 

The patient has several medical complications including hypotension likely secondary to right ventricular failure in the setting of inferior MI, anion gap metabolic acidosis likely from poor perfusion due to congestive heart failure after STEMI, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free with plan for
   cardiac catheterization in a.m.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt
   - check lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - check echocardiogram
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - check A1c
   - repeat ECG tomorrow
   - possible cardiac cath in a.m. though at higher risk for mechanical
   complications with reperfusion
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior
   MI.  Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload
   - start dopamine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - ECHO
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure, K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Likely acute on chronic
   given kidney dysfunction.
   - 1 amp sodium bicarb now
   - kayexalate given in ED
   - repeat K and EKG in a.m.
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to uremia, lactate,
   - check lactate
   - UA for ketones
   - serum tox for salicylates
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.
   - pantoprazole iv
   - continue to monitor hct
   - consider transfusion 1u PRBC
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: restart oxycodone once dose confirmed
   .
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   .
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt, PPI
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, NPO for now
   # CODE: full, discussed with family. They understand that he has a poor
   prognosis.
   # COMM:
   # DISPO: CCU for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, and a massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented with chest pain and was transferred to the hospital for further management of a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient is currently chest pain-free, and cardiac catheterization is planned for the morning. The patient is on various medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole.

Assessment and Plan:
1. STEMI: The patient has positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with an inferior region STEMI. The plan is to proceed with cardiac catheterization in the morning. The patient will continue on aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and atorvastatin.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure in the setting of an inferior MI. Other possible causes include hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. IV fluids will be given as needed to increase preload, and dopamine will be started if necessary for mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of renal failure and had a potassium level"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically. Lipids
   well controlled.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt would recommend stopping tomorrow (after 48
   hours)
   - Reduce atorvastatin from 80mg to 20 mg daily given LFT abnormalities
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening multi-organ dysfunction
   with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increasing the rate with inotropic agents as
   this would exacerbate patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock. Likely the driving force behind the
   hyperkalemia.
   - Optimize hemodynamics to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue
   perfusion
   - Renal consult to maintain electrolytes, doubtful that hemodialysis
   would be medically feasible but renal can also decide if medically
   feasible, would appreciate their input
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemi a
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure verus acid shifts in
   setting of lactic acidosis.  K 6.7 on admission and peaked t waves on
   ekg in lateral leads.
   - calcium gluconate
   - Insulin/glucose
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs this am.
   - pantoprazole iv
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   - currently on heparin gtt for STEMI
   .
   # Osteoarthritis: restart oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower than
   pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic compromise)  will
   titrate up PRN
   .
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   .
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt, PPI
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: full, discussed with family. They understand that he has a poor
   prognosis but pt wants full code after seeing his brother die [**Name (NI) 303**]

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10860**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2197-4-21**] 13:31 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient presented with chest pain and has positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with a STEMI, likely in the inferior region. This indicates a compromised blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to further myocardial damage if not managed properly.

2. Hypotension and Shock: The patient has shown signs of hypotension and shock, possibly secondary to right ventricular failure in the setting of inferior MI. This can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock. This can worsen over time if not managed appropriately, leading to further kidney damage.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

5. Anemia: The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia, which may require ongoing management and treatment.

6. Pulmonary Embolism/DVT: Although the patient has an IVC filter in place, there is still a risk of developing pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and other risk factors.

   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening multi-organ dysfunction
   with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increasing the rate with inotropic agents as
   this would exacerbate patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock. Likely the driving force behind the
   hyperkalemia.
   - Optimize hemodynamics to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue
   perfusion
   - Renal consult to maintain electrolytes, doubtful that hemodialysis
   would be medically feasible but renal can also decide if medically
   feasible, would appreciate their input
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemi a
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to renal failure verus acid shifts in
   setting of lactic acidosis.  K 6.7 on admission and peaked t waves on
   ekg in lateral leads.
   - calcium gluconate
   - Insulin/glucose
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs this am.
   - pantoprazole iv
   - continue to monitor hct
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.
   - continue to monitor
   - currently on heparin gtt for STEMI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava filter, and a massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of a suspected STEMI. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including renal failure, hypotension, pain control, acute coronary syndrome, decubitus ulcer, and anemia. 

The patient's medical team has implemented various treatments and interventions including medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, atorvastatin, and pantoprazole. They have also initiated a plan for pain management and discussed the goals of care with the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
2. Acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion secondary to cardiogenic shock.
3. Hypotension, which may be related to the patient's age and baseline functionality.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis due to poor perfusion and elevated lactate levels.
5. Hyperkalemia, which may be related to renal failure or acid shifts.
6. Chronic iron deficiency anemia.
7. Osteoarthritis.
8. Sacral and foot decubitus ulcers.
9. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
10. Stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2197-4-21**]:
   1. Limited study due to technique and low lung volumes. Probable
   bilateral
   pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
   2. Opacity overlying the mid lower chest may represent a hiatal hernia
   or a tortuous-dilated aorta. PA and lateral view of the chest may be
   helpful in
   further evaluation.
   3. Prominence of the azygos vein.
   ECHO: [**2197-4-20**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   Microbiology: None

   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - continue heparin gtt would recommend stopping tomorrow (after 48
   hours)
   - check lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening organ dysfunction with
   worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is chest pain. The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and was transferred for further management of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), likely inferior region.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. STEMI: The patient has positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with STEMI, likely inferior region. Due to the patient's age and poor baseline functionality, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not recommended, and the patient will be managed medically. Medications include aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, continuation of heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, holding beta blocker due to hypotension, and consideration of initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) when blood pressure tolerates.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure in the setting of inferior MI. Hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are also considered. The patient now shows signs of worsening organ dysfunction with worsening liver function tests (LFTs), increased international normalized"

   left ventricular cavity is very small. Although the left ventricular
   ejection fraction is nominally within normal limits, the stroke volume
   is probably markedly decreased due to the small left ventricular
   volumes. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
   The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
   tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # STEMI:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with
   STEMI, likely inferior region.  Currently chest pain free.  Due to age
   and general poor baseline functionality, there is not much to gain from
   taking him for PCTA, therefore he will be managed medically. Lipids
   well controlled.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   - stop hep gtt
   - Continue atorvastatin 20 mg daily given LFT abnormalities
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi when BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure in setting of inferior MI.
   Would also consider hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock with LV
   dysfunction. Pt now with signs of worsening multi-organ dysfunction
   with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60
   - Would recommend against increasing the rate with inotropic agents as
   this would exacerbate patient
s severe diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN. Likely
   the driving force behind the hyperkalemia.
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   - family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus CMO
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to CHF after STEMI
   - continue to trend
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin
   - calcium gluconate
   - Insulin/glucose

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with an IVC filter, and massive gastrointestinal bleed. He presented with chest pain and was transferred for further management of STEMI. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including shock, oliguric renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, anemia, pulmonary embolism/DVT, osteoarthritis, sacral and foot decubitus ulcers, and a change in code status from full code to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. STEMI: The patient had a positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent with STEMI, likely inferior region. He is currently chest pain-free, but there is a potential risk of recurrent chest pain, further myocardial damage, or complications related to the inferior wall involvement.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock secondary to right ventricular failure in the setting of inferior MI. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is most likely secondary to hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing acute tubular necrosis. This can result in further deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate"

   24 Hour Events:
   - gave 500 cc bolus for low uop and BP (sbp 80s)
   - spoke with patient's [**Hospital1 69**]: on [**2197-3-30**], SCr was 1.2 and BUN 46
   - transfused 1 unit pRBCs
   - six units insulin, two amps glucose and Kayexalate for elevated K
   - echo showing severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with
   associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction
   - additional 500 cc fluid bolus at 8PM for MAPs in low 50s
   - spoke with HCP, [**Name (NI) 332**] [**Name (NI) 11956**] [[**Telephone/Fax (1) 11957**], [**Numeric Identifier 11958**](c)] to
   review clinical situation. She confirmed patient expressed wish to be
   full code; she is aware that rapid deterioration could occur suddenly.
   - Renal consulted - likely not candidate for HD, asked for urine lytes,
   they (Such) spoke to HCP and helped arrange family meeting. They
   recommend following K, but otherwise holding off on placement of line
   and HD until tomorrow.
   - Family meeting will be at 5 p.m. on Saturday (sorry - only time
   possible for HCP)
   - Was made DNR/DNI after extensive discussion with [**Doctor First Name **] about what
   full code would mean. The gravity of his illness was made clear. He
   said that he might like to go home, but this will depend on meeting.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   .
   # ST elevations:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent
   with STEMI, however this was not supported by the findings on
   echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one would expect
   with the lateral ST elevations.  Echo did show severe diastolic
   dysfunction and right systolic dysfunction.  The patient noted chest
   pain for several days prior to admission and was originally managed
   medically for what was thought to be STEMI because he was not a good
   candidate for catheterization and reperfusion.  However, in light of
   his echo findings which do not correlate well with his EKG findings,
   one must also consider other causes for his diffuse ST changes such as
   myo/pericarditis.  Pt also had uremia which may have precipitated
   this.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - stop plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - stop atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   .
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume dispite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is
   likely a new insult and may have been due to MI or PE.  Pt presented
   with signs of multi-organ dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising
   lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
 goal JVP 14-16 cm
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60 (would
   discourage use of inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and
   diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN.
   Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated electrolyte
   disturbances causing the EKG changes
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal

","Summary of Progress Note:

- Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**], an 85-year-old nursing home resident, has a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with inferior vena cava filter, and massive gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with chest pain and was transferred for further management of suspected STEMI.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle with associated right ventricular systolic dysfunction, hypotension, oliguric renal failure, hyperkalemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, and a possible new pulmonary embolism.
- The patient's medical history, lab results, and imaging studies suggest a complex clinical picture involving cardiac dysfunction, renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, and potential complications such as DVT/PE and pressure ulcers.
- The patient's code status has been changed from full code to DNR/DNI, indicating a shift in the goals of care discussion with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and evidence of multi-organ dysfunction suggest cardiogenic shock secondary to right ventricular failure, hypertrophic left ventricle with poor stroke volume, and aortic stenosis.

2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to hypoperfusion secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing acute tubular"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # ST elevations:  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes consistent
   with STEMI, however this was not supported by the findings on
   echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one would expect
   with the lateral ST elevations.  Echo did show severe diastolic
   dysfunction and right systolic dysfunction.  The patient noted chest
   pain for several days prior to admission and was originally managed
   medically for what was thought to be STEMI because he was not a good
   candidate for catheterization and reperfusion.  However, in light of
   his echo findings which do not correlate well with his EKG findings,
   one must also consider other causes for his diffuse ST changes such as
   myo/pericarditis.  Pt also had uremia which may have precipitated
   this.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - stop plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - stop atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   - discuss with family the goals of care, meeting scheduled for 5 pm
   today
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume dispite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is
   likely a new insult and may have been due to MI or PE.  Pt presented
   with signs of multi-organ dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising
   lactate, and rising creatinine.
   - IVFs as needed to increase preload, as long as O2 status remains
   stable
 goal JVP 14-16 cm
   - Consider a trial of phenylephrine gtt if needed for MAP > 60 (would
   discourage use of inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and
   diastolic dysfunction
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely secondary to hypoperfusion
   secondary to cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis causing ATN.
   Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated electrolyte
   disturbances causing the EKG changes
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - f/u urine lytes to confirm prerenal vs intrarenal
   - f.u renal U/S
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   - family meeting today to discuss dialysis versus CMO
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  K 6.7 on admission
   and peaked t waves on ekg in lateral leads.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.  This am potassium
   was hemolyzed
   - repeat potassium and check pm lytes as well
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs yesterday.
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.
   - obtain OSH records regarding time course of PE/DVT
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE (creatinine elevated preventing CT scan)
   - continue to monitor
   - stop heparin gtt today
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycodone with PRN doses (starting lower

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - Continue  phenylephrine gtt PRN for MAP > 60 (would discourage use of
   inotropic agents given hypertrophic heart and diastolic dysfunction
   - consider CTA with contrast removal by CVVH to r/o PE
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented to the hospital with chest pain and is being managed for a suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient has multiple medical complications including shock, oliguric renal failure, hyperkalemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, potential pulmonary embolism/DVT, osteoarthritis, sacral and foot decubitus, and a recent change in code status to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing right ventricular (RV) failure, hypertrophic left ventricular (LV) with poor stroke volume, and aortic stenosis. These factors contribute to poor forward flow and decreased LV preload, leading to hypotension and signs of multi-organ dysfunction. The most likely etiologies include myocardial infarction (MI) or PE.
2. Oliguric renal failure: The patient has pre-renal azotemia secondary to hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size secondary to hypertrophy and newly failed RV worsening LV preload. CVVH is being initiated to manage renal failure.
3. Hyperkalemia"

   - renal estimates 24-48 hrs before he declines rapidly given the rate
   of his refractory hyperkalemia
   - After seeing the [**Doctor Last Name **] which did not show regional wall motion
   abnormailty c/w ST elevations, discussed that his renal failure may not
   be secondary to cardiogenic shock, but rather the inciting incident
   that caused his uremia which may have led to the EKG changes; because
   this may potentially be reversible, discussed with renal and pt the
   option of CVVH and pt wishes to go forward

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Events over past 24 hours reviewed with CCU team:
   Decision for CVVH based on possible recovery of RV function, absence of
   evidence of STEMIn as etiology, possible  improved cardiac output and
   acute renal insult (normal kidney size);
   Line placement and CVVH in progress with good tolerance
   Physical Examination
   Pericardial rub not heard today; short 2/6 systolic murmur of AS; no
   diastolic murmur;
   less alert currently;
   Medical Decision Making
   Willl continue CVVH and follow renal parameters with renal team;
   Trial fluid bolus as means to improve LV preload and cardiac output;
   Continue low dose phenylephrine for BP support

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**], an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, and massive gastrointestinal bleed, presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and was transferred for further management of suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's medical history includes a previous DVT in [**2186**], IVC filter placement in [**2183**], PE in [**2190**], AV malformation with large GI bleed requiring large transfusion and right hemicolectomy in [**1-14**], and AAA repair in [**2197-3-19**]. The patient's current condition includes oliguric renal failure, hyperkalemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, chronic iron deficiency anemia, and right ventricular dysfunction. The patient has been started on CVVH, phenylephrine, and heparin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock secondary to right ventricular failure, hypertrophic left ventricle with poor stroke volume, and aortic stenosis. The right ventricular failure may be due to a recent insult such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.
2. Oliguric renal failure: The patient"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).

   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine. Rising lactate most likely secondary to phenylephrine
   causing peripheral vasoconstriction and end-organ damage
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - Trial of dopamine today
   - monitor BP closely
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Lactate high at 18, now at 12, and AG
   from 35 to 22 after DC
ing phenylephrine, most likely secondary to
   severe cardiogenic shock exacerbated by vasoconstriction in effort to
   maintain blood pressures.
   - DC phenylephrine
   - Bolus PRN, with caution given patient is oliguric
   - Trial of dopamine per above
   - continue to trend
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - Would recommend against CVVH, as would likely be medically futile
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 50) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus and dopamine)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix given bleeding risk and questionable benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Liver failure: Patient with liver failure leading to worsening
   coaggulopathy and hypoglycemic secondary to impaired gluconeogenisis,
   and probably contributing to the elevated lactate.
   - trend enzymes
   - avoid Tylenol
   - treat underlying condition with IVF and dopamine trial today
   # Anemia:  HCT drop likely hemodilutional in setting of receiving
   several liters of fluid and all counts being down. Chronic iron
   deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive contents in ileostomy.
   Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct, recheck at CBC at 1pm, if HCT <25 can offer
   transfusion to family during meeting today if they still favor
   aggressive management
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt for now, pending goals of care discussion
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac, renal and diabetic diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**]), will have a goals of care discussion

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is chest pain. The patient has been experiencing several hypoglycemic episodes in the morning, and insulin has been decreased. The patient also has a bicarb level of 10, which indicates acidosis. The patient's temperature and respiratory rate are mildly increased, prompting an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, which reveals a very acidotic condition with a lactate level of 16. The patient's only complaint remains right hip pain.

The patient's volume has been repleted with 2L D5W and 3 amps NaHCO3 to address the acidosis. An urgent abdominal/hip CT scan showed basically negative results, except for one area near the AAA graft that could potentially represent a tiny endoleak, although it is difficult to say on this study (definitely not a major leak per radiology). The patient has advanced degenerative disease of the right hip.

The patient has allergies to no known drugs. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 04/23/2197 at 02:30 PM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04/24/2197 at 07:10 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium at a rate of 550 units/hour and Morphine Sulfate.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 11927**] is an 85 [**Hospital 11928**] nursing home resident with a history of
   HTN, ?hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PE s/p IVC filter, massive GI bleed
   who presented to [**Hospital3 1492**] with chest pain and is transferred for
   further management of STEMI.
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to RV failure, hypertrophic LV with poor
   stroke volume despite normal EF, and aortic stenosis.  RV failure is a
   new insult compared with echo in [**5-14**] when RV was normal.  Most likely
   etiologies include MI or PE.  Pt presented with signs of multi-organ
   dysfunction with worsening LFTs, INR, rising lactate, and rising
   creatinine.  Started on pressors last night to maintain MAP above 60.
   - IVF bolus now that on CVVH and risk of fluid overload mitigated with
   ability to remove fluid
   - DC phenylephrine
   - monitor BP closely
   # Oliguric renal failure: Most likely pre-renal secondary to
   hypoperfusion from poor forward flow due to decreased LV chamber size
   secondary to hypertrophy, and newly failed right ventricle worsening LV
   preload.  Although alternatively a renal insult may have precipitated
   electrolyte disturbances causing the EKG changes, this is less likely
   given time course (creatinine 1.2 in [**2197-3-6**])  and normal renal U/S
   - CVVH
   - Optimize hemodynamics (MAP > 60) to maintain adequate cardiac output
   and tissue perfusion (IVF bolus)
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Renal diet, renally dose meds
   - Kayaxalate and insulin/glucose for hyperkalemia
   .
   # ST elevations:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from pericarditis caused by uremia (Friction
   rub heard on exam yesterday).  Positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes
   consistent also with STEMI, however this was not supported by the
   findings on echocardiogram which did not show LV dysfunction which one
   would expect with the lateral ST elevations.
   - continue asprin 325 daily
   - holding plavix, heparin gtt given bleeding risk and questionable
   benefit
   - holding atorvastatin given elevated liver enzymes and questionable
   benefit in the short term due to limited life expectancy
   - holding beta blocker given hypotension
   - consider initiation of ACEi if BP tolerates
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely related to renal failure.  Pt has received
   kayexalate, bicarb, calcium gluconate, and insulin.
   - lytes per renal protocol
   - remove potassium through CVVH
   - calcium gluconate PRN
   - Insulin/glucose PRN
   - follow closely on tele for PR prolongation, QRS widening, etc.
   - Daily EKGs until peak t-waves resolve
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Found to have elevated lactate.
   Likely from poor perfusion due to decreased stroke volume
   - continue to trend
   # Anemia:  Chronic iron deficiency anemia with trace guaiac positive
   contents in ileostomy.  Transfused 1 unit RBCs [**2197-3-21**].
   - PO pantoprazole
   - continue to monitor hct
   # Pulmonary embolism/DVT:  Not on coumadin because of history of GI
   bleed.  IVC filter in place.  However new PE might explain right heart
   dysfunction.  OSH showed pt had PE while on Coumadin and with IVC
   filter in [**2190**].  Recently stopped Coumadin [**2-15**] due to ENT bleed.
   (also known to have GI bleed in [**1-14**]).
   - consider V/Q scan to r/o PE vs CTA
   - continue to monitor
   - continue heparin gtt
   # Osteoarthritis: continue oxycontin with PRN oxycodone doses (starting
   lower than pt home dose to prevent hypoxia or other hemodynamic
   compromise)  will titrate up PRN
   # Sacral and foot decubs:  would care consult
   # Goals of care: pt recently changed from full code to DNR/DNI.
   # DVT ppx: heparin gtt
   # FEN:  IVFs as above, cardiac healthy diet
   # CODE: DNR/DNI (since [**2197-4-21**])

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old nursing home resident with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, and massive gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented with chest pain and was transferred for further management of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).

The patient's current condition includes shock, oliguric renal failure, ST elevations on EKG, hyperkalemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, pulmonary embolism/DVT (deep vein thrombosis), osteoarthritis, sacral and foot decubitus ulcers, and a change in code status from full code to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

The patient is currently being treated with various medications and interventions including pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), and medications for hyperkalemia and anemia. The patient is also on prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT and stress ulcer prevention.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 77/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation heart rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, liver enzymes, and potassium. Imaging studies reveal low lung volumes, unchanged heart size, and aortobifemoral graft in place with a questionable hyperdense area that could indicate a small endoleak.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening renal failure, further deterioration of cardiac function, development of additional decubitus ulcers, progression of anemia, and possible recurrence of pulmonary embolism/DVT despite ongoing anticoagulation therapy."
