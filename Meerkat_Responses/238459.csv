   Fever: leading sources include CNS, urine, lung, abd or skin. of these
   leading concern would be for CNS infection although mental status now
   markedly improved and CSF underwhelming. with underlying immune
   suppressed state would be at risk for HSV or listeria which could be
   more consistent with atypical infections. also chest xray normal and

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease on chronic steroids, admitted with fever, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis. The patient's fever has several potential sources including the central nervous system (CNS), urine, lung, abdomen, or skin. The leading concern is a CNS infection, although the patient's mental status has improved and CSF analysis is underwhelming. The patient also has an underlying immune-suppressed state, which increases the risk for atypical infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Listeria.

The patient is currently being treated empirically for meningitis with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. Dexamethasone is also being continued. If there is no improvement, an MRI of the head will be pursued.

The patient's lactic acidosis is not likely due to systemic hypoperfusion since her blood pressure is normal to elevated. There is no abdominal pain suggesting ischemic bowel, and the patient's home use of metformin is likely contributing to the condition. Lactate levels will be trended, and hydration will be continued.

There is no current evidence of a Crohn's flare with abdominal symptoms, so the patient will continue steroids above then taper to home dose. The patient's neuropathy regimen will also be continued, and the fentanyl patch will be decreased in the setting of fever.

   57 year old woman with history of Crohns disease on chronic steroids
   admitted with fever, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis.
   HCT drop: from admission dropped from 34 to 25-28 range.  She was
   dehydrated on admission, and has received large volume of IVF.  She is
   iron deficient based on labs.  This is likely a combination of
   underlying iron deficiency and dilution.
   -continue to monitor
   -consider iron as an outpatient
   Fever: leading concern would be for CNS infection although mental
   status now markedly improved and CSF underwhelming. Given underlying
   immune suppressed state would be at risk for HSV or listeria which
   could be more consistent with atypical infections. CXR, UA, and blood
   cultures unremarkable at this time.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease who is currently on chronic steroids. She was admitted to the ICU with fever, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis. The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration from admission, which is being monitored and observed. Iron deficiency is also noted.

The patient's fever is a leading concern, and there is a suspicion of a central nervous system (CNS) infection. The mental status has improved, but given the patient's immune-suppressed state, she is at risk for HSV or listeria infections. The patient is receiving empirical meningitis dosing, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir for 48 hours.

The patient's altered mental status appears to be improving, and her neuro exam is normal. The treatment for infections mentioned earlier is recommended.

Lactic acidosis is present, but it is unlikely to be due to systemic hypoperfusion since the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits. There is no abdominal pain suggesting ischemic bowel, and the patient's home use of metformin could be contributing to the lactic acidosis. The anion gap has closed, and lactate levels are decreasing.

There is no current evidence of a Crohn's flare or neuropathy. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being managed in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the CNS infection"

   57 year old woman with history of Crohns disease on chronic steroids
   admitted with fever, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis.
   HCT drop: from admission dropped from 34 to 25-28 range.  She was
   dehydrated on admission, and has received large volume of IVF.  She is
   iron deficient based on labs.  This is likely a combination of
   underlying iron deficiency and dilution.
   -continue to monitor
   -consider iron as an outpatient
   Fever: leading concern would be for CNS infection although mental
   status now markedly improved and CSF underwhelming. Given underlying
   immune suppressed state would be at risk for HSV or listeria which
   could be more consistent with atypical infections. CXR, UA, and blood
   cultures unremarkable at this time.

   - HSV PCR
   - empiric mengingoencephalitis dosing for now:
   vanc/ceftriaxone/ampicillin (confirmed ADR to penicillin as not c/w
   allergy)/acyclovir for 48 hours
   Altered Mental status: appears to be markedly improved compared to
   pre-admission eval. Neuro exam wnl
   - treat infections as above
   Lactic acidosis: not likely systemic hypoperfusing given normal to
   elevated blood pressure. no abdominal pain to suggest ischemic bowel.
   home use of metformin likely contributing.  Anion gap has closed, and
   lactate 3 today down from admission of 5
   - trend lactate

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease on chronic steroids, admitted with fever, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis.
- The patient experienced a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 34 to 25-28 range since admission, which was likely due to dehydration and large volume of intravenous fluids received. She is also iron deficient based on lab results.
- The patient's fever is a leading concern, and there is a suspicion of a central nervous system (CNS) infection. However, mental status has improved, and CSF analysis does not show any significant findings.
- The patient is at risk for atypical infections such as HSV or listeria due to her immune-suppressed state. Blood cultures, urine analysis (UA), and chest X-ray are unremarkable.
- The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir for 48 hours.
- The patient's altered mental status has improved significantly, and neurologic exam is normal.
- Lactic acidosis is not likely due to systemic hypoperfusion, and the anion gap has closed with decreasing lactate levels.
- There is no evidence of a Crohn's flare or abdominal symptoms at present.
- The patient's neuropathy is being managed with her home regimen, and the fentanyl patch is being decreased in the setting"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease who was admitted to the ICU with fever, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/59 mmHg to 123/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has several allergies, including sulfonamides, morphine, iodine, cephalexin, bupropion, and simvastatin. 

The patient received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and ampicillin. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels. 

The patient's assessment and plan include treating potential infections, such as CNS infection, with empirical meningitis dosing of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. The patient is also being treated for lactic acidosis, and her Crohn's disease management involves continuing steroids with plans to taper to home dose. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening of the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease, chronic steroid use, and various medical conditions. She was admitted to the ICU with fevers, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis. Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped from 34% to 25-28 range upon admission, indicating possible dehydration. She received a large volume of intravenous fluids, but her HCT continues to trend down to 21%. The patient is also iron deficient. She has been started on metformin for her condition. Antibiotics were initially given but discontinued after 48 hours due to unremarkable cultures. The patient's altered mental status has improved. She has no evidence of a Crohn's flare and will continue her home regimen of medications for neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, and depression/anxiety. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but she requires close monitoring. Potential medical complications include further HCT drop, infection, and possible ICU-acquired conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of headache, fever, and photophobia. Her initial presentation was concerning for meningoencephalitis, but subsequent laboratory tests showed normal protein levels and no evidence of CSF pleocytosis. This suggests that her condition may be more likely due to a viral syndrome.

The patient has experienced hypoperfusion, but it has resolved clinically. Her lactate levels are trending down, indicating improvement. It is planned to check for nasal viral DFA and continue antibiotic therapy until CSF cultures are negative for 48 hours. Acyclovir treatment will be continued until CSF HSV PCR is negative.

The patient has a history of chronic steroid use, and her home dose will be continued for now. If hypotension recurs, stress dose steroids may be administered. There is no evidence of acute Crohn's flare, so no intervention is needed at this time. The patient's HCT drop may be dilutional and does not show any signs of bleeding or infection.

The patient is currently on a po diet for nutrition and will continue ICU care. Glycemic control will be maintained, and the patient has multiple lines inserted. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers is in place. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

","Summary:
The patient is currently experiencing lactic acidosis and is admitted to the ICU. They have a history of allergies to sulfonamides, morphine, iodine, cephalexin, Wellbutrin Sr, Simvastatin, and diarrhea from cephalexin. The patient has received antibiotics including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin. They are on various infusions and medications in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure but a decreasing hematocrit level. They have a sinus rhythm, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2417 mL, output of 1665 mL, and a negative balance of 752 mL. Their respiratory support includes oxygen supplementation. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.28. The physical examination findings are incomplete as many assessments were not performed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose level is also elevated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's elevated lactate levels and previous antibiotic administration suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection leading to septic shock.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate AKI.
3. Hypotension: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with headache, fever, photophobia.  Her initial
   presentation was quite concerning for meningoencephalitis.  However,
   her LP is quite reassuring with normal protein and no evidence for CSF
   pleocytosis.
   Sepsis
   -          hypoperfusion has resolved clinically
   -          repeat lactate
   -          check nasal viral DFA
   -          continue ABX until CSF cx (-) for 48 hours
   -          continue acyclovir until CSF HSV PCR (-)
   -          we are unable to check CT abdomen without significant risk,
   since she has a true contrast allergy.  Her exam is reassuring.
   -          We will follow clinically and consider ID consult if
   recrudescent symptoms with unrevealing evaluation
   Chronic steroid use
          Continue home dose for now
          If hypotension recurs
 stress dose steroids

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with symptoms of headache, fever, and photophobia. Her initial presentation was concerning for meningoencephalitis, but subsequent laboratory tests showed normal protein levels and no evidence of CSF pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.

The patient has a history of chronic steroid use, Crohn's disease, and anemia. She also has allergies to sulfonamides, morphine, iodine, cephalexin, and an unknown allergy causing hives on her arm. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has trended down to 21% while her blood pressure has remained stable. She has received various antibiotics, including acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 69-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/76 mmHg to 151/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 12-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is currently on respiratory support with an unspecified mode.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (H"
